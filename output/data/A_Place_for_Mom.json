      "# [What Is Senior Living? Costs, Benefits and Options by Jess Mathews on 2024-02-19](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living)\nSenior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:\n\nSenior apartments and independent living communities: The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.\n\nHome care and assisted living communities: The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.\n\nMemory care: The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.\n\nNursing homes: The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.\n\nThe costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.\n\nSenior living options range from senior apartments and other 55+ communities to nursing homes. The biggest difference between each option is the level of care they provide to residents.\n\nFor independent seniors who don’t need assistance, senior apartments or independent living may be the right fit. Active seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs) may strike a balance of independence and support in assisted living communities or board and care homes. However, seniors with complex health conditions or a form of dementia may benefit more from memory care communities or nursing homes.\n\nDepending on the needs of the senior, home care or home health care may be a good fit. Home care services can provide companionship and daily support, while home health care services can offer prescribed in-home skilled nursing care.\n\nTypically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.\n\nKnowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from A Place for Mom’s 2024 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\n\nWhen it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.\n\nFinding the right senior living option comes down to three questions: What are your needs, what are your retirement goals, and what is your budget? Knowing the answer to these questions should help you narrow down which option will fit your family’s needs best. For example, if your loved one doesn’t require care services, but wants to pursue new hobbies and make new friendships, independent living might be a better option than a senior apartment or assisted living environment.\n\nAbove all else, the best way to determine which senior living option is best is to tour. Touring allows families to meet community staff and residents, ask questions, evaluate floor plans, and truly get a sense of what life in that community would look like. According to our data, 97% of families tour before making a final decision about their senior living options.\n\nMoving can be a big adjustment, which is why it’s best to plan ahead. Consider the significant change you or a senior loved one will go through. A successful move is key for a positive transition into a new environment and lifestyle.\n\nBelow are some top tips for an easy senior living move:\n\nChoose one room at a time for packing and downsizing.\n\nConsider hiring a professional senior relocation service.\n\nWork with a geriatric care manager to make sure there is e access to health care providers and prescriptions after the move.\n\nConsider mobility needs to find the best way to travel, whether by car or plane.",
      "# [What Is Memory Care? Services, Cost, and Benefits by seanleong on 2024-02-09](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care)\nMemory care is a type of long-term care community designed to meet the specific needs of individuals with a dementia diagnosis, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Memory care facilities offer 24-hour care and supervision, secured environments, specialized staff trained in dementia care, and memory-enhancing activities and therapies. Memory care can take place in apartment-like facilities, within a wing of an assisted living facility, or in smaller residential care homes. The goal of memory care is to provide an engaging, safe, and therapeutic environment for seniors with dementia to support their well-being and improve their quality of life. Individuals in the middle to later stages of dementia benefit most from a memory care environment.\n\nBenefits of memory care\n\nBecause dementia symptoms worsen over time, elderly adults with dementia are often unable to continue to live independently in their homes. If a family member is unable to take on the caregiver role, which can quickly become a full-time job, memory care is a great option. Memory care not only benefits seniors with dementia but also families who are feeling overwhelmed by their loved one’s advanced care needs. It gives families peace of mind that their loved one is in a secure and therapeutic environment with caregivers trained to handle difficult dementia behaviors.\n\nRead on to learn all about memory care benefits, specialized services, costs, and payment options. We also offer free tips on finding and moving to a community in your area.\n\nThe median national cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to proprietary data gathered by A Place for Mom. Costs vary greatly between communities and depend on factors like location, community amenities, programming, apartment size, and the level of care a senior requires. Pricing models also vary. For instance, some memory care communities may be all-inclusive, while others may use an a la carte approach and charge based on services required by a resident.\n\nMemory care base costs typically cover rent, utilities, meals and snacks, housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, on-site activities, nonmedical therapies, and shared amenities. However, some amenities — such as in-unit internet service, beauty and barber services, laundry, and pet accommodations — may cost extra.\n\nWhile many families look to savings to finance senior care, there are other little-known funding sources that can help. The articles below can help you better understand pricing and the options available to help pay for memory care.",
      "# [What is a Nursing Home? Services, Cost and Options by Grace Hobson on 2024-02-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes)\nNursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for seniors. Nursing homes offer the highest level of care for seniors who need long-term or short-term medical care but don’t need hospitalization. Elderly adults who need long-term care at a nursing home often have severe physical or cognitive health conditions that require 24-hour nursing care. They may be incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to transfer from bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a staff member.\n\nNursing homes play a crucial role in post-hospitalization care. They offer short-term rehabilitation for seniors recovering from illnesses, accidents or surgery. Rehab care focuses on restoring mobility, strength, and function so seniors can get back to their normal activities.\n\nNursing homes provide a distinctly higher level of medical care than other types of senior living, such as independent living, assisted living, and memory care. Nursing homes can also be called “care homes,” “skilled rehab facilities,” or “long-term care facilities.”\n\nFinding a nursing home for your loved one may feel overwhelming. You may have many different facilities to choose from, so how do you know which one is right? Start with your family member’s prioritized needs and consider the facility’s medical services and ratings.\n\nUltimately, there’s no substitute for visiting and experiencing a typical day at the nursing home. As you tour different facilities, be sure to ask whether the nursing home you’re visiting is Medicare or Medicaid certified and licensed if you plan on using your benefits to help cover your care costs there. You can also check the facility’s rating on the Medicare website.\n\nUse these resources to discover what to look for when searching for a nursing home and how to find the best nursing homes near you.",

She went above and beyond to help my brother-in-law get relocated even setting up the apartment for him with furniture. The staff at the atria are friendly and respectful to the residents. their transportation services are offered daily for residence by appointment. All of the other places we visited, only had transportation services certain days of the week. There is a lot more like they’re dining hall is really a restaurant and they have an outdoor heated pool, and the apartments have terrific amenities. It was the best place we’ve visited with the best staff.\n\nWe are absolutely delighted to be residents of Atria Oakridge\n\nWe are so pleased with our surroundings. Our apartment is well appointed, two baths, one is walk in with grip bars easily reached. Full kitchen and even enough room for our dining table. There are many activities to choose from and residents and staff are friendly and welcoming. The dining facilities are open, bright and clean. The food is quite good with many options including pickup, or delivered to your apartment if needed. There is many more services to help us if and when they would be needed.\n\nWonderful staff clean and comfortable units. Medical support excellant\n\nHighly recommend this memory care unit. The staff are compassionate, caring, attentive and very professional. They are always available to answer questions and concerns. It is a very happy atmosphere which really makes a difference . I feel my mother is well cared for and safe. The facility itself is beautiful and very clean. It has truly exceeded my expectations.\n\nClean and friendly facility.\n\nWhen we went on a tour of the facility, we were surprised how friendly the workers and residents were. We felt comfortable and my father in law knew right away that he wanted to live there. So we started the process. We also ate there with him and the food was good. Definitely a place I would recommend.\n\nmom is thriving\n\nNote that Atria has taken over Maplewood from Holiday. They have been hiring Dining room, housekeeping, activities staff. The transition in ongoing They expect both the food and housekeeping to improve. Maplewood place is truly a \"community\" where residents become family quickly. My mother moved in on [date removed] after 3 hospitalizations and an extended rehab stay in 2 months. Her transformation has been amazing as she has regained independence because of the dedicated and caring staff. She has many friends and is engaged in many activities from coloring and painting to beading to ceramics and other arts and crafts. She's involved in games and bingo and happy hour. They've gone to a local casino, an apple farm with a hayride and local restaurants. The residents watch over and care about each other. The community has truly brought her peace, joy and happiness. The dining room is exceptional. It's truly like being in a restaurant. The courtyard is beautiful and provided many fun and peaceful moments in the spring and summer.\n\nPerfect Fit!\n\n2 1/2 years ago after visiting many Assisted Living Facilities, I decided on choosing yours. I am still happy with that decision. I never have to worry about the level of care received & always appreciate the added attention.

Everything that it has to offer. My family and I are very happy with my home. Very happy with our choice.\n\nReview for Atria Willow Glen\n\nAlthough my dad has dementia, he is not currently at this stage where he needs dementia care, or memory care... they wanted a form filled out that would say that he had dementia that would make him go into memory care. Atria actually was able to accept him living independently because his dementia is not at the stage where he needs memory care. This was a big hurdle for us.\n\nA New Home\n\nI moved into the Atria Forest Hills more than two weeks ago. It feels very good to be here, and I like it here very much. There are many good activities to participate in and to be with people. I like eating in the dining room with other people.

My apartment is also large and comfortable, and faces the park and a lake.\n\nReview for Atria Center City\n\nI met the staff and had a tour and like everything immediately. It was the only place I looked at after researching online, and after my visit, I didn't need to look anywhere else. I would highly recommend Atria to anyone!\n\nTop notch care\n\nThe facility is very clean, and the staff keeps on top of it. I visited daily and saw staff cleaning all the time. The staff is friendly, caring, and welcoming. The quality of care was top notch. My mom had some special needs, and the staff was very accommodating. The meals were varied, nutritious, and delicious.

      "# [Assisted Living In Missouri](https://www.aplaceformom.com/assisted-living/missouri)\n“Private pay” is a term that describes using your own personal funds to pay for something.

Many of the families we refer to assisted living use a combination of personal funds to pay, including the following common options.\n\nFamilies in Missouri can generate income to pay for assisted living by selling a house.\n\nAnother tool seniors in Missouri can use to pay for assisted living is a reverse mortgage, which is a loan that turns a borrower’s home equity into funds to pay for long-term care expenses.\n\nIn Missouri some seniors may be able to use the funds in a health savings account to cover some expenses associated with assisted living.\n\nSeniors with life insurance policies may be able to use benefits to pay for long term care in Missouri.

While memory care facilities usually provide the same general care services as a standard assisted living community, they also include additional services and safety features specific to dementia care.\n\nIn Texas, there may be other factors that affect the cost of assisted living including:\n\nLocation\n\nFloorplans and the size of resident dwellings\n\nSpecialty gourmet meals\n\nLuxury features and amenities\n\nMany qualified seniors use Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance, and/or veteran’s benefits to help reduce the costs of medically necessary care in assisted living.\n\nEvery family’s financial situation is unique, so the earlier you assess your aging loved one’s finances and set a budget, the more choices you’re likely to have. Additionally, if you’re planning to use Medicare or Medicaid to cover medical expenses while living at an assisted living community, understand that applications and spend-down periods may take some time, making planning ahead essential.\n\nNumerous families blend private and public funds to cover the expenses of assisted living. For a comprehensive look at how to long-term care, refer to our complete guide to paying for long-term care.\n\nThe Texas Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) categorizes assisted living facilities, referred to as ALFs in Texas, as a Type A or Type B facility. Residents of Type A facilities are able to follow directions in an emergency and don’t require overnight assistance. Type B facility residents require assistance with emergency evacuations and supervision overnight.[01]\n\nAssisted living facilities in Texas are inspected at least once every two years and inspection reports can be viewed using the Long-term Care Provider Search. To use the search tool follow these steps:\n\nChose location or provider name at top of search box\n\nEnter city, county or zip code\n\nChoose type of assisted living facility type from type of care drop down menu\n\nScroll to find desired facility\n\nIn addition to inspecting the building to ensure that the facility is physically safe for residents, HHS also checks the facility complies with state laws and regulations which include the following:[01]\n\nStaff qualifications and compliance with background checks\n\nManagement of the facility\n\nRecords of resident health assessments\n\nFacility is providing proper care and services\n\nRoom capacity\n\nMedication management and administration procedures\n\nEase of access to Texas assisted living records\n\nWe developed a system to rate each state on how easy – or difficult – it is to find important assisted living records and reports, and compiled tips to help you in your search.\n\nStates with the most transparent records allow you to look up important information about each assisted living facility online, including inspections, complaints, survey results, violations, capacity, and whether the facility accepts Medicaid.\n\nAccess to Texas assisted living records: High\n\nPublic access to assisted living records and reports for the state of Texas is high.

      "# [[Rates & Eligibility] VA Benefits for Senior Care by Diego Fallas on 2021-04-16](https://www.aplaceformom.com/veterans-benefits-guide)\nVA benefits for long-term care\n\nSenior care can be costly, but for some U.S. military veterans and their surviving spouses, certain veterans benefits may be available to help offset long-term care costs. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, offers benefits for those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces, including Aid and Attendance and Housebound benefits, which provide financial assistance for long-term care.\n\nSadly, many veterans are completely unaware of the benefits available to them — and that means some veterans are paying more for their care than they should. A Place for Mom has helped guide more than 410,000 veterans in their searches for senior care and housing. Part of this assistance involves making veterans and their families aware of benefits that they have earned, but may not know about. This complete guide to VA benefits for long-term care covers who qualifies for benefits, the types of benefits available to help pay for long-term care, and how to apply for veterans benefits.\n\nBack to top\n\nWho qualifies for VA benefits?\n\nGenerally, the following military connected individuals may be eligible for VA benefits:\n\nDisabled or ill veterans\n\nWartime veterans\n\nVeterans with recognized toxic exposures\n\nOther veterans\n\nVeteran spouses\n\nSurviving spouses\n\nSurviving children\n\nOther veteran dependents\n\nVA long-term care eligibility requirements\n\nVA long-term care benefit programs vary, and each come with specific requirements that must be met for people to qualify. Depending on the specific VA benefit program a senior is applying for, requirements can include considerations of the following:\n\nU.S. military service history\n\nNumber of days on active duty\n\nAge of the veteran\n\nWartime service specifics\n\nCharacter of discharge\n\nNecessity of a caregiver’s assistance to complete activities of daily living\n\nClinical assessments and diagnoses\n\nFinancial need or low-income status\n\nMental or physical disabilities\n\nStatus as a surviving dependent family member\n\nMarriage or familial relation to a veteran\n\nIn addition, veterans typically can’t have committed an act that constitutes a statutory bar from VA benefits, such as desertion, being a conscientious objector, or going on absence without official leave (AWOL), according to the VA.\n\nBack to top\n\nVeterans benefits can cover the cost of long-term care\n\nMany veterans benefits, like the VA Pension, the Aid and Attendance benefit, and the Housebound allowance, can be used to help cover the costs of long-term care. The Aid and Attendance benefit is most generous and can help with monthly costs of living for seniors, including those looking to live a private senior living community.\n\nVeterans benefits can vary greatly from person to person. For example, one person’s VA Pension stipend may be more generous than another’s. What a veteran or dependent is awarded depends on the many requirement details listed in the section above. It’s important to first identify which programs your loved one might qualify for to see what they could potentially receive.\n\nRead on for some VA programs that many senior veterans or their families utilize to improve their overall quality of life.\n\nVA Pension and Survivors Pension\n\nThe VA provides supplemental income to veterans and their families through the Veterans Pension and Survivors Pension benefit programs. These tax-free benefits are paid monthly and available to eligible U.S. military veterans or their surviving dependents, respectively. These VA Pensions are based on need and benefit amounts change each year based on that year’s Maximum Annual Pension Rates (or MAPR). What a beneficiary receives depends on their eligibility as well as their countable income. View the latest Veterans Pension rates and Survivors Pensions rates online, and learn how monthly stipends are calculated.\n\nIt’s important to note that the Veterans Pension is separate from a U.S. military pension. However, money from a military pension can also be used to pay for costs related to long-term care.\n\nIf your loved one qualifies for a VA Pension, they may also be eligible for add-on VA benefits that can help pay for senior care, such as the Aid and Attendance benefit or Housebound allowance.\n\nAid and Attendance\n\nThe VA Aid and Attendance benefit provides supplemental income for eligible veterans and surviving spouses who already receive the VA Pension and require senior care either at home or at a senior living facility. If your loved one is unable to live independently, is blind, or needs help with some of their activities of daily living (ADLs), they may qualify for the Aid and Attendance. Aid and Attendance pays a monthly amount that’s added to the VA Pension or Survivors Pension and can help pay for senior care and costs of living.\n\nHousebound allowance\n\nThe VA Housebound allowance is for veterans and eligible dependents who spend most of their time at home because of a permanent disability. People who qualify for the Housebound allowance are confined to their home or need the assistance when leaving their home for medical appointments or medically necessary treatments.\n\nVA disability compensation\n\nVeterans who became sick or injured during their service, or who had a medical condition that worsened due to their service, may be able to receive specialized support through VA disability compensation. Unlike many other VA benefits, this benefit is not based upon financial need.\n\nVeterans may spend this funding at their discretion, which means it can be used for senior living expenses if a veteran so chooses. See the latest VA disability compensation payment amounts online.\n\nVA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)\n\nSurviving dependents or parents of deceased veterans, who passed away from a service-connected medical condition or who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, may be able to receive support through the VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefit, also known as DIC. Not all survivors may qualify for the DIC benefit, but those that do may receive monthly tax-free payments.\n\nThese payments can be spent at the discretion of the survivor, including paying for long-term care expenses. View the latest VA DIC rates online to see what survivors may qualify for.\n\nVA Health Care\n\nEligible veterans enrolled in VA Health Care may receive long-term care services through the VA. Some covered long-term care services under VA Health Care may include the following:\n\nPhysical therapy\n\n24/7 nursing and medical care\n\nPalliative care\n\nHospice care\n\nRespite care\n\nIn-home primary care\n\nCommunity care\n\nAssistance with activities of daily living, such as dressing or bathing\n\nPain management\n\nVA health benefits may be received in a variety of settings, which may be run by the VA or community providers. Depending on the availability of services in your loved one’s area, community care settings may include:\n\nA veteran’s residence\n\nAssisted living communities\n\nAdult day health centers\n\nNursing homes\n\nVA Community Living Centers (VA Nursing Homes)\n\nThe VA operates more than 100 VA Community Living Centers nationwide. These are nursing homes that can provide eligible veterans with 24-hour skilled nursing care, mental health resources, specialized dementia care, and more, depending on the community.\n\nWhile this nursing home care isn’t necessarily free, qualified veterans may find these communities to be a more affordable option. Copays may be charged to some veterans. A veteran’s service-connected disability status and financial need may be considered when it comes to fees at these VA Community Living Centers.\n\nVeteran dependents and surviving family members typically can’t access home health care services through VA Community Living Centers. However, seniors may be able to use other VA benefits to pay for long-term home health care in the setting of their choice, like at home or in a private assisted living, independent living, or memory care community.\n\nVA State Home Per Diem Program\n\nEligible veterans may be able to reside in a State Veterans Home, a state-operated senior living community designed for military-connected individuals. Veterans who choose to reside in these communities may be able to receive support for their care through the VA State Home Per Diem Program.\n\nWhile individual situations may vary, the VA generally pays a per diem rate for qualified veterans to reside in State Veterans Homes. However, other fees or expenses may still exist.\n\nSome State Veterans Homes may admit non-veteran spouses or Gold Star parents, which are parents of a fallen service member. However, the VA State Home Per Diem Program typically doesn’t pay for the long-term care of non-veterans at these communities.\n\nBack to top\n\nVA benefit payment amounts\n\nIt’s exceptionally challenging to calculate an exact amount that a veteran, veteran dependent, or family member may receive from the VA for long-term care. Award amounts may vary based on where the veteran, survivor, or dependent lands with the following:\n\nDisability rating\n\nUnique health needs\n\nAssistance required for activities of daily living\n\nNumber of dependents\n\nIf the veteran is married to another veteran, also known as a dual-veteran couple or dual-military couple\n\nThe specific programs and benefits the veteran participates in\n\nHowever, we can look at general rates for the following programs. Keep in mind that a variety of factors determine the actual payment your loved one may receive. As mentioned previously, MAPR refers to the Maximum Annual Pension Rate allowed for a specific year.\n\nPension rates for veterans\n\nFor each additional dependent, add an annual benefit of $2,743 with a monthly rate of $228 to your loved one’s MAPR amount.\n\nPension rates for spouses\n\nFor each additional dependent, add an annual benefit of $2,743 with a monthly rate of $228 to your love one’s MAPR amount.\n\nVA disability compensation rates\n\nDisability ratingMonthly payment, veteran alone10%$165.9220%$327.9930%$508.0540%$731.8650%$1,041.8260%$1,319.6570%$1,663.0680%$1,933.1590%$2,172.39100%$3,621.95\n\nVA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) rate\n\nThe DIC program follows a complex set to determine overall payment amount. Payments vary based on individual circumstance. For example, if you’re a surviving spouse of a veteran who dies on or after January 1, 1993, you could be eligible $1,612.75 per month. There may be additional amounts added on if a surviving spouse has a disability or children under the age of 18.\n\nHow are VA benefits for senior care paid?\n\nVA benefits are deposited directly to the bank account of the veteran or surviving spouse each month. If your loved one doesn’t have a bank account but wishes to receive their payment through direct deposit, there are veteran-friendly banks and credit unions that can help them qualify for an account or get one set up.\n\nBack to top\n\nVA long-term care benefits: Coverage by type\n\nWhile the VA benefits and programs vary, eligible veterans, dependents, and surviving family members may receive support to help with long-term care expenses related to the following:\n\nAssisted living\n\nIndependent living\n\nIn-home care\n\nFamily caregiving\n\nSkilled nursing care\n\nNursing home options\n\nMemory care\n\nFor more personalized support, advice, and explanation of senior care options, reach out to A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors.\n\nVeterans benefits for assisted living\n\nAssisted living facilities provide long-term housing and care for seniors. Older adults in assisted living are generally active but may need help with certain activities, such as bathing or dressing, throughout the day. Assisted living facilities also offer nutritious meals, housekeeping, and social activities in a senior-friendly environment.\n\nAssisted living costs vary based on the facility location, amenities, size of apartment, and level of care needed. However, the median monthly cost of assisted living in the U.S. is about $4,807, according to A Place for Mom’s 2023 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\n\nIf your family member qualifies for the Aid and Attendance benefits, they may receive a supplemental monthly amount to offset the cost of care at an assisted living facility, as long as care at the facility includes help with activities of daily living.\n\nVeterans benefits for memory care\n\nMemory care, sometimes called Alzheimer’s care, is for seniors who have Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. These residential facilities cater to the unique needs of seniors with memory loss. The Aid and Attendance may be an important benefit to help those eligible pay for care in one of these communities.\n\nMemory care facilities are distinct form of assisted living and provide a safe environment for those suffering with memory loss. On-site services include prepared meals, medication management, personal care, occupational therapy, music therapy, and other memory-enhancing activities and therapies.\n\nHere are a few more features of memory care communities:\n\nFacilities are often designed to reduce confusion and prevent wandering.\n\nMemory care staff members are trained in specialized memory care techniques and provide 24-hour supervision with a focus on improving the quality of life of residents.\n\nMost memory care communities offer person-centered dementia care.\n\nThe median cost of memory care is $5,995 per month, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners. However, this may vary based on facility location, amenities, and the level of care provided.\n\nVeterans benefits for nursing home care\n\nNursing home care is for seniors who are seriously ill or have a severe health condition, or for those recovering from an illness or injury after a hospital stay. Veteran residents of a nursing home facility may qualify for the Aid and Attendance financial assistance.\n\nNursing homes provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for elderly adults who need a high level of nursing and medical care but don’t need to be in a hospital. In addition to meals, housekeeping, and social activities, nursing home care can include the following:\n\nSkilled nursing care\n\n24/7 medical oversight\n\nMedical equipment and supplies\n\nPersonal care\n\nMedication management\n\nRehabilitation programs and therapies\n\nPalliative and hospice care\n\nNursing home costs vary based on location and level of care provided. However, the median monthly cost of nursing home care in the U.S. is about $7,908 for a semi-private room and $9,034 for a private room, according to Genworth’s 2021 Cost of Care Survey. A more recent survey has yet to be released by Genworth, but it’s likely that prices will continue to raise with increasing inflation and demand in the U.S.\n\nYou may wonder if veterans, veteran spouses, and surviving spouses get free nursing home care through the VA. Unfortunately, veterans benefits usually don’t provide free nursing home care. However, Community Living Centers and State Veterans Home can be affordable options for veterans and other eligible military-connected people.\n\nVeterans benefits for home care\n\nHome care provides nonmedical care for seniors who wish to age at home. In-home caregivers are trained in senior care and provide a wide range of services that cater to individual needs. Home care services may include personal care, companionship, cooking, light housekeeping, mobility assistance, and more. Senior veterans or dependents may be eligible for Aid and Attendance supplemental income, if they receive home care help with activities of daily living, such as bathing or dressing.\n\nThe cost of home care varies greatly, because it’s based on the type of care needed and how often it’s provided. However, in-home care is typically $30 per hour, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners.\n\nVeterans benefits for independent living\n\nIndependent living facilities are for older adults who are generally healthy, active, and able to live on their own. These communities offer a carefree lifestyle for older adults who want convenience and a social lifestyle, free of the responsibilities of home ownership. Independent living services often include prepared meals, housekeeping, complimentary transportation, and social activities.\n\nTypically, independent living facilities don’t provide assistance with activities of daily living, which is one of the requirements for Aid and Attendance eligibility. However, as seniors age, their health may decline and their care needs may change. Some independent living residents may eventually use home care services for help with personal care, and they may qualify for the Aid and Attendance at some point to help offset their monthly costs of living and care.\n\nLike with other senior care types, independent living costs vary based on location, amenities, and accommodations. The monthly median cost of rent at an independent living facility in the U.S. is $3,000, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners.\n\nVeterans benefits to pay family caregivers\n\nVeterans or dependents who qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits may be able to deduct the fees paid to a non-licensed in-home caregiver from their income. This means your loved one may deduct expenses related to paying a friend or family member other than their spouse to help with at least two activities of daily living.\n\nHowever, it isn’t possible to use Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits to pay a spouse for care. This is because when an eligible veteran applies for veterans benefits, a spouse’s income is included in the household income, so care provided by a spouse isn’t considered a deductible expense.\n\nBack to top\n\nGather documentation to apply for VA benefits\n\nYou or your loved one may need to gather some information and documents, including:\n\nThe veteran’s Social Security number or VA file number\n\nMilitary history information\n\nFinancial information for the veteran, veteran dependents, or surviving family members\n\nBank account direct deposit information\n\nThe veteran’s original discharge papers (DD214)\n\nMarriage certificate, typically for surviving spouses only\n\nPeople under the age of 65 may also need:\n\nWork history information\n\nMedical information\n\nContact the VA to begin an application\n\nYour loved one may need to reach out to the VA directly if they wish to apply for VA benefits and programs. They can reach the VA through the following ways:\n\nCall 800-698-2411 (Anyone utilizing TTY can reach the VA at 711.)\n\nUse the Ask VA online tool\n\nSend questions to the VA chatbot, a virtual assistant agent\n\nVisit a local VA location\n\nContact support organizations for application assistance\n\nIf you want additional assistance applying for VA benefits outside of direct VA support, you may want to consider the following options for benefits counseling and advocacy:\n\nVeteran service organizations, or VSOs, offer free, basic guidance on the application process and can answer simple questions about available benefits and the application process. VSO volunteers often offer assistance across the country at American Legion halls and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) lodges.\n\nVeterans organizations, such as VFW, American Legion, and DAV, may also answer questions about benefits and help you prepare your application free of charge. Some organizations can even provide legal advocacy and help families appeal denied claims.\n\nAccredited VA consultants can also help families assess eligibility for VA long-term care benefits and help with financial planning as you prepare your loved one’s application. Accredited VA consultants offer paid assistance to families whose benefit application has been denied. Like other VA benefit counselors, these consultants can help determine why an application was denied and help make any changes to increase the chances of approval upon resubmission. It’s important to know that regulations prohibit consultants from charging families for help with an initial claim that hasn’t been denied.\n\nElder law attorneys can help families with financial planning and the VA benefits application process. When you’re seeking advice, it’s important to look for a reputable attorney who has experience with VA benefits. You can search for an elder law attorney by location through the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys directory.\n\nYou may also choose to get expert advice from Patriot Angels (1-833-879-6017), A Place for Mom’s trusted, VA-accredited partner.\n\nNote: A Place for Mom may be compensated if you choose to use Patriot Angels’ services. We clearly disclose financial relationships around featured products or services.\n\nBack to top\n\nVA application and approval process length\n\nThe application process for veterans benefits can be slow. You or your loved one will probably need to fill out several forms, and it may take some time to gather all the information and documents your loved one needs to complete their application.\n\nThe approval process for VA benefits may also take several months. Make sure to be thorough when completing your application so that it can be processed as quickly as possible. Eligible veterans and surviving spouses who are age 90 or older may request an expedited review in a cover letter with their application.\n\nRetroactive VA benefits\n\nWhile the application process may take several months, veterans benefits are paid retroactively once approved. This means the first benefit payment includes a lump sum to cover the months where the application was pending. Speak to a VA representative to learn how to establish a date for retroactive payments.\n\nBack to top\n\nVA long-term care benefits with Medicare\n\nIf your loved one qualifies for both Medicare and VA benefits, they may enroll in both programs. However, unlike veterans benefits for senior care, Medicare doesn’t cover the cost of home care or expenses related to care at senior living facilities. Medicare only pays for short-term care at approved nursing home facilities for individuals needing rehabilitation after an illness or injury that required hospitalization. In some cases, Medicare may also cover in-home rehabilitation services and therapies.\n\nShort-term care expenses covered by Original Medicare at a Medicare-contracted nursing facility include:\n\n100% of the first 20 days in a skilled nursing facility, after a three-night minimum inpatient hospitalization\n\nA portion of days 21-100 in a skilled nursing facility with a coinsurance of up to $200 per day\n\nShort-term rehabilitation care after a hospitalization\n\nBack to top\n\nVA long-term care benefits with Medicaid may cover the cost of senior care\n\nBoth the VA and Medicaid offer long-term care benefits. The VA Aid and Attendance benefit may be used to help pay for home care, assisted living, or nursing home costs. Medicaid typically only covers the cost of long-term care at nursing homes. In some cases, Medicaid may cover home care costs or community-based services for eligible beneficiaries, if they’d require nursing home care without such services. Knowing the type of care your loved one needs, plus eligibility requirements for VA benefits and Medicaid, will help you determine whether to apply for financial assistance for senior care from one program over the other.\n\nIf your loved one is a veteran who is eligible for VA benefits for long-term care, they may also be eligible for Medicaid. For example, let’s say your family member qualifies for Aid and Attendance, but the amount their benefit pays isn’t enough to cover long-term care costs. In that case, Medicaid may cover the rest of the cost of nursing home care, if your family member qualifies financially.\n\nHowever, Medicaid programs vary from state to state. For this reason, it may be a good idea to seek advice from an elder law attorney if you’re planning to apply for both VA benefits and Medicaid.\n\nBack to top\n\nVA burial benefits: A final salute\n\nVeterans who receive an honorable or general discharge may be buried in a national cemetery or a state veterans cemetery where the veteran lived at the time of death, as long as a gravesite is available.\n\nThere’s no cost to the veteran’s family for the gravesite or a headstone or marker. Spouses and dependents of veterans may also be buried in a national cemetery with the veteran. The VA will pay to have the spouse’s or dependent’s name and date of birth inscribed on the veteran’s headstone.\n\nFor veterans buried in a private cemetery, the VA provides a government headstone or marker and a burial flag at no cost to the veteran’s family. However, costs related to the headstone placement are not paid by the VA.\n\nThe VA also provides financial assistance to reimburse families of veterans for funeral and burial services. To qualify for these benefits, the deceased veteran must meet certain requirements. The amount reimbursed depends on several factors, including whether the cause of death was service-related.\n\nService-related deaths. The VA will pay up to $2,000 for burial expenses. Some or all of the transportation costs to a VA national cemetery may also be reimbursed, if that’s where the veteran will be buried.\n\nNon-service-related deaths. The amounts paid vary based on date of death and whether the veteran dies at a VA hospital. However, burial and funeral expenses, as well as the cost of a burial plot, may be reimbursed.\n\nPeople who may be qualified for the VA burial benefit\n\nIf you’re a family member of a veteran who paid for funeral or burial costs, you may be reimbursed for these costs, as long as the veteran received an honorable or general discharge and at least one of these other requirements are met:\n\nThe veteran died because of a service-related disability.\n\nThe veteran was receiving VA pension or other compensation at the time of death, or had started the application process to receive these benefits and was found entitled to them.\n\nThe veteran died at a VA hospital or while receiving care at another hospital under VA contract.\n\nThe veteran died while traveling for care, treatment, or examination authorized and paid by the VA.\n\nThe veteran died at a VA-approved state nursing home on or after October 9, 1996.\n\nApply for VA burial benefits\n\nYou will need to gather a few documents to apply for VA burial and funeral allowance benefits, including:\n\nA death certificate\n\nThe veteran’s discharge documents\n\nReceipts for payments you’ve made related to the funeral or burial services and burial plot\n\nNext, you can submit your application for VA burial on the VA website. You can also mail your application to the Pension Management Center that serves your state, work with an accredited VA representative to start the application process, or go to a local regional benefit office to turn in your application form in person.\n\nBack to top",
      "# [Independent Living Facilities in Maryland](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/maryland)\nThe state of Maryland falls in the middle of the country’s Northeast, Southern, and Midwestern regions, and its culture combines elements of them all. This is part of why Maryland earned the nickname “America in Miniature.” With the Appalachian Mountains passing through the far western part of the state, and the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic coastlines in the east, Maryland’s geographical features give residents plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities — even in a small state. Annapolis and Baltimore are also home to many historic Colonial sites, and Washington, D.C. sits on Maryland’s southern border. Maryland is a transition state in several ways, which helps make it an attractive retirement destination.\n\nCurrently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 100 independent living communities in Maryland.\n\nThe median monthly cost of independent living in Maryland is about $3,600.\n\nIndependent living communities in Maryland don’t have to be licensed and aren’t regulated by a state agency, but they must adhere to local housing laws. They are treated as regular rental properties, but have age restrictions in place and offer senior-focused amenities.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for independent living communities to share a campus with other senior living facilities, like assisted living or memory care, which provide higher levels of care. The state does license and regulate these communities, meaning they must follow Maryland assisted living regulations.\n\nStand-alone independent living communities must follow the same rules and standards as any other rental property in Maryland. A lease for a term of one year or less is valid whether it is written or oral. However, anything lasting longer must be in writing and signed by the lease’s creator to be valid. A landlord’s responsibilities to renters include:[01]\n\nProviding renters with a residence that complies with the state’s health and safety regulations\n\nProviding access to heat, light, electricity, hot/cold running water, and adequate sewage disposal\n\nRepairing the property within a “reasonable time,” which cannot exceed 30 days after receiving notice from a tenant\n\nComplying with laws governing security deposits and eviction procedures\n\nNotifying a tenant if they plan to raise rent and only raising rent upon lease renewal\n\nLikewise, tenants have responsibilities to uphold while renting a property. They must:\n\nPay rent on time\n\nReport damage or needed repairs\n\nReturn possession of the property to the owner at the agreed upon time\n\nReturn the property in the same condition as when they moved in, minus ordinary wear and tear\n\nBesides the above, certain towns, cities, or counties may have other tenant responsibilities. For example, Montgomery County requires tenants to have a landlord’s written approval before keeping a pet on the premises.\n\nProtections against discrimination\n\nCourts state that Maryland’s law is “substantially equivalent” to federal law preventing housing discrimination. Homeowners cannot discriminate due to race, color, religion, family status, national origin, disability, and source of income, as well as gender identification, marital status, and sexual orientation.\n\nFederal nondiscrimination laws like the Fair Housing Act, Section 504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also protect tenants from discrimination due to disability. These laws require landlords to provide reasonable accommodations and modifications to those with disabilities so they can enjoy and use a dwelling. Examples include exceptions to a “no pets” policy for service animals and a reserved parking place for someone with a mobility impairment.[02]\n\nHow to find independent living community inspection reports in Maryland\n\nThough stand-alone independent living communities don’t undergo inspection reports, some apartment-based reports and inspections may take place. Residential rental properties built before 1978 are required to register in the lead rental registry and renew it annually with the Maryland Department of the Environment. Residential rental properties built after 1977 and properties that have a passing Lead-Free inspection certificate are exempt. You can search the lead rental registry online to confirm a property’s compliance.\n\nAdditionally, certain cities and counties may have their own rental regulations. For instance, Baltimore city rental units must be registered, inspected, and licensed by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). The inspection requirements are publicly available to view, while those with inquiries can contact the DHCD by email at S8Landlord@habc.org or HCVInspections@habc.org.\n\nIndependent living options on a larger campus with other care options like assisted living or memory care may have other requirements. Generally, only the portions of a larger campus offering care must adhere to the relevant regulations.\n\nAssisted living facilities with 10 or more beds require their own regular reports and inspections. This includes an unannounced health and fire safety inspection every one to two years, as well as annually collecting mandatory influenza vaccination policies and vaccination rates of assisted living staff. These reports are available online through the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC).[03]\n\nMaryland Department of Health contact information\n\nMaryland Department of Health\n\n201 W.

      "# [Independent Living Facilities in Maine](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/maine)\nMaine is nicknamed “The Pine Tree State” after the white pine forests which cover its landscape. Maine has over 17 million acres of forest and more than 3,470 miles of coastline on the mainland – 5,000 miles total if you include all of its islands. With more coastline than California, it’s no surprise that Maine is famous for seafood. Over 90% of the country’s lobster is harvested in Maine, and much of the state’s culture is influenced by the fishing industry. Locals love to celebrate Maine’s seafaring and fishing heritage, especially at events like the annual Maine Lobster Festival. Maine’s awe-inspiring natural beauty and the rustic charm of cities like Portland and Augusta make Maine an excellent retirement destination.\n\nCurrently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 15 retirement communities in Maine that offer independent living. The median monthly cost of independent living in Maine is about $2,900.\n\nMaine doesn’t have specific regulations or licensing requirements for independent living communities. However, the state’s tenant rights guidelines apply to any rental agreement a senior may enter into with an independent living facility.\n\nWhile there are several stand-alone independent living facilities in Maine, some share a campus with assisted living communities, which are subject to state licensing and regulatory requirements. To understand assisted living regulations in Maine, review our Overview of Assisted Living in Maine.\n\nThe information contained on this page is for informational purposes only and is not intended to constitute medical, legal or financial advice or create a professional relationship between A Place for Mom and the reader.

      "# [Independent Living Facilities in Massachusetts](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/massachusetts)\nIndependent living facilities in Massachusetts don’t provide any care services to seniors, therefore they don’t need to be licensed by a state facility. Instead, they are treated as standard rentals and must follow Massachusetts rental laws outlined by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC). These communities typically have a minimum age requirement, which is typically 62 years.\n\nRegulations for independent living on a senior care campus\n\nIn Massachusetts, if an independent living facility shares a campus with an assisted living or memory care facility, then those senior care units must be licensed. To learn more about the senior care licensing process and facility regulations, check out the Massachusetts assisted living regulations and memory care regulations.\n\nMassachusetts doesn’t offer inspection reports online, but you can request a copy of an assisted living or memory care facility by contacting the Executive Office of Elder Affairs at information.resources@mass.gov or fax them at 617-727-9368.\n\nStand-alone independent living facility requirements\n\nLike any Massachusetts rental, stand-alone independent living facilities must offer senior residents a safe and habitable living environment. Independent living rentals in Massachusetts must adhere to the following requirements:[01]\n\nProvide residents basic services — like maintenance, fully functioning utilities, and stable structural elements.\n\nMaintain a safe and healthy environment free of cockroaches and rodents.\n\nOffer equal housing opportunities, therefore they cannot refuse to rent to someone with a disability.\n\nTenant rights in Massachusetts\n\nIf an independent living landlord in Massachusetts fails to provide a safe and habitable environment, tenants have rights to remedies available to them. Some of the most important tenant rights to note include:[01]\n\nTenants can deduct up to four months of future rent to cover repair costs if a landlord fails to start or contract for repairs within five days of notice. And, if the landlord fails to complete repairs that impact a resident’s health or safety within two weeks.\n\nTenants may withhold a portion of rent if the landlord fails to provide habitable conditions.\n\nBefore withholding rent or proceeding with repairs, tenants should get legal advice because it could breach their lease agreement. The Mass.gov website offers several legal services to help tenants in such situations.\n\nIf you would like to report a complaint or need help resolving a housing dispute, you can contact the Attorney General’s Consumer Hotline at 617-727-8400.\n\nFair housing laws for seniors with disabilities\n\nFair housing laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities and require landlords to offer reasonable accommodations and modifications.[02] Therefore, an independent living facility in Massachusetts cannot refuse to rent due to a senior’s disability.\n\nA reasonable accommodation is a change to policy that will allow a person with a disability to use common areas. Some examples that could help an individual with a disability include:[02]\n\nAssigning a closer parking space\n\nAllowing a service animal regardless of pet policies\n\nRelocating the trash to be more accessible on a ground floor\n\nA reasonable modification is a structural change that is made to existing premises. Some modifications that could help a senior with a disability include:[02]\n\nInstalling a visual fire alarm for a deaf resident\n\nAdding a ramp to a building entrance\n\nInstalling grab bars in a resident’s bathroom\n\nIndependent living facility providers must cover the cost of accommodations or modifications as long as they don’t result in an undue financial and administrative burden, or a fundamental alteration.[02]\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health contact information",

      "# [Assisted Living In Washington](https://www.aplaceformom.com/assisted-living/washington)\nIn Washington, assisted living facilities provide care to seven or more people within a community-like setting. These facilities provide room and board, assistance with daily activities, and limited nursing services. On average, the cost of assisted living in Washington is $5,500 per month, or $66,000 annually, according to A Place for Mom’s internal data. Assisted living is the second most affordable senior living option in Washington, right behind independent living.\n\nAssisted living costs greatly vary in Washington and often depend on factors like location, floor plan, care needs, and amenities. However, the approximate monthly cost of assisted living ranges from $3,500 to $7,800, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data.[01] This cost range is an estimate based on what referred families actually paid at our partnering assisted living facilities in Washington. Costs account for room and board, care, and access to on-site amenities.\n\nThe average cost of assisted living in Washington is close to the national average, but it’s slightly higher by a few hundred dollars. Some Washington assisted living communities have higher prices because they’re located in popular areas, offer more on-site health care services, and feature robust lifestyle programs. However, there are more affordable options in less popular areas that still offer a healthy balance of care services and amenities. Seniors and their families can also save on some care costs with programs like Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nSeniors and their families often pull together several income sources to cover assisted living costs in Washington. Families who start planning early tend to have the most options because it gives them more time to research the most suitable options. Most families use some combination of private and public resources to pay for assisted living. In this section, we’ve highlighted potential options and resources.

      "# [Assisted Living In Kentucky](https://www.aplaceformom.com/assisted-living/kentucky)\nAssisted living in Kentucky provides long-term residential living in a community setting, with care services tailored to seniors’ individual needs. Assisted living communities offer a variety of activities for seniors, but also provide support with activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, and eating. The median cost of assisted living in Kentucky is $4,100 per month or $49,200 annually, according to A Place for Mom’s internal data on our partner assisted living communities in Kentucky.[01]\n\nWhile the Bluegrass State is known for its annual derby, horse racing isn’t the only thing Kentucky has going for it. The state’s Appalachian region is teeming with natural beauty, music, and several historical sites. Cities offer a homey feel with plenty of Southern hospitality, and for those who like the taste of a fine bourbon, Kentucky is home to several well-known distilleries.\n\nThe median cost of assisted living in Kentucky can range from approximately $2,700 to $6,300 per month, which is lower than the national median. This range is based on A Place for Mom’s internal data and reflects what referred families actually paid at partnering assisted living facilities in Kentucky.\n\nThere are several factors that affect costs, including location, services, and amenities offered, as well as the specific care needs of each senior. Communities located near larger cities like Louisville or Lexington are likely to be more expensive. Luxury amenities can affect price, as well as specialized services and programming, such as chef-prepared meals, concierge desk, or on-site educational classes.\n\nOther factors that can affect the cost of assisted living may include the following:\n\nRoom size and design\n\nAdmission fees\n\nPet fees\n\nFamilies typically pay out of pocket for assisted living room and board fees. However, to reduce the costs of medically necessary care, many families look into Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance, or veteran’s benefits.\n\nIt’s common for families to blend a variety of payment methods to pay for assisted living in Kentucky. Keep in mind that, even with a variety of options for payment, early planning often provides families with the widest range of options. The following section has information on private pay, public and private insurance options, and veteran’s benefits. For a more detailed overview, you can also visit our complete guide to paying for long-term care.\n\nEase of access to Kentucky assisted living records\n\nWe developed a system to rate each state on how easy — or difficult — it is to find important assisted living records and reports, and compiled tips to help you in your search.\n\nStates with the most transparent records allow you to look up important information about each assisted living facility online, including inspections, complaints, survey results, violations, capacity, and whether the facility accepts Medicaid.\n\nAccess to Kentucky assisted living records: Basic\n\nPublic access to assisted living records and reports for the state of Kentucky is basic.

This place is heaven compared to other surrounding places. Thank you.\n\nReview for Encore at Bolingbrook\n\nI'm pleased with my Mom's care. Every person I have had the pleasure of working with concerning my Mom have been supportive, loving and caring. Encore is a smaller facility. I chose this home rather than one of the larger ones because I value family. My Mom knows all the staff and residents. She is in great hands. Every time I visit, the residents are involved in a variety of activities. Often there is a visit by someone of interest. Example... a lovely man brought his Cello and played for the residents. My Mom played the cello in High School. She was all smiles!!! Mom was an avid gardener. Her home garden was actually part of a garden tour. I have taken her out to pick out plants. A couple of the other residents helped plant the flowers. Of course her dementia has become worse so the involvement has lessened. She's in a very caring home.\n\nWonderful staff\n\nFacility is bright and cheery. Staff go above and beyond. My Mom receives attentive care and she loves living there. She says she feels very safe knowing that someone will help her immediately if necessary. Could not have found a better place locally for her care.\n\nFriendly Community\n\nOur loved one did not participate much in the activities and we gave the value for cost a 4 only because I think most everything is overpriced, but it also was brand new. my Mom was there for 2 weeks and ended up have mini strokes and passed a way 2 weeks later. But for the 2 weeks she was there, she was the happiest we had seen her in quite a while. Over all we really liked the place and I recommend it to often to people who are on the fence of where to go and what to do. Mom really liked the staff there and was enjoying making new friends for the short time she was able to.\n\nExactly what we were looking for\n\nWe love that everything is included. Definitely feels safe and well-cared for. My mother-in-law can be very particular...but she's been happy there. Lots of activities to do if she chooses. She's in a studio, so we were a little worried it would be too small for her. But it works great for her, fits her needs well.\n\nAmazing caretakers and facility\n\nThis has been a perfect fit for my mother. Everyone is so kind and caring. It is a perfect size and not too far of a walk to the dining area even from the furthest room. Always clean and fresh. Great communication\n\nA Place For Dad\n\nMy Dad has been at Encore at Maplewood for 3 months. He just loves having his own apartment. It’s wonderful that he doesn’t have to worry about taking his medication, doing his laundry or cleaning his apartment! The staff at Encore takes care of these needs and so much more. He enjoys the delicious meals served in the homey dining room. He looks forward to the daily activities and friendships that he is continuing to make with the residents. I am so pleased with the better quality of life Encore has given my Dad. Visiting Dad is a treat since he is living in his forever home."

As the largest senior living referral information service in the United States, A Place for Mom has guided thousands of families through the process of finding senior care.  Using its nationwide network of more than 18,000 providers of senior living services, the company helps families find care and housing options that meet their needs and empowers them to make informed decisions. \n\nWorking under the principle of delivering individualized, local, expert guidance to families seeking senior care opportunities, A Place for Mom was launched in the summer of 2000. The company was founded by three professionals, including a former senior housing executive with more than 15 years of experience. Receiving more than 60,000 inquiries from family members per month, A Place for Mom has been named one of the fastest-growing firms in the United States.\n\nOne-on-one, comprehensive guidance is provided by A Place for Mom staff, helping families explore elder care and senior housing choices, including assisted living, nursing homes, retirement communities, memory care, and respite and residential home care. In addition, A Place for Mom works to connect families with facilities serving individuals who have been diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. A Place for Mom is paid by its participating communities and care providers, therefore the service is offered at no charge to families.\n\n- [Website](http://www.aplaceformom.com)\n- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/a-place-for-mom)\n- [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aplaceformom)\n\n## Funding (184M USD total)\n\n- 175M USD on 2022-01-24\n- 9M USD on 2006-01-01\n\n## News\n\n- A Place for Mom 2024 State of Caregiving Report Reveals Rising Caregiving Crisis for Families Caring for Aging Parents in America ([Business Wire, 2024-10-31](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241031404833/en/A-Place-for-Mom-2024-State-of-Caregiving-Report-Reveals-Rising-Caregiving-Crisis-for-Families-Caring-for-Aging-Parents-in-America))\n- A Place for Mom 2024 State of Caregiving Report Reveals Rising Caregiving Crisis for Families Caring for Aging Parents in America ([Morningstar, Inc., 2024-10-31](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20241031404833/a-place-for-mom-2024-state-of-caregiving-report-reveals-rising-caregiving-crisis-for-families-caring-for-aging-parents-in-america))\n- ‘Free’ For-Profit Senior Services Referrals: Buyer Beware ([Forbes, 2024-07-01](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/07/03/free-for-profit-senior-services-referrals-buyer-beware/))\n- Popular assisted living referral 'A Place for Mom' glosses over neglect - The Washington Post ([Washington Post, 2024-05-29](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/16/place-for-mom-assisted-living-referral/))\n- A Place for Mom launches national online directory of more than 15,000 SNFs ([McKnight's Senior Living, 2024-05-28](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/a-place-for-mom-launches-national-online-directory-of-more-than-15000-snfs/))\n- Popular assisted living referral ‘A Place for Mom’ glosses over neglect ([The Washington Post, 2024-05-16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/16/place-for-mom-assisted-living-referral/))\n- Senior-care referral site ‘A Place for Mom’ stays mum on neglect ([The Washington Post, 2024-05-16](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/16/place-for-mom-assisted-living-referral/))\n- Popular assisted living referral 'A Place for Mom' glosses over neglect - The Washington Post ([Washington Post, 2024-05-14](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/16/place-for-mom-assisted-living-referral/))\n- Tatyana Zlotsky to Become Chief Executive Officer of A Place for Mom ([Business Wire, 2024-05-04](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240415134626/en/Tatyana-Zlotsky-to-Become-Chief-Executive-Officer-of-A-Place-for-Mom))\n- Tatyana Zlotsky to Become Chief Executive Officer of A Place for Mom ([Business Wire, 2024-05-04](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240415134626/en/Tatyana-Zlotsky-to-Become-Chief-Executive-Officer-of-A-Place-for-Mom))\n\n",

I did so about six months whole I was just looking to gather information about resources in my area. This company immediately began giving my contact info to every assisted living facility in the region, regardless of whether it was a good fit for my parent or not, and my phone has been ringing off the hook with cold calls ever since. A Place For Mom itself also continues to contact me and harass me, and has ignored all the messages I've sent then asking for it to cease. They've also lied to the Better Business Bureau about taking my name off their list on order to resolve the complaint I made against them for the harassment.\n\nMy aunt had a similar experience with them when looking for a place for my grandpa. She still continues to get calls and emails now years later after my grandpa has passed away. \n\nThere are aging consultant services you can pay for who won't do this sort of thing to you.\n\n## Comment ID k794u0n with +31 score by [(too-much-noise, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k794u0n/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nThanks for the warning!

I also called around on my own, but they were very helpful in finding places that actually took insurance vs. totally self-pay.  Half of the places I called on my own didn’t even return my call until days or weeks later, and I needed help ASAP because he needed overnight care.  I was really pleased with the service they provided and haven’t had any issues thereafter, so not convinced that they are in the same category as A Place For Mom.\n\n### Comment ID k7bqjqt with +2 score by [(atxJohnR, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7bqjqt/) (in reply to ID k798z98):\nThey generally charge the place people move into an average of $3500. That $3500 could have been your move in incentive. Nothing is free, and this company is the worst\n\nEdit, APFM Fees range from market to market. The fees are either flat (like $3500), or equivalent to whatever a half, or full month's rent (and care) are for the apartment chosen and care plan monthly rate.\n\n#### Comment ID k7clkhn with +2 score by [(VirginiaUSA1964, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7clkhn/) (in reply to ID k7bqjqt):\nThat's about right.

If you’re on reddit, you probably don’t need them! Mostly for folks who aren’t good at googling or discovering places nearby. It’s a referral service, so APFM gets commission if someone moves in to a place they recommended. We were told to keep calling until the parent moves. Even if you’re years off from needing a place, they will call and call and call.\n\n### Comment ID kpfrlxy with +5 score by [(bonniebelle8, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/kpfrlxy/) (in reply to ID k79jf8q):\nI worked for APFM too.

I got a recommendation for them when I first got on this board.  They give you limited lists of places then harass you after every visit to see if you're going with them.  The places that use them, usually terribly overpriced, will give them a months rent for referral and not give a break to you.   I told my rep repeatedly I was no longer interested.

Especially when more and more emergencies happen (because that’s what happens.)\n\nThe continuum of care means that it’s available when they need it (because that’s what happens) and it’s way better for them to be in the same place so that it’s not as foreign to them. Their friends can still visit and sometimes the facility will discount their room if they ever need to go to the nursing section for rehab. \n\nDon’t use A Place for Mom, just pull up your location on google maps and do a search for facilities near you.

Many places increase the monthly fee as the resident’s needs increase.  I would look for a place associated with a non profit.  Don’t be impressed by the decor in the lobby.

A hospital social worker put them in contact with me when I was looking into whether or not there were any facilities that could take my dad with multiple forms of dementia. (the social worker was of no help at all with anything concerning my dad)  I had no idea that was actually who they were sending me to until a Senior Living Consultant from there contacted me. She of course recommended the communities that advertised with them and they were extremely expensive and all private pay. That part of the conversation was a waste of time and I let her know that we couldn't afford anything she was mentioning.  \n\n\nBut the lady I spoke with used to be a social worker and she was able to give me lots of other information about how to apply for certain benefits etc. My dad was in the service so she sent me links to things that could possibly help with veterans. She sent me a lot of other helpful links too about how to apply for medicaid etc. I realize all of that information is online but I was in a crisis situation and totally overwhelmed with trying to figure out what to do. Ultimately the information and resources she provided me with didn't turn out to be helpful for us but she was very kind and it was a good starting point to get some conversations going with my mother. We ultimately got help way past the crisis point by a social worker once my dad started getting services from hospice.  \n\n\nBasically the service itself wasn't helpful but I talked to a really nice lady that helped me in a really bad time!",

I immediately hung up realizing the tech guy had text me his direct phone number and they called me back 7-8 times within an hour. I finally answered and inquired on why they were so relentless and was told that they just want to\nhelp people..  that is overkill and the relentless contact is ruining our reputation.. \n\nI worked in senior living prior to working for a place for mom and the experience in a community setting (skilled nursing and assisted living) makes me have a better understanding of the importance of having a good community that fits someone’s care needs but also their personality. Most of the families I work with do move into the communities I recommend because I put the work in to make sure I am sending them to places they can afford and I know are great places… HOWEVER, most advisors have no prior experience in senior living… most of the new people are sales backgrounds and while my job is technically sales, I don’t like looking at it that way. \n\nHow it works is APFM is paid a referral fee by our community partners. Those communities sign a contract with us and agree to pay a referral fee if a resident we refer moves in, usually the equivalent of one month’s rent. Also, this is how we are free to families. \n\nI’m sorry to hear of all of the negative experiences people have.

Some things I wish I knew about the AL/MC referral system. \n\n- The whole system revolves around referral fees (ie, A Place for Mom is free but they're going to get the community fee you pay or a portion of rent). I talked to a lot of places out of our budget and many folks were like \"Okay. Can I connect you to someone who can help?\". \n- The system so much runs this way that some places you can't even get a hold of without a referral (basically the number listed online will get you no one but A Place for Mom can get you a tour)\n- You loose negotiating power by using referral companies, like if you can connect with a memory care without them you may be able to have your community fee cut in half or even totally dropped. \n- You'll be more likely to get in touch with less corporate feeling, family run places. Some of those I called the number online and got someone pretty quickly.\n- With all this, I'd recommend trying to call some places near you, or trying to drop by, if you can, before dealing with A Place for Mom. I also found a more regional guy who I definitely preferred dealing with to A Place for Mom. APFM know nothing about the places they're recommending beyond cost, and typically know nothing about your area. They still email me to this day, and if my mom ever needs a place I will not be dealing with them again. \n- I hate it so much. I just want to look online and find information and they make it so much more difficult to do that than it should be.\n\n### Comment ID l38ai1u with +2 score by [(meetmypuka, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l38ai1u/) (in reply to ID l374qul):\nHear hear!\n\n### Comment ID l3jpbqs with +2 score by [(Glad_Map_520, Reddit, 2024-05-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l3jpbqs/) (in reply to ID l374qul):\nI totally understand your POV on all points. \n\nHowever, communities are not allowed by contract to change their fees for APFM referrals.. not saying it doesn’t happen but if it were to, they could get in big trouble for it.. if APFM caught wind of that, I promise they would take action.. that is one thing they will not stand for. \n\nAlso, if you get the right advisor, they will negotiate fees on your behalf. I work for APFM and get community fees waived for my families all the time. I just want my families I work with to find the right fit.. at the end of the day I do have a quota to meet, but I find that I can manage to meet that quota by providing a useful service to the families I work with and help them find a place that fits them well-financially and personality wise.. I definitely hope APFM will take the feedback we get from families and make changes.. we just got a new CEO and she is actually a great person.

I'm not at all saying all the workers at APFM are bad people or even bad at their jobs. I don't however recommend them as a company. I was surprised by how predatory I found the senior care referral industry entirely. First, they hardly saved me time. If it was actually possible to get in touch with communities reasonably easily I'd far prefer to contact them myself. APFM didn't have answers to most of my questions about a place so once I was actually connected with someone I'd still have to have a long conversation asking a bunch of questions. I would lose bargaining power simply for referrers being able to easily reach someone while I as a consumer couldn't. I even said something about trying to get in touch to a place to ask some questions and the woman I was talking to from APFM said \"[it was] because they give us the real numbers\". \n\nMore then one place said they could lower the community fee or not charge it but then saw we were referred for APFM and said they couldn't because of APFM. If you work with APFM and somehow have relationships with the places you're sending folks that's great but I have a hard time believing you could have too close of one since you're dealing with places all over the country. \n\nThe regional guy I worked with was more helpful for us. He had been to several of the places he recommended, he also understood exactly where my mother lives in relation to the places he was suggesting. I'd still recommend folks look on their own if in any position to before using someone. I found referrers were helpful in getting in touch with the more corporate places but family owned places answered their phones generally and returned calls quickly.\n\n## Comment ID l389i31 with +3 score by [(meetmypuka, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l389i31/) (in reply to ID 1cn9jcb):\nTerrible terrible terrible!

So if you mom or dad is a high level of care and the first months rent is like 9k it goes to that advisor that swooped in and got your information.

Avoid 'A Place for Mom' at All Costs!**\n\nI cannot stress enough how terrible my experience with 'A Place for Mom' has been. Even after informing them that my mother passed away, they continue to harass me with calls, as do the dozens of facilities they irresponsibly shared my contact information with—information I never authorized them to distribute. This service is an absolute waste of money and time.\n\nTheir promises are nothing but empty words. They assured me they would find a placement under $3,200 per month or refund the intake fee. Not only did they fail to deliver, but the only placement they found would have discontinued my mother's dialysis care within two weeks, effectively ending her life. When they couldn't find anything suitable, they backtracked on their refund promise, claiming that a location two hours away somehow fulfilled their commitment—despite it being completely impractical for us.\n\n'A Place for Mom' does nothing more than provide outdated, generic email lists that you could find yourself through a basic internet search. They have ZERO personal knowledge of the facilities they recommend, and multiple communities told me they were worthless and wished more people knew. You end up doing all the work to vet these places yourself while they continuously bombard you with calls, texts, and emails to squeeze money out of your situation. I ultimately found a far better non-profit in Atlanta that genuinely helped me find the right fit for my mom.

Mom would have needed memory care if dad died, but with him as an anchor she did fine in the ALF.  However, with lingering problems from the broken hip and extremely poor compliance with rehab, I don't see her ever getting back to the ALF, which has told me they \"generally won't take anyone that isn't at least 50% weight bearing.\"  I'm doubtful she will ever get back to that, and the ALF director (a very good guy) told me (with all kinds of caveats) that he is skeptical she will be able to come back.  The nursing home is using a slide board, which the ALF theoretically can use, but they seem reluctant to take someone back that may need that for a long time, or forever.  To make matters more complicated, dad categorically refuses to move out of the area, which is now prone to terrible traffic.  It often takes him 45 minutes to the nursing home mom is rehabbing in, so staying there long term is not a solution.  Its also not a great place, especially nights and weekends.  My dad would not meet the requirements to live in a nursing home without insurance fraud, and he'd probably go nuts with her in one of those tiny rooms.  At least in the ALF, he could get some space every now and then.  So the best situation would either be a facility with both a nursing home and an ALF, or two independent facilities very close together.  \n\n**The Need:**  Its sufficiently complicated and I'm sufficiently far away that I'm thinking if there is quality professional help out there, that would be great.  Anyone have positive or negative experiences with the various services?\n\n## Comment ID iuo4kdh with +11 score by [(SandhillCrane5, Reddit, 2022-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/yjbylo/thoughtsrecommendations_for_senior_placement/iuo4kdh/) (in reply to ID yjbylo):\nYou'd be better off hiring a private Geriatric Care Manager to help you find an appropriate place rather than severely limiting your options to facilities that need to pay a service for referrals. The better facilities do not utilize A Place for Mom and similar services. A licensed and certified Geriatric Care Manager is highly qualified and experienced and since you are hiring and paying them, their only goal will be to recommend the best care possible within your guidelines.

Example: My care facility determines that the cost of care is $5000 per month for your loved one. If you move them in and the referral came from A placement agency then I have to pay the agency $5000. \n\nEldercare placement agencies simply sell your family's name and number to care facilities that have agreed to work with them.

They’re a for profit referral service that does absolutely nothing themselves. And apparently they get paid per contact they make because this mother and son (their claim) wouldn’t stop calling me. Even after blocking their numbers they continued calling me on new numbers. And going by my caller ID, the same pair also work for Visiting Angels, Aging Care and a few other names that you’ll see pop up as sponsored sites when you google help for aging parents. I just want to warn as many people as I can about these scammers. It’s been over a year since I first gave them my number and I cannot get rid of them. If you want to find out for yourself, try filling out their form without giving them a phone number, or only giving them a landline number. If you get a message that a cell phone number is required information or not optional - you can be sure someone is attempting to get your number for the purpose of giving it to salesmen. Or selling it to other sites. Try that little test and save yourself a lot of grief.",

Hope to visit and walk the city, particularly the SE, in the nest 1-2 years. \n\nHowever, (because feeling a little defensive) the Northern California Bay Area is not as bad as the news might lead you to believe. Our forecast high today is 63 and highest over the next 10 days is 69. Air qualify at 18 is good.  July memories with kids include taking the ferry home from work, then zipping up their jackets before going for a walk to the playground. They loved summer school in July at UC Berkeley, first at Lawrence Hall of Science and later on campus classes for kids. Season tickets for kids at the San Francisco Symphony with events like Robin Williams narrating Peter and the Wolf. MIL was in a nearby nursing home just one block from a beach walkway, easily pushing her wheelchair. \n\nNow retired, we regularly take the ferry to SF to walk places like Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf etc, or drive to Fort Point and walk the Presidio/GG bridge/Palace of Fine Arts area, or drive to Fort Funston to hike, beach walk and watch the hang gliders because, in spite of the news, 99% of SF is clean and beautiful. Or even closer head to Redwood Regional Park in much maligned Oakland to hike in an absolutely gorgeous redwood forest. Or slightly longer drive to Marin County to hike Point Reyes National Seashore/Mount Tamalpais/Muir Woods areas. \n\nTo get a sense of how good the hiking - and related beauty - is in the Bay Area, there are over 1,000 trails [rated 4.5+ out of 5 on AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/us/california/san-francisco?b_tl_lat=38.12371479010139&b_tl_lng=-122.900391756588&b_br_lat=37.34115558502704&b_br_lng=-121.80564479624533&mobileMap=true&rating_min=4.5) within a 25 mile radius of SF.  \n\nWithin 25 miles the following are part of the National Park Service: San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, Presidio of San Francisco, Fort Point National Historic Site, Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park, Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial (*in recent news*), Point Reyes National Seashore, Fort Funston, Muir Woods National Monument, Alcatraz island, Eugene O'Neil National Historic Site, John Muir National Historic Site (his home in the east bay, not the woods).\n\n#### Comment ID lfekwyq with +1 score by [(Cold-Ad-7144, Reddit, 2024-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandrapids/comments/1eczuml/85_yr_old_mil_done_with_ca_fires_is_considering/lfekwyq/) (in reply to ID lf82gv2):\nI lived in SF for 11 years and also near Lake Tahoe. My MIL is in Chico. They have been dealing with evacuations since last week. The trauma from fires is real. She used to work in the town of Paradise. It burned down in 2018 with most evacuated to Chico. When not directly impacted by fire, Chico is in a valley that regularly fills up with smoke from other fires. Even if my house didn’t burn down, I personally know so many people impacted directly by fires over the last several years. It’s not getting better. It’s getting worse.\n\nI recently visited the Bay Area. Beautiful.

The “counselors” will send your loved ones information to every community they contract with in your general area, they do nothing to actually determine what is best for your loved one, they just want the money for the placement contract. If you are looking for care please check the Nursing Home Compare site on Medicare.gov or speak with the long term care ombudsman in your area. Google is also your friend, read reviews, take tours (most communities are happy to accommodate a virtual tour if needed), talk to others who have had to move their loved one into care, or look for local placement services (they’re smaller and tend to be actually client focused). I know it’s a struggle trying to find the right fit for the right care for your loved one but APFM will actually make your life harder, not easier.\n\n## Comment ID l6pojfp with +2 score by [(Ok-Strawberry-9838, Reddit, 2024-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1d55k9e/friendly_warning_do_not_use_a_place_for_mom/l6pojfp/) (in reply to ID 1d55k9e):\nI agree was not referred anywhere good for my mom.

I am a former senior advisor for a similar company. And we did things very differently. \n\nAPFM will hire any warm body that will work under their pressure.  I remember a time where you had to have experience to be an advisor for APFM. That stopped years ago.\n\n\nI have 16 years in the industry and spent most of that time in the dementia field.\nI truly “advised” and coached my families through the process because the industry is confusing. I was honest and taught them how to do their due diligence when vetting a community. After all, in most cases they were choosing their loved ones last home. Kind of a big deal. If they had an interest in a community we did NOT partner with, I still reached out and collected that info or set a tour there if the family wanted it. I know that isn’t the norm in this business. But I would appreciate it if the show was on the other foot.\n\nSenior living is big business and unfortunately that’s most businesses these days.\n\nAnd one fallacy I saw posted here by another user I want to clear up. APFM isn’t just used by bad communities that need heads in beds. Pretty much all your major senior living players use referral agencies and so do the lesser known communities to capture online business. This is and has been the model for sometime. The only exceptions tend to be CCRC communities and non profit or religious affiliated communities. And even some of them have changed course and started working with placement agencies both online and boots on the ground types.\n\n## Comment ID l7i5v7j with +1 score by [(wherespamgoeslol, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1d55k9e/friendly_warning_do_not_use_a_place_for_mom/l7i5v7j/) (in reply to ID 1d55k9e):\nTried going through them to find a place for my mom had one of the agents schedule an appointment for me to tour a facility and when I got there, the facility said they didn't have a tour scheduled for that day.

Thanks but no\n\n## Comment ID l9czupw with +1 score by [(sunny-day1234, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1dj429j/a_place_for_mom_investigation/l9czupw/) (in reply to ID 1dj429j):\nWe did use them, they gave us 3 names in the geographic area we wanted, and the rest of the criteria, I investigated the 3 and my brother and I toured them separately and together and chose one. They were all fine really. She's been in current one for 2+ yrs with no issues except price going up which has been across the board with anyone I've spoken to Maybe it depends on the Rep/Office.\n\n## Comment ID l9i7v8f with +1 score by [(Itsallgood2be, Reddit, 2024-06-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1dj429j/a_place_for_mom_investigation/l9i7v8f/) (in reply to ID 1dj429j):\nI made the mistake of putting my information into their system as I was looking for a place for my mom. All I wanted was pricing. They kept calling me like I owed them money, like a creepy ex boyfriend, like a religious group trying to recruit me - you get the idea 😆"

          "cons": "It's disheartening to recount my experience at A Place for Mom, which was marred by consistent mistreatment and disregard for employees' well-being. The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

      "# [The 7 Stages of Dementia by Leah Hallstrom on 2024-05-28](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-stages)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are seven stages of dementia, each with distinct symptoms. The stages are broken down into three phases of pre-, middle-, and late-stage dementia.\n\nDementia typically isn’t diagnosed until stage 4. Dementia stages 1, 2, and 3 are classified as pre-dementia stages, as symptoms aren’t yet severe enough for a diagnosis.\n\nThere’s no set timeline for how long each stage will last. Understanding the symptoms associated with each stage will help you monitor your loved one as the disease progresses.\n\nMemory care communities can help. Explore how thoughtfully designed memory care communities can support your loved one at any stage.\n\nWhat are the seven stages of dementia?\n\nHealth care providers use a comprehensive tool to assess the seven stages of dementia in the elderly called the Global Deterioration Scale.[01] Also known as the GDS, this trusted method enables caregivers and health professionals to determine how quickly dementia is progressing in an elderly patient. It also helps families and care providers know which symptoms to expect during each of the seven stages of dementia.\n\nLearning about the dementia stages can help caregivers track and monitor stage-related symptoms to identify a loved one’s brain-health status.\n\nThe seven stages of dementia include:\n\nStage 1: no cognitive impairment\n\nStage 2: very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3: mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 4: moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 5: moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6: severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 7: very severe cognitive decline\n\nHow does dementia progress?\n\nThe seven stages are separated into three progressive phases or levels of dementia:\n\nPre-dementia or early-stage dementia (stages 1, 2, and 3). In this initial phase, a person can still live independently and may not exhibit obvious memory loss or have any difficulty completing regular tasks. Mild dementia symptoms mimic episodes of age-related forgetfulness.\n\nModerate or middle-stage dementia (stages 4 and 5). Moderate dementia symptoms significantly affect a person’s personality and behavior. Someone with middle-stage dementia will generally need full- or part-time caregiver assistance with regular day-to-day activities. Moderate-stage dementia symptoms include significant cognitive impairment and mood swings.\n\nSevere or late-stage dementia (stages 6 and 7). These final phases are associated with severe cognitive impairment along with a loss of physical abilities. Late dementia symptoms can include pronounced memory loss, incontinence, and an inability to move without help.\n\nSpecific types of dementias — including Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia — advance at unique rates and differ from person to person. Therefore, it’s important to understand the signs and symptoms at each stage so you can quickly identify whether your loved one’s dementia has progressed. Read on for a look at the symptoms related to each stage.\n\nDementia stage 1: No cognitive impairment\n\nThough it may sound odd, stage 1 dementia often looks like normal mental functioning without any cognitive decline. Someone in the first three stages of dementia doesn’t usually exhibit enough symptoms to be diagnosed.\n\nWhile mild cognitive impairment may be present, stages 1, 2, and 3 on the GDS are recognized as pre-dementia stages. However, it’s important to note that changes in the brain are still taking place in these early stages, which could eventually lead to a dementia diagnosis at stage 4.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nDementia stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 2 dementia includes simple memory mistakes like a loved one wondering, “Where did I put my keys?” or “What was that person’s name?” This is a pre-dementia stage and does not yet warrant an official dementia diagnosis.\n\nA significant portion of the senior population experiences age-related forgetfulness, and caregivers or medical providers may not even notice such a mild impairment. This explains why stage 2 is also known as “age-associated memory impairment” on the GDS, meaning many older adults will experience symptoms like these at some point during aging.\n\n“About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age-associated memory impairment — in the United States, about 16 million people,” said Professor Gary W. Small in research published by the British Medical Association.[02] “Only about 1% of them will progress to dementia each year.”\n\nThis means that for many people, pre-dementia stage 2 does not progress to an official dementia diagnosis. Seniors can maintain at this stage for a long time or indefinitely with the right lifestyle changes that support their brain health.\n\nStage 2 dementia symptoms include:\n\nLosing track of familiar objects\n\nInability to recall names of friends, family members, and former acquaintances\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nDementia stage 3: Mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3 dementia is also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or decline. It doesn’t generally have a major effect on day-to-day functioning and may not yet result in an official dementia diagnosis. Memory and cognitive problems may become more regular and noticeable to caregivers and family members.\n\nHow quickly can this early dementia stage progress to a dementia diagnosis in the elderly?\n\nAn estimated 10 to 20 percent of people age 65 or older with MCI will develop recognizable or diagnosable dementia within a year, according to the National Institute on Aging.[03]\n\nSince MCI can precede more severe dementia, it’s important to recognize these stage 3 signs, and seek medical advice to support your brain health and keep the dementia from progressing.\n\nStage 3 dementia symptoms include:\n\nOften forgetting to go to appointments or events\n\nLosing things often\n\nGetting lost while traveling\n\nDecreased work performance\n\nDifficulty finding the right words\n\nVerbal repetition\n\nChallenges with organization and concentration\n\nTrouble with complex tasks and problem-solving\n\nProblems with driving\n\nDementia stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 4 dementia is when a person has clear, visible signs of cognitive impairment and also exhibits personality changes, with significant dementia behaviors and severe stage 3 symptoms. A person is not typically diagnosed with dementia until they’re at stage 4 or beyond.\n\nWhile the medical terminology for stage 4 dementia is moderate cognitive decline, this stage is officially diagnosed by the GDS as “mild dementia.” At this stage, doctors and caregivers will likely observe hallmark signs that dementia is getting worse, including difficulties with language and reduced problem-solving skills.\n\nStage 4 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSocial withdrawal\n\nEmotional moodiness\n\nLack of responsiveness\n\nReduced intellectual sharpness\n\nTrouble with routine tasks\n\nForgetting recent events\n\nDenial of symptoms\n\nDementia stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nThis stage marks the onset of what many professionals refer to as middle-stage dementia or “mid-stage” in the seven stages of dementia. At this point, a person may no longer be able to carry out normal activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing or bathing, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) without some caregiver assistance.\n\nStage 5 often lasts between two and four years, though every dementia patient will progress at a unique rate.[04]\n\nIn stage 5 dementia, your loved one will likely require more intense support and supervision. They know major facts about themselves — such as their name and their children’s names — but they may not remember their grandchildren’s names, their longtime address, or where they went to high school.\n\nStage 5 dementia symptoms include:\n\nPronounced memory loss, including personal details and current events\n\nWandering\n\nConfusion and forgetfulness\n\nDisorientation and sundown syndrome\n\nFurther reduced mental acuity and problem-solving ability\n\nDementia stage 6: Severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6 dementia marks a need for caregiver help to perform basic daily activities, such as eating, using the toilet, and other self-care. Seniors experiencing this stage of moderately severe dementia may have difficulty regulating sleep, interacting with others, or behaving appropriately in public settings.\n\nAt stage 6 of dementia, you may find yourself wondering if full-time care is necessary as symptoms become more complex. You can stay prepared by tracking symptoms, monitoring your loved one’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and exploring care options like memory care or home care.\n\nStage 6 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSleep difficulties\n\nUrinary or fecal incontinence\n\nAggression and anxiety\n\nPersonality changes including paranoia or delusions\n\nInability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nPronounced memory loss\n\nInability to recognize loved ones and caregivers\n\nDementia stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline\n\nIn stage 7, which is considered end-stage dementia, people can no longer care for themselves and are barely responsive as their verbal and physical capacities shut down. All verbal ability is lost, movement becomes severely impaired, and bodily organs begin to fail.\n\nStage 7 dementia symptoms include:\n\nInability to speak\n\nInability to remember loved ones or caregivers\n\nLack of physical ability to move without help\n\nInability to chew or swallow\n\nImpaired bodily functions, including breathing, and organ failure\n\nSleeping a lot\n\nUrinary and fecal incontinence\n\nHow long does this aggressive end stage of dementia last?\n\nThe final stage of dementia can typically last one to three years, but it’s difficult to predict since everyone is different.[05]\n\nHow fast does dementia progress?\n\nThere’s no way to predict how long it will take for a loved one to progress through all the stages of dementia. Lifestyle factors can make a big difference in how fast dementia will progress, like diet and exercise.\n\nDementia gets worse with time, but some people stay in the early stages of dementia longer and can remain independent for many years. Others may experience rapid dementia progression and will require more immediate support. Once a person reaches the final, most aggressive stage of dementia, they typically only have a couple years left.[05]\n\nHow long do people live with dementia?\n\nThe average person with a dementia diagnosis can live between four to eight years after diagnosis.[05] Some people, however, can live up to 20 years after their diagnosis.\n\nDifferent types of dementias, like Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, have different prognoses, with some causing more rapid deterioration than others. Individual factors like lifestyle and treatment plans are critical in slowing down the progression of dementia.\n\nHere’s a general outline of the average life expectancies across different dementias, according to the Alzheimer’s Society:[06]\n\nAlzheimer’s disease. The life expectancy range is between eight and 10 years.\n\nVascular dementia. People with vascular dementia face additional risk factors like stroke or heart attack, and the average life span is five years.\n\nLewy body dementia. A greater threat of injuries and infections places the life expectancy for dementia with Lewy bodies at around six years.\n\nFrontotemporal dementia. The expected lifespan ranges from six to eight years.\n\nHow to care for a loved one with dementia\n\nCaregivers have a variety of ways to provide support to a loved one through the progression of dementia:\n\nTry to have positive and meaningful conversations using effective dementia communication strategies.\n\nConsider exploring unique dementia treatment options and therapies.\n\nCreate a dementia care plan.\n\nConsider joining a support group for caregivers.\n\nLearn about dementia care techniques for caregivers.\n\nFind memory care options in your area.\n\nComing to accept a loved one’s dementia diagnosis, and understanding what to expect, can help you feel empowered and provide opportunities to make the most of this time together.\n\nIf the idea of navigating a dementia diagnosis alone seems overwhelming, A Place for Mom is here for you. Explore our library of caregiver resources, which contains hundreds of articles covering dementia therapies and information on memory care communities.\n\nMemory care options\n\nMemory care is specialized support for seniors with a dementia diagnosis. These communities provide 24-hour supervision by trained memory care caregivers to reduce anxiety, assist with ADLs, and prevent accidents caused by wandering.\n\nMemory care communities also provide comfortable and thoughtfully designed living arrangements, meal services, and trained on-site nurses ready administer health care as needed. Therapeutic on-site memory care activities, dining plans, and exercise programs (for both mind and body) address all types of dementia symptoms. Whether through in-home care or at a community, specialized memory care can be beneficial from the early stages of dementia through the end of life.\n\nUnderstanding when to seek memory care will vary depending on a senior’s dementia symptoms, health status, living situation, and more. Our Senior Living Advisors offer free guidance and are ready to discuss local memory care communities or dementia home care options with your family, tailored to your budget and individualized needs.",
      "# [11 Signs It Might Be Time for Assisted Living by Haines Eason on 2023-12-12](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/signs-its-time-for-assisted-living)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living communities can offer seniors the help they need while focusing on maintaining independence. A safe, supportive environment allows older adults to thrive.\n\nSeniors in assisted living often form connections with other residents. These friendships can help prevent senior isolation and increase a senior’s likelihood of participating in enriching activities.\n\nAssisted living communities can coordinate care for residents to reduce hospital visits and the risk of serious health complications. Doctors, physical therapists, and other health professionals may even provide services in the community.\n\nCaregivers are at serious risk for health complications of their own. Sixty-five percent of caregivers report sacrificing their own physical and mental health in order to care for a loved one.\n\nDoes your loved one require help with activities of daily living?\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing, bathing, and using the toilet, present frequent concerns for seniors. Approximately 14.2% of adults 75+ need personal care assistance as of 2022, according to data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[01]\n\nMedication management stands out as one of the most common concerns for seniors and caregivers. In a 2020 A Place for Mom survey of more than 1,000 caregivers, 60% were considering a move to assisted living for their senior loved one due to issues with medication management.[02] Errors in medication management can pose a real danger for seniors: The CDC estimates 350,000 people are hospitalized each year due to misuse of prescriptions.[03]\n\nBeyond medication management, assisted living communities provide help with other daily tasks, such as bathing, which benefits both seniors and their caregivers. For Linda Lagesse, 78, who served as her husband’s sole caregiver for nearly four years, an inability to assist with ADLs motivated her to contact A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors to find assisted living for her husband.\n\n“I bathed him. I dressed him. I tried to help him get exercise,” Lagesse recalls. “I was exhausted. It just got to be a lot.”\n\nRead more:10 Tips for Elderly Medication Management\n\nDo they need more opportunities for socialization?\n\nAlongside positive relationships with staff, seniors in assisted living often form connections with other residents. These friendships can help prevent senior isolation as well as increase a senior’s likelihood of participating in enriching activities.\n\nIf your loved one is living at home, they may sometimes seem bored or have little social interaction with other people their age. Assisted living remedies this by encouraging residents to get involved with senior-friendly activities like fitness classes, happy hours, game nights, and more.\n\nWould your loved one benefit from care coordination?\n\nBefore his move to assisted living, Lagesse’s husband experienced frequent health issues that continued to land him in the hospital.\n\n“He kept getting sick, which meant that he was not getting the care he needed from me,” Lagesse said.\n\nIn addition to the emotional and physical toll of these hospitalizations, her husband’s regular appointments with many doctors and specialists could become overwhelming.\n\nTo simplify this process, assisted living communities can coordinate care for residents. Doctors, physical therapists, and other health professionals may even provide services within the community. For residents who wish to continue to see their own doctors and care providers, transportation to nearby appointments may be provided. Additionally, care staff are in frequent communication between a resident’s physician and family, allowing you to stay informed and involved.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nWould a lifestyle without chores reduce stress?\n\nDaily chores and home upkeep can raise stress significantly for ailing seniors and their caregivers. Assisted living communities remove these responsibilities by providing services like:\n\nVacuuming\n\nDusting\n\nBed-making\n\nBathroom cleaning\n\nLaundry\n\nInterior maintenance\n\nTrash removal\n\nIs home maintenance more than your loved one can handle?\n\nEven if your loved one enjoys some of the chores associated with home ownership, there’s a lot to keep up with. Home repairs can be complex and expensive, and they can involve ladders, electrical wires, and other hazards. All of the following, and more, are the responsibility of the assisted living community:\n\nSidewalk and driveway clearing\n\nExterior repairs (roofing, siding, windows, etc.)\n\nElectrical and plumbing\n\nPainting\n\nLimb, leaf, and debris removal\n\nGeneral landscaping\n\nDoes your senior family member lack access to proper nutrition?\n\nSeniors often may lack the energy or resources to grocery shop. Plus, cooking can become challenging for loved ones as they age or lack the motivation to cook. This can have negative effects on senior nutrition.\n\nAccording to a 2020 A Place for Mom interview of 1,000 caregivers, nutrition was one of the top three reasons families determined it was time to move a loved one to assisted living.[02]\n\nHere are some of the dining options typically found in assisted living:\n\nComplete nutrition and ingredients that touch on every food group\n\nFresh fruit, healthy snacks, and drinks available at any time\n\nDaily menu with always-available options\n\nThe option to select a special meal plan that accounts for diabetic, low-sodium, kosher, and other diets\n\nDining rooms designed to foster conversation during meals\n\nCan you continue to provide adequate care long-term?\n\nIf caring for your aging loved one has made achieving balance in your life more difficult, it may be time for assisted living. Take a proactive approach to find trained, compassionate, round-the-clock care through assisted living. Doing so can allow you to focus on your relationship with your senior loved one without the pressures of having to be constantly attentive to their needs.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that there’s a hidden cost to family caregiving. This cost can be direct, like home accommodation expenses — wheelchair ramps, safety locks, grab bars — or indirect, like lost wages or career advancement opportunities.\n\nIn other words, it’s crucial to be honest and realistic about your caregiving commitment and the expectations you’re placing on yourself.\n\nHave friends or family members noticed changes in you or your loved one?\n\nHave friends and family members commented that your loved one’s health may be worsening or that they may need more mental stimulation? Is your loved one experiencing sudden weight loss? While these aren’t automatic signs to seek out assisted living, they can present opportunities to explore your options.\n\nIt’s also necessary to consider how caregiving is affecting you. Unfortunately, caregivers are often the last to notice their own burnout and fatigue. In these situations, family members and friends can act as accountability partners in protecting your mental and emotional health.\n\n“One of my friends stayed with my husband so that I could get away for a couple of days. When I got home, he met me at the front door and said, ‘Linda, you cannot continue to do this. This is too much,’” says Lagesse. “That was really the turning point. It was eight days later that my husband ended up back in the hospital. I knew I had to do something. I couldn’t continue to do what I was doing.”\n\nAssisted living questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nDoes their physician recommend assisted living?\n\nWhile the perspective of family and friends can play a pivotal role, some caregivers and seniors might want a medical evaluation. In these scenarios, seeking counsel from your senior loved one’s doctor can give much-needed insight.\n\nFor Lagesse, this meant reaching out to her husband’s cardiologist and his primary care physician, both of whom supported her in moving her husband to assisted living.\n\nJust as a doctor’s opinion can comfort a caregiver, it can also boost a senior’s confidence and enthusiasm in the decision to move to assisted living. Seniors are more likely than people of other ages to trust their doctors and take medical advice, according to a 2019 survey from Pew Research Center.[04]\n\nIs your own mental and physical health suffering?\n\nIn addition to all the time you spend caring for your senior loved one, take time to check in with and prioritize yourself. Sometimes, the main sign it’s time for assisted living is your own health and capacity for care.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n\nHow are you feeling about yourself?\n\nHow are you feeling about the person you’re supporting?\n\nHow are you feeling about how your life is going?\n\nHow are you feeling about the amount of sleep and rest you’re getting?\n\nHow are you feeling about other aspects of your life that you’re responsible for?\n\nDoes the person you’re supporting enjoy being with you?\n\nWhen caregivers have negative answers to these questions on a regular basis, it can signal the need to step away from a full-time caregiving role.\n\nSo, is there a right time to move a parent or loved one to assisted living? While the answer is unique to each individual, one very important indicator is whether a caregiver is consistently overwhelmed. A Place for Mom’s 2020 survey found that nearly two out of three primary caregivers have arrived at this breaking point: 65% reported sacrificing their own physical and mental health in order to care for a loved one.[02]\n\nOn top of worsening the burden on the caregiver, feelings of stress can harm senior health and jeopardize the relationship between senior and caregiver long-term. Alongside the negative mental impacts of caregiving, the physical health repercussions are shocking: More than half of caregivers have been diagnosed with two or more chronic conditions, according to the 2020 AARP Caregiving in the U.S. survey.[05]\n\nCaring for a family member shouldn’t mean neglecting your own health — persistent health problems may signal that it’s time for assisted living.\n\nIs your loved one largely independent?\n\nLevison urges families and caregivers who are considering senior living to educate themselves on the various types of care available and the many differences between those options.\n\n“If your loved one is experiencing cognitive decline and needs constant supervision, then they would need memory care as opposed to an assisted living facility,” says Levison. “Also, if it’s difficult for them to hold a conversation, they would be more comfortable in a memory care facility where residents have similar abilities. If an individual is requiring regular skilled nursing care due to complicated medical issues, it might be time to consider a nursing home as an option.”\n\nThough there are exceptions, assisted living generally isn’t a good fit for individuals with dementia, stage 3 and 4 wounds, or advanced diabetes. Similarly, seniors who require access to 24/7 on-site nurses would benefit from more advanced care.\n\nIn general, seniors in assisted living are mostly independent, but they may need help with brushing their teeth, taking their medications, showering, or other activities of daily living. Seniors may also choose assisted living for socialization and mental stimulation. To see if your loved one would thrive in an assisted living setting, nurses typically perform a pre-move assessment.\n\nFeel confident and prepared to tour\n\nThis downloadable guide helps you identify what to look for in a community and the key questions to ask when you visit.\n\nDownload the assisted living touring guide >\n\nNext steps for finding assisted living\n\nIf you’ve answered the questions above and determined that your loved one may need additional care, you may be unsure of your next steps. This is normal — moving to assisted living is a big life change for both you and your loved one. But don’t shy away from the challenge.\n\n“In my experience, families and caregivers often wait until things are progressing to a breaking point before looking for assisted living options,” says Levison. And, she adds, both senior well-being and caregiver mental health may be strained by the time many families begin looking for care.\n\nThe following steps are helpful to keep in mind as you navigate this change with your parent.\n\nDecide how to talk to your senior loved one and other family members\n\nYou may be the primary caregiver for your parent, or maybe you noticed some concerning changes the last time you visited. Either way, take a moment now to consider whether you’ll bring this up first with your senior loved one, other family members, or discuss it as a group. Keep in mind that there’s no right answer here. You know your family dynamics best, but do include your loved one as early in the process as you can. No matter how you bring up assisted living, be prepared to listen to your loved one and plan for multiple discussions.\n\nConsult your loved one’s doctor\n\nYou may think you know which kind of senior care would be best for your loved one, but if you’re at all unsure, you may want to consult their doctor. They may be able to give you a more complete picture of what your loved one needs, as well as insights into the coming years.\n\nGather important documents\n\nNow is the time to gather your parent’s essential documents, whether financial, legal, or health related. These could include life insurance policies, a long-term care insurance policy, military discharge paperwork, or a living will. Having these ahead of time will help you make a plan to pay for care. Some insurance policies or benefits may have a waiting period, so gather these sooner rather than later.\n\nDecide what’s most important in a community\n\nIn order for your parent to have the best experience transitioning to assisted living, you need to find a community that meets their wants and needs. If the idea of choosing an assisted living community sounds challenging, we’re here to help. You can talk with one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors to learn more about assisted living communities near you. They can discuss your family’s specific budget and needs and set up tours with local communities, all at no cost to you.\n\nArticle optimized by A Place for Mom senior copywriter Rebecca Schier-Akamelu.",
      "# [Assisted Living vs. Memory Care: 5 Key Differences by Merritt Whitley on 2024-09-20](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-memory-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living provides caregiver assistance that focuses on activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing.\n\nMemory care provides specialized assistance for seniors with dementia that focuses on safety in a specially designed environment.\n\nSome assisted living communities offer memory care on-site, making it easy for seniors to get the care they need without moving.\n\nMemory care costs more than assisted living due to the added care and supervision that residents need.\n\nThe differences between assisted living and memory care\n\nIt’s normal to wonder about your loved one’s care needs, whether they have a dementia diagnosis or you’re simply noticing a change in their cognitive abilities. About 70% of adults older than 65 will need long-term care, and many will have some type of cognitive decline or memory loss.[01]\n\nMaureen Bradley gained valuable experience working in assisted living communities and as a memory care director before joining A Place for Mom. She explains the overlap between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“The average age in assisted living these days is around 85, and that age group makes up nearly three-quarters of the people who have dementia. What this means is that it’s very common for people in assisted living communities to be in the early stages of dementia,” says Bradley.\n\nStill, you’ll want to evaluate both types of senior living communities carefully to make sure your parent’s needs will be met.\n\n1. Safety\n\nGeneral assisted living communities may offer safety features like in-room emergency alert systems and daily check-ins. For seniors with memory loss, increased safety is a major concern, as wandering, aggression, and falls are common and dangerous dementia behaviors.\n\nTo help keep residents safe, memory care-specific communities often have added security features such as:\n\nLocked entrances and exits\n\nKeypad entries\n\nObscured exits\n\nDoorbells that signal entering and exiting\n\nTo reduce anxiety and avoid injuries from falls, facility layouts include design elements that minimize confusion. Plus, memory care communities provide additional calming therapies within soothing spaces. This added level of care is aimed at reducing the agitation and confusion that may lead to aggression or self-injury in persons with dementia.\n\n2. Staff training and care\n\nStaff members at both assisted living and memory care facilities have experience supporting residents with day-to-day tasks. But staff at memory care facilities are specially trained in dementia care and provide supervision to residents around the clock. This helps seniors with dementia maintain cognitive skills, a sense of self, and quality of life for as long as possible.\n\n“Memory care communities tend to have a much higher caregiver-to-resident ratio. This is important because it can take longer to provide ADL care, and people in memory care often need more direct oversight for safety and social engagement,” says Bradley.\n\nCaregivers at memory care facilities are trained to effectively and compassionately prevent and manage difficult dementia behaviors, such as wandering and aggression. They understand the balance of encouraging residents to stay as independent as possible while providing the support they need.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\n3. Amenities\n\nAmenities vary greatly from one community to the next, but most assisted living communities offer the following:\n\nGyms\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nOutdoor spaces like gardens or courtyards\n\nPet-friendly accommodations\n\nTransportation services\n\nLibrary, TV, and game rooms\n\nArts and crafts studios\n\nSpas or relaxation rooms\n\nMemory care communities often feature many of these same amenities, but you’ll also find unique layouts and design features to help orient residents and reduce confusion. For instance, design elements in memory care communities may include the following:\n\nClearly defined common areas\n\nColor-coded walls to make it easier for residents with memory loss to find their way\n\nOutdoor gardens to prevent residents from feeling trapped or confined\n\nIncreased opportunities for personalization, like memory boxes outside of residents’ doors to guide and help them feel at home\n\n4. Activities and therapies\n\nAssisted living staff organize activities for active seniors who may need some help with everyday tasks. With this demographic in mind, assisted living offers plenty of social opportunities. A wide range of planned activities are scheduled to appeal to different interests. These activities may include:\n\nExercise classes\n\nBook clubs\n\nGames\n\nParties\n\nKaraoke\n\nOutings\n\nMemory care offers both group and individual memory care activities and therapies designed specifically for seniors with memory loss.\n\n“There’s focus on structure, sensory stimulation, getting direct sunlight whenever possible, and cultivating engagement. All of these things minimize or even eliminate sundowning, help with sleep patterns, and allow residents to enjoy their days,” Bradley says.\n\nMany memory care facilities provide activities tailored to residents’ interests and programs that encompass the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health.\n\nSome of the specialized therapies available at memory care communities may include the following:\n\nMusic therapy, which promotes relaxation and reduces agitation in seniors with Alzheimer’s or other types of dementia\n\nArt therapy, which may help slow cognitive decline\n\nReminiscence therapy, which uses senses like smell, taste, touch, and sight to help seniors remember people, events, and places\n\nPet therapy for companionship\n\n5. Costs\n\nMany factors affect the costs of assisted living and memory care, including the following:\n\nLocation\n\nRoom size\n\nWhether a space is shared with a roommate\n\nWhat services are provided\n\nBeyond this, costs are calculated a little differently for each care type.\n\nGeneralized assisted living communities typically charge a base monthly rate that covers the following:\n\nRoom and board with three meals a day and snacks\n\nMost activities (outings may cost extra)\n\nHousekeeping and laundry\n\nTransportation to and from medical appointments\n\nHelp with ADLs may be an additional charge, depending on how much assistance a resident needs.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, the nationwide median price of assisted living community is $4,995 per month.[02] The cost of memory care tends to be higher, with a median monthly cost of $6,200 per month across our partner communities.[02]\n\nMemory care communities are more expensive because they offer specialized care and services that general assisted living communities typically don’t offer.\n\nAssisted living vs. memory care: What services are offered?\n\nThis chart summarizes the key differences in services offered at assisted living and memory care communities.\n\nServicesAssisted LivingMemory CareHelp with ADLsxxMeal servicexxMedication managementxxCare coordinationxxHousekeeping and laundry servicesxxExercise classesxxTransportation to appointmentsxxSpecialized care for dementia and memory lossx24-hour care and supervisionxxSecured entrances and exits to prevent wanderingxMemory-enhanced therapiesxHigh staff-to-resident ratioxUnique layouts to reduce confusionx\n\nRead related article:Find Assisted Living for Adults with Mental Illness: A How-To Guide\n\nHow to decide between assisted living and memory care\n\nBradley encourages families to be mindful of their loved one’s prognosis as they consider the main differences between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“It helps to understand the kind of dementia your loved one has and how quickly it is expected to progress,” says Bradley.\n\nSome seniors in the middle stages of dementia may begin to need a higher level of supervision. For others, this happens a little later. It’s best to include input from your loved one’s doctors or other caregivers when making a decision.\n\nChoosing assisted living\n\nAssisted living may be a good fit for your loved one if memory loss isn’t an immediate concern or if they’re in the early stages of dementia. Sometimes it may also be a good fit for seniors experiencing the middle stages of dementia, provided that they don’t wander.\n\n“Assisted living communities can be very helpful with things that matter during the early- and mid-stages of dementia, such as managing medications and helping with reminders for showering, meal times, and the like,” Bradley says.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how advanced your loved one’s dementia is, you may want to speak with their doctor to determine if they’re showing signs it might be time for memory care.\n\nChoosing memory care\n\nAs dementia progresses and symptoms worsen, many families do opt for memory care.\n\n“Oftentimes, safety is the driving factor for deciding it’s time to make the switch to memory care,” says Bradley. “If their loved one is prone to going for walks and getting lost, for example, assisted living is no longer an option. They may also start doing things like trying to drink their shampoo or get restless later in the day.”\n\nIn addition to a memory care facility’s built-in security features, the 24-hour oversight provided by staff in a memory care community can significantly add to a senior’s safety.\n\nMemory care in assisted living: A promising third option\n\nSome assisted living communities also offer advanced memory care units on-site, so that both care types are available within the same community. This can be a good long-term care option for seniors. For instance, a senior with early-stage dementia may be able to move to a general assisted living community first and then transition to the memory care level later, if needed.\n\n“This is the ideal situation,” says Bradley. “It’s much less traumatic for the person living with dementia to simply change rooms or locations in the same community. They know the staff, recognize the surroundings, and oftentimes there’s intermingling for activities and events. They can still see their friends.”\n\nOn the other hand, moving from one community to a completely new one may require more thoughtfulness from family members to help ensure that the move goes smoothly.\n\n“As dementia progresses, moving someone can be very hard on them and even trigger a big decline in condition,” says Bradley.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps as you consider memory care\n\nWhen you’re weighing options, it’s important to remember that each community is unique and what’s available to you will vary depending on your loved one’s location and budget.\n\n“I would strongly encourage families to check out a number of care settings,” says Bradley. “In some places, memory care may have advanced-stage dementia residents and look like a skilled nursing setting. Other memory care communities have more active, vibrant populations. There’s a wide variety of culture and care approaches, including specialized neighborhoods and the Montessori model.”\n\nAccording to Bradley, this might be the most important part of the process.\n\n“Finding the right fit for your loved one can make all the difference when it comes to quality of life for Mom or Dad and satisfaction for the rest of the family.”\n\nIf you’re looking for options in your area, A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help by considering your loved one’s lifestyle, budget, and abilities to make the right recommendations — all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [10 Tips for Dealing With Irrational Elderly Parents by Nirali Desai on 2024-05-22](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/parents-wont-listen)\nKey Takeaways\n\nInvolve your parent as much as possible in care needs discussions, as this will help them play an active role in their own care.\n\nRemember that your parent has the final say, and although you may disagree with some of your parent’s choices, it’s not your decision to make.\n\nTake care of yourself — you can manage the stress of a difficult parent by taking breaks from caregiving and turning to others for support.\n\nInvolve other people your parent trusts, because they're more likely to take your concerns seriously if they know others feel the same way.\n\n1. Initiate the conversation early\n\nHealth complications aren’t always predictable, so planning early may not be an option for all families. However, if your parent shows minor signs of aging or weight loss, you may want to start the conversation about their future care needs early.\n\n“Talk to them when they are still thriving and in control,” said Amy McLoughlin, a learning and development specialist at A Place for Mom with more than 17 years of experience in the senior living industry. She said that reaching out when your parent is still autonomous allows you to talk about hypotheticals without any stress. You can talk through what your parent wants in the event of a stroke, dementia diagnosis, or other medical conditions that may run in the family.\n\nAn early conversation also enables your parent to think about how their needs may affect your life in the future. While they’re healthy, they may be able to more easily see how their needs could end up burdening you in an unexpected situation.\n\nBe sure to think about scenarios where a parent may not be able to make decisions. If they were to become incapacitated, who would they want in charge? If they select a trustworthy power of attorney (POA) in advance, they can avoid potentially difficult situations in the future.\n\n2. Understand your parent’s concerns and behaviors\n\nAging is a difficult process for virtually everyone. Many older adults are living with dementia or mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Recognize where your parent is coming from, so you can choose the best approach when broaching the topic of them accepting help. While you’re likely focused on safety, your parent’s top priority is likely maintaining their autonomy.\n\n“Realizing that your parent’s autonomy is important to them can be beneficial as well,” said social worker Suzanne Modigliani, a Massachusetts-based life care specialist who works with families to solve elder care problems.\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF\n\n• Is my parent acting this way out of habit?\n\n• Is my parent worried about losing their independence?\n\n• Is my parent suffering from depression or anxiety?\n\n• Is my parent confused, or do they have dementia?\n\n• What are some things my parent may be fearing?\n\nIdentifying the root causes of your parent’s behavior can help you choose the best way to make positive changes.\n\nRead more:Common Dementia Behaviors: Expert Tips for Understanding and Coping\n\n3. Evaluate your loved one’s current situation\n\nDon’t expect to make big changes overnight. Even if you think your parent needs help, acknowledge what they can still do as a way of showing them that you value their independence. For example, if your parent needs some help with cleaning but still enjoys cooking, don’t suggest hiring someone who will help with both.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that although you have your parent’s best interests at heart, they’re in control of their own life and care options. Accepting this fact, as hard as it is, can help lower your stress and even improve your relationship with your aging parent.\n\nStart with the most important issues\n\nDecide what issues are the most important and focus on those — at least initially. Matters involving your parent’s safety at home, for instance, should take top priority. Your parent will be much more likely to take your concerns seriously if you don’t bombard them with several at once, even if the concerns are valid.\n\nUntil your other concerns are addressed, it might help your case to stop insisting that your parent complete nonessential tasks. While beneficial, things like updating their phone and joining a fitness class can be put on hold.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\n4. Be calm, but stay persistent\n\nWhen you ask someone to make changes to their lifestyle, it’s a big deal, so you shouldn’t expect to reach a conclusion after one conversation. Whether you talk about a move to assisted living or suggest a small adjustment to their diet, it may still put your parent on edge. They’ll need time to process the points you bring up.\n\nWhenever you bring up any topic relating to your parent’s care, plan to do so when things are going smoothly and neither you nor your parent is overly stressed. Talking about significant life changes when one or both of you is upset will only make the discussion more difficult.\n\n“Communicate without emotion and try to catch them on a good day,” McLoughlin suggested.\n\nIf they’re generally doing well, you can approach the conversation with some simple questions like:\n\nWhat could be better in your life?\n\nWhat’s the most important thing for you as you age?\n\nWhat or who can help improve the quality of your life?\n\n5. Treat your parent like an adult\n\nEven if you believe your parent is behaving irrationally, it doesn’t mean you can or should talk down to them — and try not to give your parent orders. Treat them like the adult they are, and remember that no one responds well to nagging.\n\n“Avoid infantilizing your parent,” said Dr. Robert Kane, former director of the Center on Aging and author of The Good Caregiver. “Dealing with a stubborn parent is not the same as dealing with a stubborn child. Older people should be autonomous.”\n\nTry asking good questions\n\nInstead of telling your parent what to do, try asking open-ended questions, such as “How do you feel about keeping up with home maintenance?” This will help your parent open up instead of leading them to feel defensive about their current lifestyle.\n\n“You have to realize they’re an adult, and they’re allowed to make their own decisions — even if you think it’s the wrong one,” said McLoughlin.\n\nShe explained that if you feel like you’ve done everything in your power to get your loved one to accept help, and they still refuse, then you have to give yourself permission to let go. It’s important to remember that you tried, and their refusal to accept help is not a reflection of you, McLoughlin said.\n\n6. Step back when things are out of your control\n\nSometimes, all you can do is offer your advice and then let your parent choose.\n\nProfessional family mediator Roseann Vanella of Marlton, New Jersey, used this strategy while assisting her elderly parents who refused help. Her father has dementia, and her mother has a rare blood disorder. Still, her mother insisted on taking her husband to Sicily on vacation.\n\n“I can’t stop you, so at least get medical jet insurance,” Vanella advised. Her mother said she would.\n\nSoon after arriving in Italy, her mother’s disease flared up. She needed a blood transfusion — at home. Vanella’s mother admitted she never purchased the insurance, so Vanella and her brother were on the next plane to Italy.\n\n“The hardest part is knowing something could have been averted but wasn’t,” she said. “My advice is not to hit your head against the wall too hard. There isn’t a lot we can do sometimes but stand by, watch closely, and be able to jump in when needed.”\n\nCreate a backup plan\n\nMcLoughlin suggested having a backup plan in place for parents who continue to refuse help. For instance, if you’ve seen balance problems in your elderly mother who won’t do anything about it, you may be fearful of her falling and suffering from an injury that results in a serious surgery.\n\nHospital visits after falls in seniors are often followed up with a stay in a skilled nursing or assisted living facility. You can plan ahead and make it easier on your family by looking into potential places to move your senior parent into in the event of such a fall.\n\nDoing this ahead of time will help you be more present in the moment, so you can enjoy your time with your loved one instead of arguing. It’ll also prevent you from rushing the process and moving them into a place where they may not be happy.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\n7. Create a support system for your parent\n\nIf you’re the person who has the most conversations with your parent about their care and safety concerns, it might be time to bring in some outside assistance. See if you can attend a doctor’s appointment with your parent, or speak to their neighbors, pastor, or anyone else who your parent sees frequently. If you’re concerned about your parent’s cognitive abilities, getting another perspective can be even more important.\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: INVOLVE YOUR LOVED ONES\n\nIn many cases, it’s important to gather their friends or siblings. Ask them for advice, because your parent may be more likely to accept help if someone in a similar stage of life sees that they could benefit from it.\n\nShare your concerns with the people your parent respects. This will hopefully help your parent realize that others share the same concerns about their health and safety as you do. It may also give your parent a larger group of people to lean on should they ever need help. Plus, removing any underlying issues from your family dynamic can help them form a clearer view of their own abilities and needs.\n\nRead more:How to Speak to Your Parent's Doctors: Tips for Successful Communication With Your Parent and Their Care Team\n\n8. Be honest with how it all affects you\n\nAnother approach to assisting an elderly parent who refuses help is to be direct about how it affects you. Communicate your worries or guilt to your parent, and explain how your anxieties will be tempered if they follow your advice.\n\nIn many cases, your parent may be more willing to change their behavior for a loved one if they see it is harmful. For example, you may convince your parent to quit smoking by pointing out the risks of smoking around their grandchildren. They may also be more willing to accept caregiving help if they understand how worried you are about their well-being.\n\nRemember that you’re not alone\n\nA whopping 77% of adults believe their parents are stubborn when it comes to accepting help with daily tasks, according to a study by researchers at Penn State University.[01]\n\n“I can’t even begin to tell you how many times my husband and I have suggested options to improve my parents’ quality of life, and they’ve turned us down,” said Mary Heitger-Marek, a program analyst from Annapolis, Maryland. “I feel like we could open a senior care business because of all the programs, aid, and other things we’ve looked into for them.”\n\nUnfortunately, Heitger-Marek’s feelings are common among adult children who take on caregiving duties for their aging parents. Consider connecting with others in situations similar to yours, or take time to de-stress.\n\nFind ways to manage your stress\n\nIf you’re upset that your elderly parent refuses to move to a safer living situation or take their medication as directed, it’s important to vent — but not to your parent. Instead, confide in or strategize with a friend, sibling, therapist, or members of an online support group. Finding ways to manage stress is especially important if you’re the primary caregiver to your aging parent.\n\nIt’s easy to become overwhelmed with frustration, fear, and anxiety when constantly assisting an elderly parent who refuses help, no matter how deeply you care about them. Guard against this by caring for yourself and finding activities or hobbies that help you release negative emotions.\n\n9. Plan your parent’s future together\n\nInvolving your aging loved one in long-term care planning conversations may help motivate them to receive needed care. Many seniors may be aware they need help but are unsure of how to ask for it on their own. If you show your concern in a loving, sensitive way, this can be a great way to strengthen bonds with your aging parent.\n\nHowever, talking to your loved one about senior living can also feel intimidating. Our five-step guide makes it easier. This downloadable resource can help you start an empathetic dialogue, ask important questions, and identify next steps.\n\nDownload the conversation guide >\n\nThink about costs and how to pay for senior care\n\nIf cost is a concern, you might talk through long-term care payment methods together with your loved one. Senior care facilities are often more affordable than families initially think, because aging at home comes with expenses you wouldn’t necessarily expect. To compare your parent’s current living expenses against senior living options near them, you can use A Place for Mom’s senior living cost calculator.\n\n10. Explore ways to help your senior parent accept help\n\nListen to your parent’s needs. Although you have their best interests at heart, remind yourself that, in the end, they have autonomy over their decisions. Have open conversations, and establish a middle ground where everyone is comfortable. Try to do all of this while ensuring the elderly adult at the center of the conversation understands that you’re coming from a place of love and care.\n\nYou can also consult one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors. At no cost to your family, these experts in senior living can offer local advice and care options, from home care to assisted living or memory care.\n\nHaving a small group of communities or home care agencies to reference provides a good starting point for your conversation with your parent and helps avoid overwhelming them with options. You can talk about the pros and cons of different care options, and you can give your parent the opportunity to tell you what’s most important to them for their future care needs.",
      "# [Assisted Living vs. Home Care by Melissa Bean on 2024-09-17](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-home-care)\nAssisted living communities are designed for seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Housing, meals, and social activities are usually provided. Plus, some assisted living communities help seniors coordinate on-site skilled nursing services to prevent a move if their care needs change.\n\nBenefits of assisted living\n\nMany elderly people might prefer to stay at home longer because they fear change, says Michelle Aweshah, a regional manager at A Place for Mom. However, over time, assisted living communities can feel like home, too.\n\nSeniors in assisted living, as well as their loved ones, can look forward to multiple benefits.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAssisted living can provide either short-term or long-term care, depending on a resident’s needs — it doesn’t have to be a permanent decision.\n\n“Some people feel assisted living might be their ‘final place’ and are afraid that they won’t like it once they move,” says Aweshah. “The great news is, in most cases, assisted living communities only require a 30-day notification of a move, even if you signed to stay a year.”\n\nRound-the-clock care\n\nIn addition to providing flexibility, assisted living offers care day and night, as needed. The various skills of staff members in assisted living play a pivotal role in supporting the well-being and safety of residents.\n\n“There are aides on staff around the clock to assist with personal care needs,” says Aweshah. “Most communities also have nurses on-site, as well as mobile services for physician appointments, therapy services, and more.”\n\nSocial activities and services\n\n“For many, being home may feel independent, but if they’re unable to drive, don’t visit friends as often anymore, or don’t eat as well, this can be very isolating and can lead to depression,” says Aweshah. “Being ‘independent’ can quickly become a detriment to quality and longevity of life.”\n\nAssisted living communities provide planned on- and off-site leisure activities as well as social activities, like happy hours and holiday celebrations, which are all very popular with residents. Additional benefits of assisted living can include a host of helpful amenities and services:\n\nNutritious meals and snacks\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nConcierge services\n\nGyms and pools\n\nGame rooms\n\nMovie theaters\n\nTransportation to offsite activities or appointments\n\nBusiness centers\n\nMail services\n\nIf you’ve decided assisted living is the right fit, touring can help you compare communities and ask key questions.

Aside from enjoying the comfort of familiar surroundings, seniors can benefit from several other aspects of home care.\n\nCompanionship\n\nA major benefit of home care is that it offers one-on-one companionship. Some home care aides will plan in-home activities — such as reading aloud, playing games, or simply sitting and talking — to keep seniors engaged. They can tailor meaningful care services to the unique preferences and needs of your loved one.\n\nHelp with activities of daily living\n\nIn-home caregivers provide seniors with assistance for personal care tasks as well as helping out around the house. It’s typical for a caregiver to help with:\n\nMeal preparation\n\nHousekeeping\n\nTransportation\n\nBathing\n\nBathroom assistance\n\nDressing\n\nGrooming\n\nCustomizable care\n\nYou can decide what in-home caregivers focus on based on your loved one’s needs and lifestyle. It’s easy to customize care services. For example, if your loved one is social, regular transportation to events and activities can be organized as part of the caregiver’s routine. If someone prefers to stay at home and would rather have more help with cooking or cleaning, in-home caregivers can arrange that, as well.\n\nMany home care agencies will note whether they have caregivers experienced in specialized forms of care. This can be helpful for seniors with a progressive illness — such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, or a disability — to receive the customized care they need.\n\nThe median nationwide cost of assisted living is $4,995 per month, according to A Place for Mom’s 2024 report on the cost of long-term care and senior living. In comparison, the national median cost of in-home care is $30 per hour. For full-time care at home, the cost is $5,720 per month, based on a schedule of 44 hours per week.[01]\n\nAt nearly a $725 difference per month, finances can definitely play a role in choosing care. However, it’s important to consider what you get with each type of care and how these costs are determined before making a decision.\n\nHow are assisted living costs calculated?\n\nAssisted living costs typically include care services, housing, and meals in one monthly fee. The monthly costs can vary greatly depending on factors like apartment size, state of residence, whether your senior loved one chooses to live with a roommate, and their required level of care.\n\nWhat costs are associated with home care?\n\nJust like with any market, in-home care prices depend on supply and demand. Costs for home care can vary greatly based on your location, the home care agency, staff salaries, and more. Remember that home health care is a little different, because it’s medical care ordered by a physician and may be covered by Medicare or private insurance.\n\nFamilies and seniors considering home care should evaluate additional, related costs, like utilities, maintenance repairs, and groceries. For an in-depth look at how the cost of home care would compare to assisted living costs in your area, try using A Place for Mom’s senior living cost calculator. You’ll be able to factor in common home expenses like utilities, groceries, and home maintenance when weighing your senior care options.\n\nHow can I pay for assisted living and home care?\n\nThere are a variety of ways to afford assisted living or home care for your loved one. It’s important to consider that each situation is unique and that not everyone will be eligible for the options presented below. Programs and policies may also change without notice.\n\nPayment options for assisted living may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nPublic programs. Medicaid, Medicaid waivers, and Medicare may cover some expenses related to assisted living.\n\nVA and military benefits. Veterans, veteran spouses, Gold Star families, and other eligible military-connected people may be able to use pensions, disability compensation, and military retirement funds to pay for care.\n\nInsurance. Your loved one may be able to have some expenses covered by their private health insurance or their long-term care insurance.\n\nPaying out of pocket. Investments, retirement funds, savings, home equity, and more may be used to pay for assisted living expenses.\n\nIn some cases, related services and costs for assisted living may be covered while room and board isn’t. Check with the program or policy you wish to use for more information on what they cover and what you’ll be responsible for.\n\nSimilar to assisted living payment options, your loved one may be able to pay for home care through the following options:\n\nGovernment-funded initiatives. Medicare, Medicaid, and the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) may help with expenses related to in-home care.\n\nVeterans benefits. Eligible military-connected individuals may be able to use pensions, disability compensation, or military retirement funds to cover the cost of in-home care. Some expenses may be covered through VA health care or TRICARE coverage.\n\nInsurance programs. Your loved one may be able to utilize a long-term care or life insurance policy to cover in-home care expenses.\n\nPrivate pay. Retirement funds, pension funds, savings, and other investments may be used to pay for in-home care.",
      "# [50+ Engaging Memory Care Activities for Seniors by Nirali Desai on 2024-07-10](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-activities)\nKey Takeaways\n\nMemory care activities must be personalized to soothe and stimulate residents, improve their cognitive function, and reduce common dementia symptoms.\n\nMemory care activity ideas are diverse and informed by residents, and they include favorite exercises, social events, and creative hobbies.\n\nMemory care communities promote reminiscence by incorporating familiar music, movies, foods, and scents into activities to help with residents’ memory recall and mood.\n\nMemory care activity calendars vary between communities, so talk to a senior living expert to find a suitable fit for a loved one with dementia.\n\nBenefits of memory care activities\n\nResearch shows that therapeutically stimulating activities for memory care patients have many benefits in long-term care settings. For instance, it can improve cognitive function, communication skills, and promote self-worth. It can also reduce loneliness, reliance on medications, and occurrence of common dementia symptoms.[01]\n\n“We’re providing the care [residents] need, but we’re also providing them with the engagement and opportunities they’re interested in and passionate about,” says Libbi Hash, national director of wellness and memory care programming at Kisco Senior Living.\n\nMemory care communities even encourage residents’ families to get involved and share their loved one’s interests, abilities, and preferences if their loved one is unable to. This can help communities personalize activity plans to better accommodate each resident.\n\nMany of the following activities can be adapted to engage dementia patients at home. However, memory care communities, care homes, and even some nursing homes provide increased support, supervision, trained professionals, and a range of proper equipment and materials to provide a larger variety of activities in a safe and social manner.\n\nPhysical activities and exercises in memory care\n\nPhysical activity is a crucial factor in improving brain health. It can help improve cognitive function, promote independence, and improve psychological health.[02] It can also reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, mortality, and falls and increase a person’s overall health and longevity.\n\nSome common physical exercises found in a memory care community include:\n\nWalking. Many communities offer walking groups for seniors to join and walk safely on secure and supervised grounds. You can even find scheduled activities where walking is involved, like scavenger hunts and art walks.\n\nGardening. Gardening is a great way to restore dexterity and strength.[03] Some communities offer raised garden beds for seniors to safely continue tending to beloved plants and flowers.\n\nDancing. Communities may host dance classes for residents with varied mobility levels. For example, residents with low mobility are instructed to do simple movements in a chair.\n\nTai chi. Harvard Medical School notes that this exercise can improve cognitive function. It’s also exceptionally easy for individuals with dementia to follow its specific movements.[04]\n\nChair yoga. This exercise is great for those with varying mobility levels since residents do poses and stretches while seated in a chair. It helps with flexibility, strength, and blood flow.\n\nApproximately 70% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network offer a combination of some of the fitness activities listed above.[05]\n\nSocial activities for memory care residents\n\nCognitive impairment from a dementia diagnosis may feel isolating, resulting in anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Therefore, it’s important for seniors to socialize as it can help them feel valued and supported.[06]\n\nProviding a healthy social environment can help seniors with dementia regain a sense of self-worth, have a more positive attitude toward life, and develop better eating and exercise habits.[06]\n\nTo help seniors socialize, memory care staff members often introduce seniors to one another based on their interests. To make introductions natural, staff often encourage residents to sit together during meals or in communal spaces like a courtyard or living area.\n\nCommon social activities include a variety of activities favored by residents of the community:\n\nGame nights. Most communities host game nights or have game rooms to help seniors gather and engage in familiar card, tile, and board games.\n\nMovie nights. Many communities have a theater on-site where residents’ favorite movies are showcased.\n\nIce cream socials. A tasty treat like ice cream can serve as a positive distraction for seniors who aren’t usually sociable. Ice cream can help seniors show enthusiasm or bring back childhood memories, making it easier to spark a conversation.\n\nCooking classes. Some communities help residents follow beloved family recipes to stimulate appetite and utilize aromatherapy and taste therapy. These therapies are especially beneficial because scents and flavors can elicit memory more quickly than sights and sounds. Residents can participate in various ways — they can stick to reading the recipe, observing, or solely coming to relish the finished dish.\n\nInterest clubs or groups. Oftentimes, communities offer clubs for seniors with different interests and capabilities. Popular options include book clubs, walking groups, and gardening clubs.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s memory care network, over 60% of communities offer a gardening club and about 56% of communities offer cooking activities to bring residents together.[05]\n\nRead more: The Benefits of Socialization for Seniors in Senior Living\n\nCreative activities for seniors in memory care\n\nEngaging activities like music lessons and arts and crafts offer a creative outlet for memory care residents, no matter their level of skill or cognitive ability. Studies show that painting, drawing, crafting, musical activities, and even browsing art styles allow freedom of expression and a chance to exercise fine motor skills.[07]\n\nArtistic activities and crafts\n\nArt therapy involves encouraging artistically inclined residents to express themselves using their medium of choice. Artistic expression is known to help soothe dementia symptoms and engage the brain.\n\nMemory care communities may include the following types of arts and crafts in their programming:\n\nCollaging and scrapbooking. Residents cut out pictures from old magazines to create a meaningful or themed collage. They can also use their personal pictures to create a memory scrapbook.\n\nArt shows. This might consist of showing immersive video tours of art museums or slideshows of popular paintings. Some communities may even invite local artists to display their collections in an on-site gallery and allow residents to purchase pieces to hang in their rooms.\n\nPottery or clay projects. Residents can sculpt clay into figurines, decorations like holiday ornaments, or functional objects like pinch pots. The finished pieces might be displayed in common areas or used to decorate a resident’s room.\n\nPainting. Residents can paint on their own in a designated art studio or as a group while following an instructor.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s network, nearly 75% of memory care communities offer arts and crafts activities to help residents engage their creative side.[05]\n\nMusical activities\n\nMusic therapy for dementia involves listening to familiar music to promote reminiscence. It’s known to help enhance memory, reduce agitation, and improve cognition.[08]\n\nTo help seniors reminisce using music, memory care communities typically incorporate the following musical activities:\n\nPlaying classic records. Communities might play classics in the background during other activities like game nights or classes. Or, they may provide a jukebox or CD player with classic tunes in a common area, so residents can listen and reminisce at their leisure.\n\nInstrumental music classes. Memory care residents can attend music lessons to learn new skills, hone old ones, and enjoy themselves. A local musician or the activities director might lead these sessions. These classes are usually designed for all skill levels to participate and include easy-to-use instruments like the triangle or maracas.\n\nKaraoke nights or singalongs. Singing favorite songs or getting together to sing holiday carols or hymns can help promote socialization and joy among residents.\n\nListening to music on a portable music player. Some communities provide residents an easy-to-use music player, like an iPod, loaded with their favorite songs. This allows residents to listen to their tunes whenever they’d like. Oftentimes, family members are involved in suggesting their loved one’s favorite musicians or songs.\n\nNearly 79% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network offer some combination of the musical activities listed above.[05]\n\nIs memory care the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nProductive and meaningful activities\n\n“Everyone has a need to feel useful, no matter what stage of life they’re in,” Hash says.\n\nActivities that help residents reflect and feel productive are crucial in memory care. While productive activities may look different in each community, some of the most common include engaging in life skill stations and daily tasks.\n\nLife skill stations\n\nSince many older adults with dementia mentally revert to a time when they were younger, memory care communities aim to simulate common settings from residents’ pasts. These replications are called autonomous engagement stations — or life skill stations — and they aim to provide a familiar environment for residents to feel safe and reflect.\n\n“If a resident is restless at night and wants to get up, the autonomous areas are a safe setting where they can go and engage in an activity that brings them comfort or a sense of satisfaction,” Hash says.\n\nLife skills stations are built around a specific task or occupation, such as:\n\nOffice work. Residents can sit at a desk stocked with props like a typewriter, phone, notepads, calculator, and stamps.\n\nTinkering. A resident who worked in a skilled trade or enjoyed do-it-yourself home improvement projects might benefit from a simulated workshop setting with blunt tools, smooth wood, and toolboxes.\n\nChildcare. Nurturing dolls increases engagement and communication and reduces symptoms of distress in people with dementia.[09] This station might feature dolls, a crib, bottles, and baby clothes to fold.\n\nPet care. Communities may offer realistic robotic cats or dogs for residents to care for. Interaction with robotic pets has been shown to have similar benefits to therapy with live pets.\n\nDaily tasks\n\nStaff at memory care communities create opportunities for those with dementia to continue to be productive in ways that give them meaning and joy. This approach is sometimes called the Montessori Method or life skills engagement. It involves helping seniors revive skills and interests — even if physical abilities have deteriorated from dementia — rather than redirecting them to easier tasks.\n\nMemory care calendars may include various life skills tasks to help residents feel accomplished and motivated. Examples could include some of the following everyday activities:\n\nHelping others. Residents can help the kitchen staff out by washing vegetables or buttering bread. Or, maybe they could deliver mail to other residents.\n\nCleaning. Sweeping up hallways or wiping tables keeps their shared environment clean.\n\nSetting the table. Making centerpieces for tables in the dining room or setting out the plates can be a satisfying activity for some residents.\n\nCreating something to donate. Some communities may host activities where residents knit, crochet, quilt, or sew items to donate to local organizations, like homeless shelters, hospitals, or animal shelters.\n\nWatering plants. Many memory care communities have plants in shared spaces or courtyards to liven up the environment. Residents can help care for the plants by watering them occasionally.\n\nStimulating activities for memory care residents\n\nAfter a dementia diagnosis, it becomes crucial to identify brain-stimulating activities that work for each unique individual. To engage different parts of the brain in various ways, memory care communities use a variety of cognitive and tactile activities.\n\nStimulating memory games\n\nCognitive stimulation therapy is an evidence-based treatment used in people with mild to moderate dementia.[10] Its goal is to guide people with dementia through a series of themed activities — like memory games — to promote continued learning and improve working memory. Common activities include things like the following:\n\nJigsaw puzzles. Putting together colorful puzzle pieces can improve visual-spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills in dementia patients.\n\nWord search puzzles. This familiar activity can provide comfort and help exercise residents’ brains.\n\nMaze games. Following a maze can help improve fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination in memory care residents.\n\nCard-matching games. Matching shapes, colors, or numbers can help with memory recall and concentration.\n\nDice games. Rolling die can help improve fine motor skills, increase attention span, and help them practice counting.\n\nBingo. This senior-favored game can help memory care residents socialize while promoting their listening skills and hand-eye coordination.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s memory care network, over 55% of communities offer specific brain fitness activities and exercises to help seniors improve cognitive function.[05]\n\nTactile stimulation activities\n\nThe sense of touch can help memory care residents feel joyful and secure, which can in turn soothe some common dementia symptoms.[01] Communities use tactile stimulation in a variety of ways:\n\nSensory bins. These boxes are typically filled with items of different sizes, shapes, materials, and textures designed to provide tactile stimulation. Each bin’s contents may be based on a theme, such as a holiday, a season, a color, or a location.\n\nPlay a guessing game. Encouraging residents to close their eyes and identify an object, like a stuffed bear or wooden spoon, by touch can be fun and engaging.\n\nSort different fabrics. Collecting samples of fabrics like velvet, fur, or silk to sort can be soothing for memory care residents.\n\nPlay with fidgets. Providing a fidget toy or board with knobs, zippers, and unique textures can help keep hands busy and calm dementia patients.\n\nHoliday celebrations in memory care\n\nCelebrating common holidays — and some lesser-known ones like National Flower Day is one way memory care facilities foster community. It can add excitement and variety for residents who don’t get to celebrate holidays the same way they used to.\n\nTo help residents feel included and joyous during mainstream holidays, many memory care communities host fun activities:\n\nDecorating the community. Community staff put up decorations and sometimes allow residents to contribute to spark memories and help them anticipate the upcoming holiday.\n\nHoliday parties. On holidays like Valentine’s Day, Halloween, and Christmas, many communities host parties with themed decorations and snacks to encourage socialization and bring festivities to life. Many communities allow visitors to some events so loved ones can celebrate together.\n\nThemed activities. Oftentimes, communities will add holiday-related variations to common activities. For instance, a Christmas-themed scavenger hunt or a Halloween-themed bingo night.\n\nNontraditional holiday activities. Nowadays, unique holidays, like National Coffee Day or National Watermelon Day, are more popularly celebrated. Communities often incorporate unique tastings or social events to freshen up the calendar.\n\nOver 80% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network host holiday parties and celebrations for residents.[05]\n\nMemory care questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nPet therapy activities\n\nReminiscence activities with loved ones\n\nTechnological activities in memory care\n\nEngaging technology can slow cognitive decline and improve well-being in seniors with dementia.[13] Technology can also help memory care communities appeal to residents’ individual histories and interests.\n\nBelow are three stimulating technologies that memory care communities use to engage seniors with dementia:\n\nWatching live streams or immersive tours. With internet and virtual tours, memory care residents can visit zoos, aquariums, and museums around the world. A group of birdwatchers could enjoy the soothing bird calls of a wildlife preserve, while art lovers may be stimulated by a group “tour” of the Louvre in Paris. Communities may even augment these virtual experiences with props, like binoculars for birdwatchers or a map to simulate museum tours.\n\nParticipating in virtual reality (VR). VR technology can help people with dementia recall past memories, reduce aggression, and improve interactions with caregivers.[14] Many tech-forward memory care communities incorporate VR devices to help residents “visit” favorite places, like the beach or mountains, safely.\n\nEngaging with Snoezelen rooms. Seniors experiencing significant cognitive decline may not be able to participate in activities they enjoyed during the early stages of dementia. Snoezelen rooms use technology to fill a room with sensory stimulants. Common features include projections, aromatherapy devices, sound machines, and light features to help residents fully immerse themselves.\n\nPlaying video games. Some communities offer soothing and engaging video games — like Wii Sports, Candy Crush, or Tetris — to stimulate memory care residents. Video games are proven to improve cognitive health in older adults because of the engagement and memory recall required while playing.[15]\n\nHow memory care communities personalize activities\n\nPerson-centered care for dementia uses personal histories, stories, and interests to help residents thrive in memory care communities. This approach is important when curating memory care programming ideas to help personalize activities based on unique personalities.\n\n“When a new resident moves in, we learn their likes, dislikes, and interests. We create activities and encourage participation based on those passions,” Hash says. “As residents transition through their journey and aren’t as capable, we can modify what they’re doing so they’re still able to participate.”\n\nBy understanding preferences, pasts, and emotional needs, a community can design activities to best fit each resident’s personality, interests, and abilities. Memory care communities consider the group of residents, in addition to individual interests, to create their monthly activities calendar.\n\n“As our resident population changes, so do our autonomous stations, the activities we plan, and even the hours we do things,” Hash explains.\n\nThere are many ways community activities and schedules may vary by resident population:\n\nRural communities may offer activities like canning and vegetable gardening that might not be as popular in large cities.\n\nCommunities with many religious residents may offer more frequent services, devotions, and religious studies throughout the week.\n\nFacilities with residents who worked overnight shifts when they were younger may offer select activities throughout the night.\n\nAutonomous engagement stations can reflect popular local jobs and settings — if many residents were employed by a local store, for example, there could be a simulated environment with a faux cash register or shelves filled with artificial products.\n\nMemory care activities calendar\n\nBefore moving a loved one into memory care, it’s important to get a sense of the activities offered to residents. When touring, ask for the community’s memory care activities calendar. It should include all the activities offered by staff each month, along with the specific times your loved one can expect to participate. Families should also ask how easily their loved one’s interests and hobbies might be able to be incorporated into the monthly schedule.\n\nHere’s a sample memory care activities calendar:\n\nGet help with finding a memory care community\n\nMany families choose a memory care facility based on its robust memory care activity programming.

      "# [A Guide to Assisted Living Regulations by Rebecca Schier-Akamelu on 2024-01-08](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-violations)\nIndividual state agencies — not the federal government — regulate assisted living facilities. In most cases, it’s up to the state health or social services department to regulate assisted living communities, sometimes referred to as “residential care settings” or “residential assisted living facilities.”\n\nAssisted living communities and residential care settings provide the following:\n\nHousing and meals\n\nSupportive services\n\nPersonalized assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nMedication management\n\nMinor health care, generally excluding hospital-level care\n\nIn your senior living search, you may come across residential care homes, sometimes called “personal care homes” or “board and care homes.” These homes are similar to larger assisted living facilities, although they have a more homelike environment with fewer residents. Typically, the same state agency is also in charge of regulating these care homes, as they’re a form of assisted living.\n\nIn some states, residential care homes may be licensed as an assisted living facility. In other states, there may be more of a distinction between assisted living and residential care homes, usually centering on the number of residents.\n\nAre assisted living facilities and nursing homes regulated the same way?\n\nNursing homes and assisted living communities are different, both in the level of care they offer and in the way they are regulated. Nursing homes are regulated at the federal level. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates and provides ratings for nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities. If you’re searching for a nursing home, you can view the audit and licensing history of Medicare-approved nursing homes on the Medicare website.\n\nNursing homes offer 24/7 care for seniors who need a high-level of medical oversight due to a serious or chronic health condition. Unlike assisted living, nursing home care is based on a medical model. Typically, a doctor needs to prescribe a nursing-home level of care before a senior is admitted as a full-time resident. A senior who doesn’t quite need this level of care may be better suited for assisted living.\n\nWho regulates memory care facilities?\n\nThe same state department that regulates assisted living communities typically licenses memory care communities. Most of the time, memory care is licensed as a specialized form of assisted living. If your loved one is experiencing memory loss, you may find communities that offer both assisted living and memory care on the same campus.\n\nIn this multi-care setting, the memory care area of a community will typically have additional security features for residents. Many states also have additional training requirements for caregivers working with people who have Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia. Again, these regulations and training requirements will vary depending on the state you live in.\n\nTypically, requirements for assisted living communities offering memory care focus on:\n\nFeatures of a memory care unit or apartment\n\nStaff-to-resident ratios\n\nStaff training\n\nBehavior management methods\n\nWhen applying for licensure, memory care communities often must provide a disclosure form describing how they meet these requirements.[01]\n\nYes — before opening, assisted living communities must have a license from the proper state agency. The agency then proceeds to inspect or survey each community on a routine basis to maintain its license. Inspections usually occur both annually and when someone files a complaint.\n\nTo obtain a license, an assisted living community has to show that they meet the rules and regulations established on the state, local, and municipal level. This could include rules set by any of the following agencies:[01]\n\nThe office of sanitation\n\nThe office of public health\n\nThe office of the state fire marshal\n\nThe city fire department\n\nThe local zoning or permit office\n\nOnce a community is licensed, it’ll receive regular inspections. Many states conduct these annually, and in many cases inspections are unscheduled. If a community has a reported violation, they’ll receive more frequent inspections, and the state can impose a penalty or even revoke a facility’s license if they fail to make corrections.[01]\n\nRegulations vary from state to state. Some common state regulations include:\n\nThe type of training staff is required to receive\n\nWhat must be covered in the initial service agreement\n\nWhich staff members can provide medical services\n\nWhen an initial care assessment should take place\n\nHow often care plans are reassessed\n\nCaregiver-to-resident ratios or caregiver hours in relation to facility size\n\nStandards for community cleanliness\n\nUpdated medical records\n\nIt’s important to note that although state-specific regulations may overlap with broader assisted living regulations, the specifics of the requirements can vary considerably. Researching the regulations specific to your state can help you to better understand what’s required of a prospective community and how to identify potential red flags during a tour.\n\nHow do I report a violation of assisted living regulations?\n\nIf you suspect that a community isn’t complying with state guidelines for cleanliness or care, or even neglect or elder abuse, contact the state’s Adult Protective Services (APS) agency. This listing of APS agencies by state provides contact information. You can also contact the licensing organization in your state, which you can find listed on a community’s license. Many assisted living facilities are required to post these licenses in a public area according to state regulations.",
      "# [Home Care vs. Home Health Care by Haleigh Behrman on 2024-07-12](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/home-care-vs-home-health-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nHome care supports seniors aging in place by providing services like help with bathing, dressing, and companionship.\n\nHome health care is medically necessary care prescribed by a doctor, such as skilled nursing care, health monitoring, and medication administration.\n\nThe national median cost of home care is $30 per hour, and in most cases, seniors or their families pay for home care out of pocket.\n\nWhat is home care?\n\nHome care — sometimes called “in-home care” — means nonmedical services for seniors who require assistance with daily tasks. Levels of care can vary based on a senior’s specific needs, while the frequency may range from daily to weekly visits to provide the following services:\n\nCompanionship\n\nHomemaker services\n\nTransportation\n\nPersonal care\n\nHelp with activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nHome care providers, who are sometimes referred to as “personal care aides,” can be hired privately or through a home care agency.\n\nHome care benefits\n\nHome care aides can free up time for overwhelmed family caregivers and provide support for seniors who want to age in place but need:\n\nCompanionship\n\nHelp with cooking, cleaning, and other household duties\n\nTransportation to and from activities and appointments\n\nHelp with personal care tasks\n\nWhat is home health care?\n\nHome health care is prescribed by a doctor as part of a patient’s care plan. Services are provided in a patient’s home by licensed medical professionals.\n\nHome health care is typically arranged and provided through home health agencies and may include the following services:\n\nSkilled nursing care provided by a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical nurse (LPN), such as wound care, medication administration, and medical testing\n\nSkilled therapy provided by a physical, occupational, or speech therapist[01]\n\nAssistance at home with recovery after a stroke or hip replacement surgery.\n\nIf a senior’s doctor prescribes home health care, if necessary, they may also include home care services in the senior’s care. In that case, while they recover at home, they may also receive services like support with ADLs or help with housekeeping\n\nThe benefits of home health care\n\nHome health care benefits someone who has challenging medical needs or is recovering from an injury or illness. This could include seniors who:\n\nNeed monitoring after a medication change\n\nExperience an overall decline in function and require rehabilitative therapies to regain their independence\n\nHave recently been discharged from rehabilitation, the hospital, or a skilled nursing facility\n\nCan’t travel to and from doctors’ offices safely due to fragile health conditions\n\nIs home care the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nComparing home care and home health care services\n\nThe following chart compares the services that are provided by home care and home health care. However, keep in mind that nonmedical and medical home-based services can be combined to provide a senior with comprehensive support.\n\nHome-based serviceHome careHome healthBathing/dressing assistanceYesNoBathroom supportYesSometimesCleaningYesNoCompanionshipYesNoHealth monitoringNoYesInjections and IV therapiesNoYesMeal prep or deliveryYesNoMedical testsNoYesMedication administrationNoYesMedication remindersYesYesPain managementNoYesRehabilitative therapiesNoYesSkilled nursingNoYesTransportationYesNoWound careNoYes\n\nThe costs of home care and home health care\n\nHome care and home health care offer different levels of care, which are reflected in the different costs families should expect to pay for each care type.\n\nCost of home care\n\nThe national median cost of home care in 2023 is $30 per hour, based on proprietary data gathered from A Place for Mom’s home care provider network.[02] Factors such as location, state wage laws, and agency requirements can affect the cost of home care near you.\n\nRead more:How Much Does In-Home Care Cost in 2024? A State-by-State Guide\n\nCost of home health care\n\nThe amount a family will pay for home health care depends on the type of insurance they have and the level of care their loved one needs. Because home health care services are typically prescribed by a doctor, Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance plans will usually cover at least some of these costs if certain eligibility criteria are met.\n\nAny needed durable medical equipment is often included in addition to services like injections, wound care, and physical and occupational therapy. Home health care providers may also assist individuals with ADLs and other homemaking tasks if these services are part of a senior’s care plan.[01]\n\nOut-of-pocket home health care expenses are usually higher than home care expenses because the services provided are specialized and are provided by licensed medical professionals. However, the costs can vary by location, services, and the level of care required.\n\nPaying for home-based care\n\nThe following list highlights the most common payment methods and the types of home care they cover.\n\nPrivate pay is the most common way families pay for nonmedical home care. For home health care, this method is only necessary when a senior doesn’t have health insurance or meet the eligibility requirements for other types of coverage.\n\nLong-term care insurance typically covers nonmedical in-home care and home health care, but policies vary.\n\nPrivate health insurance plans may cover some of the cost of medically necessary home health care services, but they generally don’t cover personal care services.\n\nMedicare covers home health care if a doctor certifies that a beneficiary is homebound and has a medical need for intermittent skilled services. Some nonmedical home care services may be covered, but only if a doctor recommends them in addition to home health services in a patient’s care plan.\n\nMedicaid covers home health care services in all states for seniors who qualify. Many states have expanded access to home-based care options, including nonmedical home care services. However, coverage and eligibility requirements vary by state, and some programs may have wait lists.\n\nHome care questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nFinding home health and home care services\n\nYour loved one’s doctor or hospital social worker will likely be the main resource for finding home health care services. They’ll either arrange services through a Medicare-certified home health agency or furnish a list of providers to contact directly.\n\nIf home care is the right fit for your loved one, you have the option to hire an independent caregiver on your own or hire caregivers through a home care agency. Both approaches have pros and cons, but hiring independently often requires a family to be fully involved in every step of the process. An agency is typically more expensive, but their staff handles things like background checks, taxes and payroll, and finding replacement care when it’s needed.\n\nA Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help you explore home-based care options at no cost to your family. They can answer your questions about home care, assess your loved one’s needs, and guide you through the next steps of your search.",
      "# [Questions to Ask Assisted Living Facilities When Touring by Rebecca Schier-Akamelu on 2024-07-29](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/choosing-the-right-assisted-living-facility)\nKey Takeaways\n\nTours are an ideal time to ask questions as you’ll have many staff members to talk to.\n\nPlan to ask about many topics during your tour, including care needs and pricing.\n\nTrack answers for each community you tour to help you compare them later.\n\nStaff may have questions for you, which is a good sign that they’re doing their best to make sure this is a good fit.\n\nAsk questions during assisted living tours to find a good fit\n\nHaving questions ready can help ensure your loved one’s care needs and personal lifestyle preferences will be met in their new assisted living community. Knowing what to look for before moving in can help avoid future dissatisfaction, which could ultimately result in another move for your loved one.\n\nAsk assisted living facilities about these topics during a tour\n\nYour questions during a tour should cover the following topics:\n\nPricing\n\nFloor plans\n\nAmenities and services\n\nProgramming and activities\n\nLevels of care\n\nCaregiver training\n\nStaff friendliness\n\nStaff-to-resident ratio\n\nCommunity culture\n\nSpeak with department heads and more\n\nAny staff member leading the tour should be able to answer any questions or direct you to another staff member who can. Some communities have designated tour guides while others may have the community director or a caregiver conduct tours. Note that the staff you will have access to during a tour will vary from community to community.\n\nRachel Levy has helped many families through the touring process. Before joining A Place for Mom, she gained 20 years of experience in management roles and as a sales director in senior living communities.\n\n“You want to make sure you’re speaking to as many department heads as possible,” Levy recommends. “They’re the ones day in and day out who will oversee your loved one’s care. If your sales director [or other tour guide] doesn’t do this automatically, then you need to ask. Key positions to speak to are the executive director and nursing director, but the maintenance and food service director can also add insights.”\n\nThe more people you talk to, the better view of a facility you’ll have. Ask your tour guide who will be available to speak with. You can even try asking if you can talk to a current resident about their experience.\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nAsk assisted living facilities these critical questions\n\nBelow, we’ve categorized several questions for assisted living interviews into lists to help you get all the necessary answers. As you navigate assisted living options, remember that every question is worth asking, even if you feel like it’s naïve or too specific. All details matter when choosing an assisted living facility for a loved one.\n\n“I welcomed all questions since most of the time it was the first time a family experienced senior living,” Levy says.\n\nWhat measures are taken to foster a safe, clean, and comfortable environment?\n\nIt’s important to learn how a facility maintains cleanliness, stays up-to-date on regulations, and ensures safety standards are always met. To get the specifics on how facilities foster a safe environment, try asking the following questions:\n\nWhat are the safety features (e.g., handrails, grab bars, and zero-threshold showers) throughout the community?\n\nWhat accessibility features (e.g., elevators, widened doors, stair lifts, and wheelchair ramps) are located throughout the community?\n\nAre all exits clearly marked?\n\nIs the common area décor intentional? Does it promote comfort and nostalgia (e.g., uplifting colors, art, and comfortable furniture)?\n\nHow often are the common areas cleaned and the grounds maintained?\n\nDoes the facility undergo regular inspections? If so, by which departments (e.g., the state’s health or social services department), and what was the facility’s most recent rating?\n\nHow are caregivers trained and equipped to handle residents’ unique needs?\n\nAn inside look at the caregiver hiring, training, and assigning process can help you assess how personalized the care is and how caregivers there foster nurturing relationships. To help you get an idea of the facility’s caregiving staff, try asking the following:\n\nDo staff members make you feel welcome? Do they call residents by their names?\n\nWhat is the caregiver-to-resident ratio? How many residents live here?\n\nHow many caregivers and staff members are on duty overnight versus during the day?\n\nWhat kind of experience and training does the staff have?\n\nHow does the community facilitate a good match between caregivers and residents?\n\nDoes the community perform background checks on every employee?\n\nWhat is the staff turnover rate? Is the staff tenured?\n\nDoes the community have a registered nurse, licensed vocational nurse, or certified nursing assistant on staff 24/7?\n\nDo caregivers administer medications?\n\nAre caregivers able to meet the scheduled and unscheduled needs of residents?\n\nCan residents contact an on-site or on-call doctor, nurse, or other licensed health care professional during emergencies?\n\nDo caregivers assist with activities of daily living (ADLs)? If so, what does that include (e.g., bathing, dressing, feeding, mobility, etc.)?\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nHow does the facility coordinate access to on-site and off-site health care services?\n\nIf your loved one’s been diagnosed with a complex health condition, it’s crucial to ask any prospective community about their available health care and transportation services. Levy encourages families to ask as many questions as they want about the care provided in the community and to be forthcoming with their loved one’s needs.\n\n“Don’t feel like you need to hold back details,” she says. “It’s really important to be honest since communities are not alike. It will only help a community to determine if your family member is a good fit.”\n\nHealth care questions could include the following:\n\nAre physical and health assessments performed on residents prior to admission?\n\nDoes each resident have a written plan of care? If so, how often is it updated?\n\nDoes the facility’s care assessment include the resident, their family, the facility staff, and the resident’s doctors?\n\nWhat’s the medication management policy? Is self-administration of medication allowed?\n\nAre there any additional care services or therapies available on-site to accommodate changing needs (e.g., hospice care, memory care, physical therapy, etc.)?\n\nAre caregivers or on-site health care professionals equipped to provide care for residents diagnosed with different medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic arthritis, etc.)?\n\nWho coordinates home health care visits from nurses, doctors, physical therapists, etc., if needed?\n\nIs there a clear procedure for responding to a resident’s medical emergency?\n\nIs transportation offered to residents for doctor’s appointments? If so, is the transportation staff-coordinated and wheelchair-friendly? Are mobility escorts available?\n\nAre there any reasons that a resident might need to move to a higher level of care that wouldn’t be able to be managed by the community?\n\nWill they allow seniors who are already receiving hospice services to move in? Are there any limitations to working with seniors receiving hospice services?\n\nHow does the facility enable residents to lead active and engaging lifestyles?\n\nLearn how a facility helps residents stay physically, mentally, and socially active and involved within the community, so that you can be sure your loved one will have plenty of engaging options. Find out how an assisted living facility accommodates your loved one’s hobbies and interests by asking the following:\n\nAre residents happy or satisfied with their lifestyle? How do you measure resident satisfaction?\n\nDo residents have a voice? Can they suggest new activities, clubs, or events?\n\nAre residents actively encouraged to participate in activities?\n\nWhat types of activities are available to residents? How often do they occur? Is there a calendar of events?\n\nIs live entertainment provided? If so, what kind and how often?\n\nWhat amenities are there (e.g., media center, fitness center, spa, barber shop, etc.)?\n\nWhat common spaces are available (e.g., dining rooms, lounges, game rooms, event halls, etc.) to encourage gathering?\n\nWhat outdoor spaces (e.g., walking paths, secured courtyards, and gardens) does the community have?\n\nAre there any shared community animals, such as dogs, cats, birds, or fish?\n\nIs there a place where residents can do their own gardening, arts and crafts, or other personal hobbies?\n\nDoes the facility collaborate with the surrounding community for events (e.g., local libraries, parks and rec, colleges, etc.)?\n\nDo residents go on regular outings, or do volunteers come into the community?\n\nDoes the community offer any religious services on-site or transportation to services in the area? Does the community have any affiliations with a particular religion, like Catholic assisted living? Or is there a large group of residents who share a common religion on-site?\n\nOf course, the people who may give the best insights about community life are the residents themselves. If you see residents during your tour, either in passing or while sampling a meal, ask them about their experiences.\n\nRead more: Senior Living and Socialization: How Social Engagement in Communities Benefits Health\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: SEEING RESIDENTS ON TOUR\n\nMost of the time if residents are happy, they’ll even come and interrupt your tour to tell [you] how happy they are. As a former sales director, I’d always love it when residents did that.\n\nAssisted living questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nWhat kind of dining services does the facility offer?\n\nTo address how your loved one’s dietary needs and tastes will be met, it’s important to ask about on-site dining services. Depending on a senior’s needs and preferences, you can try asking the following:\n\nHow many meals are provided per day, and are mealtimes set?\n\nDoes the menu change daily? Is the food prepared daily?\n\nCan meals be tailored to a resident’s specific dietary needs, restrictions, or special requests?\n\nAre residents permitted to keep or cook food in their apartments?\n\nCan you sample meals during a tour?\n\nAre special meals prepared for specific holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions?\n\nDoes the community provide snacks throughout the day? What kind?\n\nIs there a café for snacks, drinks, and treats?\n\nRead more:Dishing Up the Facts About Assisted Living Menus and Dining Options\n\nHow does the facility accommodate residents’ unique living preferences?\n\nEvery senior leads a unique lifestyle, and it’s important for communities to account for that in as many ways as possible. See how the community can accommodate your loved one’s living preferences by asking the following:\n\nWhat floor plans are available? What’s the monthly cost per layout type?\n\nDo residents have the option of a private or shared room?\n\nAre couples allowed to live together? If so, how do they accommodate elderly couples?\n\nAre furnishings provided? If so, what types?\n\nCan residents personalize and decorate their own units?\n\nDoes each unit have a private bathroom, or are the bathrooms shared?\n\nIs each unit and bathroom designed to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers?\n\nAre there in-unit kitchens or kitchenettes? Is there a refrigerator, sink, or other cooking appliances?\n\nDoes each unit have good natural lighting?\n\nIs temperature controllable? If not, how is it maintained to help ensure residents’ comfort?\n\nDoes each unit have a 24-hour emergency response system?\n\nIs housekeeping offered? If so, does it include linen or laundry service?\n\nAre pets allowed to live in-unit? If so, is there a weight or breed restriction?\n\nHow do costs and fees vary in the community?\n\nCost is perhaps one of the most important factors in choosing an assisted living facility. Be upfront with questions about monthly costs, additional fees, and financing options in order to avoid potential hidden fees or a future increase in costs. Levy encourages families not to shy away from the financial questions, as these can affect your loved one now and in the years to come.\n\n“Rents typically increase at a senior living community just like they do at apartment buildings. Don’t be afraid to ask about that,” she says.\n\nImportant cost- and finance-related questions include the following:\n\nIs a contractual agreement available that discloses all health care and supportive service fees, as well as admission and discharge fees?\n\nWhat are the policies for refunds and transfers?\n\nWhat are the billing and payment policies?\n\nAre all services included in the monthly fee?\n\nWhat services aren’t covered by baseline costs (e.g., housekeeping, medication management, transportation, etc.)? How much are extras?\n\nAre hygiene supplies included in the monthly price? If not, what’s the cost for such items (like incontinence items)?\n\nDoes rent increase on a yearly basis, or is a rent-lock program in place?\n\nIs there a requirement for renter’s insurance? If so, what must be included in a policy?\n\nDoes the community help coordinate with any public programs that may help cover the cost of care services to the resident (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, etc.)?\n\nIs there a process for dissatisfied residents to file complaints?\n\nIs there a process for a resident to appeal a care decision that affects them?\n\nAre there any pricing incentives or move-in specials available?\n\nQuestions should go both ways\n\nDuring a tour, it’s normal for your guide to ask you questions as well. In fact, it’s a good sign.\n\n“As a sales director, it was my job to help our customers open up. I’d really focus on [asking] open-ended questions like, ‘What worries you the most right now?’ or ‘What do you think will happen if you don’t make a decision?’” Levy recalls. “I found that families opened up if I told them from the start that I’d be asking a lot of questions since it will help me help them. I always listened for emotional words and then asked them to tell me more.”\n\nThe more questions your tour guide and others in the community ask your family, the better. It shows that they care about your loved one and want to help make sure that the community will be a good fit for them.\n\nPrepare to tour multiple assisted living communities\n\nWhen selecting the right community for your loved one, you’ll want to do everything you can to make sure you find the right fit. From location to budget and lifestyle, you’ll have many factors to consider.\n\nOf all the families we’ve helped at A Place for Mom, half were referred to between four and six communities.[01] (We refer families to partner communities that would be a good fit for their loved one.) In order to keep the communities clear in your mind, Levy recommends spacing out tours.\n\nShe also recommends keeping in touch with any communities you tour.\n\n“It’s typical that a community will follow up with you after a,tour. I encourage you to take their calls and give them honest feedback.” Levy recommends. If something didn’t feel right, let them know. If you need a second tour, ask for it. It’s a big decision, and the more interaction you have with a community, the more likely you’ll know what to expect when you move in.”\n\nKeep track of answers from your assisted living interviews with our checklist\n\nKeeping track of details can be tough. They can easily get jumbled among your thoughts or in your notes, especially when you’re visiting multiple assisted living communities.\n\nTo help you stay organized, we’ve compiled a handy checklist for assisted living facility tours (it’s the questions above in PDF format). You can print out multiple copies — one for each community you visit — to keep track of the answers across each tour. At the end of all the tours, you can compare and contrast your notes to help you and your loved one make an informed decision.\n\nAnd, of course, you can always talk to a Senior Living Advisor at A Place for Mom. They’ll work with you to help find communities that fit your loved one’s lifestyle and budget. Plus they can help schedule tours for you. They’re a wonderful resource and offer advice as you navigate assisted living solutions near you, all at no cost to you.\n\nOriginal article by A Place for Mom senior copywriter Nirali Desai.\n\nWhat families are saying about assisted living facilities\n\nAssisted living reviews from residents and families\n\nStoryPoint Schererville\n\n5.0\n\nThe staff is very considerate of my parent needs.

      "# [What Are Activities of Daily Living and How Are They Assessed? by Nirali Desai on 2024-07-10](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/adls-iadls)\nKey Takeaways\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs) are basic tasks a person has to do on their own to live independently, such as bathing, showering, dressing, and mobility.\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex activities a person does to care for themselves and their home, including cleaning, managing money or medications, shopping, and preparing meals.\n\nAssess your loved one’s ability to perform ADLS and IADLs using checklists to monitor any changes to their abilities.\n\nConsider a professional opinion or senior support options if you notice changes in a senior’s abilities to complete ADLs and IADLs.\n\nWhat are ADLs and IADLs?\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs) are basic tasks needed for everyday life, while instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex tasks needed to function independently and manage one’s own affairs.\n\nResearch shows that individuals over age 85 generally need assistance with daily living, with more than 20% of seniors over 85 requiring help with ADLs.[01]\n\nActivities of daily living examples\n\nHere’s a standard list of activities of daily living, as outlined by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living:[02]\n\nBathing and showering — the ability to bathe and maintain personal hygiene\n\nContinence — having complete control of the bowels and bladder\n\nDressing — the ability to select appropriate clothes and outerwear for the weather or occasion and get dressed independently\n\nMobility — the ability to walk or transfer from one place to another, specifically in and out of a bed or chair\n\nFeeding (excluding meal preparation) — the ability to get food from plate to mouth and to chew and swallow\n\nToileting — the ability to get on and off the toilet and clean oneself without assistance\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living examples\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) require planning, problem-solving, and organizational skills. While ADLs are very fundamental, IADLs are skills that allow seniors to function independently and manage their own affairs. IADLs, as outlined by the Lawton-Brody scale, include the following:[03]\n\nHousekeeping and home maintenance — the ability to maintain a clean and safe home by mopping, doing laundry, or fixing minor things\n\nManaging money — the ability to budget and pay bills on time\n\nManaging medications — taking medications correctly and refilling them on time\n\nPreparing meals — the ability to plan, cook, and serve one’s own meals\n\nShopping for groceries and other necessities — remembering to get all the things one needs to eat and live properly on time\n\nTransportation — the ability to get around by driving oneself, arranging a pickup, or using public transportation\n\nUsing the phone or computer — the ability to answer phone calls, call others, or email others, if it’s something one has always done\n\nHow are ADLs and IADLs assessed?\n\nCaregivers can assess ADLs and IADLs in a variety of ways. You can use health care professional assessments, use caregiver input, or simply ask your loved one whether they’ve noticed changes in their abilities.\n\nProfessional ADL assessments\n\nHealth care professionals typically use one of the following three types of ADL assessments:\n\nThe Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living. This is generally for seniors in long-term care settings, where disability is generally more severe but stable. In this assessment, one point is gained for each ADL your loved one can complete independently. The total number of points at the end of the assessment shows how independent your loved one is and what level of assistance they may need.[02]\n\nThe Barthel ADL Index. This assessment covers two additional activities, including grooming and ability to climb stairs. It’s also for care settings and can detect subtle changes in a person’s health. In this assessment, the task levels are on a scaled point system. As with the Katz assessment, the more points you have in total, the more independent your loved one likely is.[04]\n\nThe Functional Independence Measure (FIM). This option is more comprehensive, combining ADLs with IADLs and other social activities. This assessment tool comprises 18 items divided into physical and mental categories. Each item is scored on a scale. The higher the score, the more independent your loved one is at performing the task.[05]\n\nCaregiver input\n\nCaregiver input can help create a bigger picture of your loved one’s functional abilities. Family or hired caregivers often notice when a senior needs more assistance than they used to. For example, a parent may start asking for help in situations they could once tackle alone.\n\nEXPERT TIPS: SIGNS IT'S TIME TO ASSESS ADLS AND IADLS\n\n• Pay attention to their driving habits. See if there are any signs of accidents or close calls, or if passengers feel worried when riding with them.\n\n• Check for health concerns. They may be more prone to falls or have had repeated trips to the ER or hospital recently.\n\n• Watch for signs of financial struggles. Look for unpaid bills or bounced checks sitting out, or for declined transactions when you’re out together.\n\n• Notice trouble with their memory. They may be forgetting important things or using poor judgment, which can put them in danger.\n\nSelf-reporting\n\nSelf-reporting can also help get the conversation about ADLs and IADLs started. No one understands a situation better than the person experiencing it.\n\nSelf-reporting is especially helpful when individuals have minimal cognitive decline. A senior may be more honest about their struggles or remember situations better if their memory is working well. Keep in mind that self-reporting can introduce bias, as your loved one may not feel an incident is worth recording when it really is.\n\nProfessional opinion\n\nFamilies rarely ask about ADLs until a parent or senior loved one is going through the process of assessment for long-term care, says Dr. Leslie Kernisan, a geriatrician. According to Kernisan, it’s a good idea to share changes in ADLs or IADLs with your loved one’s medical team. Often, a change in a senior’s ability to perform them requires evaluations that may uncover a medical issue. This can help doctors identify the root cause of the problem or change in ability.\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSESSING ADLS\n\nIf someone is concerned about their mom, then knowing how they’re doing with ADLs is important. It can educate a person and take them from feeling like ‘Mom needs help, I’m worried,’ to be able to answer questions like, ‘OK, where does she need help?’\n\nUnderstanding the root cause can help your doctor identify ways to improve function, including medical treatment, mobility devices, and various therapies. A deeper understanding of your loved one’s ability to perform ADLs and IADLs can also help doctors create an accurate care plan that supports their needs.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nUse our ADL checklists to monitor your loved one\n\nTo help you assess and monitor your loved one’s activities of daily living, use A Place for Mom’s ADL and IADL checklists. After assessing your loved one, consider taking the results with you the next time your loved one has a medical checkup.\n\nClick on the respective images below to download the ADL and IADL checklists.\n\nTips for assessing your loved one’s ADLS and IADLs\n\nAs you assess your loved one’s ability to complete ADLs and IADLs, follow these tips:\n\nAsk for other opinions. Check with your loved one’s neighbors, family, and friends. Inquire about any changes in your loved one’s abilities. Pick two or three people to discuss your concerns with.\n\nAssess on a spectrum. Ask yourself whether your loved one can do the task a little bit, sometimes, or often rather than a simple “yes, they can do the task,” or “no, they can’t.”\n\nBe patient with slow activities. “If a person is doing a task more slowly than they used to, it doesn’t mean they can’t do the task,” Kernisan notes.\n\nConsider the time of day and how tired they are. Many seniors have sharper cognitive abilities and more energy in the morning.\n\nConsider their health. If they’re fatigued or fighting a virus, your loved one’s abilities can be momentarily impaired.\n\nFind the time. “It’s common to be in a hurry, and it’s difficult to find the time to observe, but it’s important to take the time, and when you do, be patient,” Kernisan says.\n\nLook at your own preconceived notions about your loved one. Are they interfering with your ability to make an objective assessment?\n\nMake the effort to help correct what you can. Ensure your loved one can live life to the best of their abilities and as independently as possible.\n\n“It’s very challenging to have people see you as less able,” Kernisan says. Family caregivers should “be discreet and empathetic” when assessing for ADLs and IADLs, she suggests.\n\nIf your loved one is unable to independently perform daily ADLs and IADLs, or if you have other safety concerns, it may be time to discuss senior care. Increasing support with home care or moving to an assisted living community can help them to live safely and continue their activities with assistance.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps: Determining level of care\n\nHow senior living can help with ADLs\n\nIf you’re worried about your loved one’s ability to perform everyday tasks, connect with their doctor to discuss your concerns. It’s important to identify any limitations your aging parent may have, but it’s even more critical to support them by finding solutions to help solve or alleviate those limitations. If your loved one needs help with even one ADL, assisted living or home care services could be helpful possibilities to consider.\n\nBy definition, assisted living communities offer residents assistance with ADLs and some IADLs. Here are some specific ADLs and IADLs that assisted living communities within A Place for Mom’s network help with:[06]\n\nOver 95% of communities provide meals.\n\nNearly 88% of communities offer incontinence care.\n\nAlmost 83% of communities offer medication management services.\n\nOver 80% of communities offer housekeeping services.\n\nAbout 77% of communities offer laundry or dry-cleaning services.\n\nOver 85% of communities offer transportation services.\n\nIf you’re ready to explore senior support options, reach out to one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors. At no cost to your family, an advisor will work to understand your parent’s unique situation and needs, compare different senior living options, and offer personalized referrals.",
      "# [22 Top Caregiver Support Groups: Online and In by Anna Nichols on 2024-01-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/caregiver-support-groups)\nIn 2023, 41.8 million people provided unpaid care for a loved one in the United States, according to the Caregiving in the U.S. 2020 Report published by The National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) and AARP.[01] This represents one of the biggest unspoken challenges for Americans, and as the Baby Boomer generation continues to age, the number of caregivers experiencing these challenges will continue to rise. Most of these caregivers are daughters or sons who live near their parents. They provide on average 24 hours of care a week on top of their own careers and other responsibilities.\n\nFor caregivers who live with their ailing loved ones, this number goes up to about 37 hours a week of unpaid labor. It comes as no surprise that 82% of caregivers say that their physical and mental well-being is jeopardized by their caregiving duties. 76% of family caregivers say they were not prepared to take on these responsibilities.[02]\n\nCaregivers of elderly loved ones can feel pulled in two different directions. 36% of caregivers are between the ages of 50 and 64 — a group sometimes called the Sandwich Generation — and many have adult children and grandchildren to support in addition to their own parents. The financial strain of caregiving is another stressor, with families spending on average $7,242 a year on expenses related to caregiving.[02]\n\nMany caregiver support groups have sprung up in response to this increasingly widespread challenge. As of 2023, 1 in 5 American adults are now providing care to an elderly person, and most feel a need for advice, support, and empathy. These caregiver support groups are a place to start if you’re new to caregiving, or if you’ve been providing care for a long time and need encouragement.\n\nOnline caregiver support groups are a helpful way to learn about a wide range of experiences and connect with caregivers who don’t live near you. For those in rural communities, these can be especially useful. Almost all of these online support groups are on Facebook, so you’ll need to know how to join an online Facebook group to participate.\n\nOnline memory caregiver support groups\n\nIt can be helpful to know you are not alone. Learning about caregiver statistics and joining a dementia-care forum can help you better understand your community of caregivers. It’s also important to prioritize self-care as a caregiver, which can include building supportive relationships with other caregivers.\n\nMemory People. If your loved one has Alzheimer’s, another form of dementia, or other memory-impairment illnesses, Memory People may be a helpful group to join. This private Facebook group was created by Alzheimer’s patient Rick Phelps as a way for dementia patients and caregivers to share their stories and find understanding.\n\nDementia Caregivers Support Group. Dementia Caregivers Support Group is another private Facebook group that also supports caregivers of those affected by Alzheimer’s and dementia. It seeks “to stimulate conversation and ensure all members a safe haven in posting personal feelings.”\n\nThe Purple Sherpa Basecamp (Dementia Family Caregiver Support Group). Created by the daughter and primary caregiver of an Alzheimer’s patient, this support group targets people caring for those with memory-impairment illnesses. It allows caregivers “to vent and support one another, and to break the silence that leaves so many caregivers feeling alone.”\n\nAlzheimer’s and Dementia Caregivers Support Chat Group. This chat group supports friends, family, and caregivers of Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. The members value brutal honesty and occasional humor during discussions. If you’re focused strictly on gaining information regarding memory care, this group may not be the right fit.\n\nDementia Caregivers Support Group. A dementia patient’s daughter-in-law, who also served as primary caregiver, created this dementia caregiver support group. Caregivers in this group — which now has more than a whopping 43,000 members — support each other by posting caregiving suggestions, ways to de-stress, and new discoveries in dementia treatments and preventions.\n\nCaring for Spouse with Dementia. A dementia caregiver support group that offers understanding from a specialized point of view. It’s a growing and helpful resource for those who are caregiving and also coming to terms with their spouse’s condition.\n\nOnline support groups for family caregivers\n\nServing as a primary caregiver for an aging loved one can take a toll. These online support groups for family caregivers can help by offering stories, advice, and sympathy.\n\nAgingCare’s Caregiver Forum. Caregiving questions of all sorts are quickly answered on this active forum, or message board, from A Place for Mom’s partner site, AgingCare. Users can select from three separate tabs: Recent Activity, Most Popular, and Needs Answers. Anyone can read the Q&As though you must sign up to post your own questions or answers.\n\nCaregiver Support Community. Caregiver Support Community is a welcoming and supportive group intended for family caregivers — not for professional caregivers, nursing home workers, former caregivers, or anyone selling products or services. Before you join, the group asks you to share your caregiving story.\n\nCaring for Elderly Parents. The organizers of this group recognize caring for your elderly parent may be one of the hardest situations you’ve ever faced. To ease this stress, the group gives members a place to ask questions, vent, or simply be heard.\n\nWorking Daughter. Working Daughter is a space for women struggling to balance caregiving with a career and raising children. With more than 4,000 members, this group provides resources for women “searching for real world, practical answers” about juggling all of life’s responsibilities.\n\nCaregivers of Narcissistic Family Members. This support group is a safe place for caregivers to freely discuss the challenges of caring for a narcissistic family member. Group members provide suggestions and helpful tips to improve the health of both the caregiver as well as the senior loved one.\n\nFamily Caregiver Alliance (FCA). FCA’s online caregiver support group focuses on family caregivers for patients with both physical and cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s, stroke, Parkinson’s, and brain injuries. It also offers forums for LGBTQ+ caregivers and young adult caregivers. This FCA group offers “a safe place to discuss the stresses, challenges, and rewards of providing care for a loved one.”\n\nCaregivers Connect. Caregivers Connect allows the voices of family caregivers to be heard. This support group aims to inspire caregivers and provide helpful resources to better care for senior loved ones. It welcomes new people and encourages members to invite anyone who may benefit from these discussions.\n\nYou can find caregiver support groups near you by contacting your local Area Agency on Aging, by asking caregivers you already know, or by reviewing the list below. Some people find connecting face-to-face, regularly or occasionally, to be more therapeutic than online support groups. Also, many in-person support groups focus on specific conditions and circumstances. Peers from local support groups may also be able to offer more tangible support.\n\nBest in-person support groups for caregivers\n\nThese in-person support groups are all offered through national organizations. You can find the nearest local group to you on their websites.\n\nAlzheimer’s Association. The Alzheimer’s Association’s map feature helps locate Alzheimer’s caregiver support groups nearest you. The meetings are facilitated by trained leaders.\n\nNational Stroke Association. The National Stroke Association has a Stroke Support Group Finder resource for caregivers, family members, and people affected by strokes. Local National Stroke Association support groups tend to meet at the nearest hospital and are facilitated by a professional counselor.\n\nParkinson’s Foundation. Use the Parkinson’s Foundation locator to find local chapters and resources near you. In the results listing, you’ll find services local chapters offer, including support groups.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society’s “Search for Resources” page enables users to find local support groups for particular types of cancer. Enter in your ZIP code or city and state, then select “support” and the specific cancer in the “program” field.\n\nVA Caregiver Support Groups. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) created The National Caregiver Support Line to assist VA caregivers, veterans, and others seeking caregiver information to speak with licensed, caring professionals. They can connect you with a Caregiver Support Coordinator at a VA Medical Center near you, or simply offer a listening ear. You can reach the support line at 1-855-260-3274, Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST.\n\nMental Health America. Find local support for people with mental health conditions and their caregivers at this comprehensive site. Some support groups are peer-led while others may be led by a mental health professional.\n\nBenefits of a caregiver support group\n\nBenefits of joining caregiver support groups include:\n\nForming friendships with other family caregivers, which can reduce feelings of loneliness, isolation, and anxiety\n\nGetting advice from other caregivers regarding practical solutions, treatment options, and what to expect in the future; caregivers share their tips and learn new healthy coping skills\n\nGaining a sense of empowerment and control\n\nOvercoming the guilt of placing a loved one in a senior care community\n\nGiving a better quality of life to your senior loved one\n\nHow can I join a closed (private) Facebook group?\n\nYou can find comfort in knowing that closed Facebook groups are private. All posts and comments can only be seen by other members of the group. Your activity will not show on your personal Facebook page.\n\nFollow these steps if you are looking to join a closed Facebook group:\n\nSign in to your Facebook account. If you don’t already have an account, there are simple steps to sign up for one.\n\nSearch for the Facebook group you’d like to join, and go to that group’s page.\n\nClick the “Join Group” button, which sends a request to the group’s administrators and organizers.\n\nWait to be admitted into the group.

If available, check the special instructions to join or the community guidelines, and assess if this group is the right fit for you.\n\nIf at any time you want to leave a Facebook group after your request has been accepted, there are simple steps you can take to do so.",
      "# [20 Nutritious and Easy Recipes for Senior Nutrition by Claire Samuels on 2024-04-30](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/easy-recipes-for-senior-nutrition)\nKey Takeaways\n\nSeniors often lose interest in cooking. Medication side effects, changing taste buds, physical difficulty, and eating alone are all reasons older adults may not cook.\n\nMany stores offer pre-cut vegetables and canned ingredients, which reduces prep time. Tasty veggie recipes include stir-fry, stuffed sweet potatoes, and garlicky roasted eggplant.\n\nCooking with grandchildren can make it more enjoyable. Pizza dough, homemade ice cream, and vegetable nachos can be fun, easy, and memorable recipes for the grandkids.\n\nMany seniors don't drink enough water. To combat dehydration and improve health, seniors can infuse water with fruits and herbs.\n\nPreparing and planning easy meals for seniors\n\nWe’ve compiled 20 delicious and easy meal ideas for seniors that combine fresh produce with pantry staples for fulfilling dinners, side dishes, and drinks. The best part? Each easy recipe requires minimal prep, has seven or fewer steps, and is on the table in under an hour.\n\nMeal planning can be even easier now, as many grocery stores make cooking more accessible by offering fresh, pre-cut fruits and vegetables. This reduces prep time as well as physical strain for older adults with arthritis or another health condition that makes chopping difficult. But frozen fruits and veggies are also great to keep on hand — you don’t have to worry about upcoming expiration dates, and they can help you pull a nutritious meal together quickly.\n\nAn unhealthy diet can lead to a range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[01] Incorporate some of the following recipes for elderly parents to help you or an aging loved one combat illnesses and maintain a well-balanced diet.\n\nRead more:10 Health Tips for Seniors\n\nVeggies shine in these easy recipes for seniors\n\nA rainbow of fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables add vitamins and minerals to your diet. If you have a farmers market near you, stock up on locally grown favorites. If you don’t, your grocery store should offer delicious produce all year. Adults should aim to eat at least 14 ounces (or 1 1/2 cups) of fruits and veggies each day, according to WHO.\n\n1. One-pan salmon and vegetables\n\nThis recipe is so easy, it’s almost not even a recipe. It showcases flaky and rich pink salmon, a low-calorie protein source full of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and energy-boosting B vitamins.[02]\n\nThis non-recipe is versatile! Replace salmon with another flaky fish like tilapia or trout. Swap out the veggies for whatever’s in your fridge, or add potatoes for a heartier meal.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 squash or zucchini, sliced into rounds\n\n½ onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes\n\n1 bell pepper, sliced\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\n1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning or your favorite fish-seasoning blend\n\n2-3 salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each\n\n1 lemon, optional\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 450 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil (not wax paper).

Brush with remaining olive oil and top with 2 thin lemon slices each.\n\nRoast for 12-15 minutes until salmon is flaky and mostly opaque.\n\nAdd 1 salmon fillet and a heaping serving of roasted veggies to each plate for a healthy and satisfying meal. Enjoy!\n\n2. Tasty tomato tart\n\nThis easy weeknight dinner is packed with lycopene and vitamin C to boost vision health and add to senior nutrition.[02] It’s similar enough to pizza that even picky eaters will try it — but it’s a total showstopper with fresh, colorful ingredients.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed\n\n1 onion, thinly sliced\n\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n2-3 large tomatoes (multiple colors make a beautiful tart, but red works just as well)\n\n1 cup of your favorite cheese (such as blue cheese, mozzarella, feta, or Parmesan)\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or chopped fresh herbs like basil and oregano\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nStretch out the puff pastry on the lined baking sheet. With a fork, poke small holes along the bottom.\n\nAdd onions and olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft — about 5 minutes.\n\nSprinkle cooked onions over the pastry dough, then top with tomato slices so they don’t overlap. Sprinkle with cheese and half of your seasoning or herbs. Season with salt (or salt replacement, if you’re avoiding sodium) and pepper to your tastes.\n\nBake for 25 minutes until the crust is golden. Sprinkle with the remaining herbs, cut into squares, and enjoy!\n\n3. Roasted root vegetables\n\nRoot vegetables — like sweet potatoes, beets, parsnips, and carrots — are vibrant and versatile. They’re high in fiber and antioxidants, and some have been proven to stabilize blood sugar as a successful part of a diabetic diet.[02] They’re also a tasty replacement for classic roasted potatoes — and just as easy to make.\n\nThis recipe involves chopping firm vegetables, which may be difficult for some seniors. To get the benefits of root vegetables without as much knife work, check out the recipe for Stuffed Southwest Sweet Potatoes below.\n\nIngredients\n\n½ red onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 large sweet potato, peeled\n\n2 large carrots, peeled\n\n1 large beet, scrubbed and trimmed\n\nSeveral new potatoes, skin on, cut in halves or quarters\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n4 teaspoons mixed dried herbs, like rosemary, oregano, and parsley\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 F and grease a large baking sheet.\n\nCut root vegetables into even-sized pieces, about an inch each.\n\nToss root vegetables with olive oil, herbs, salt, and pepper. Spread in an evenly spaced layer on the prepared pan.\n\nBake for 30-40 minutes, stirring and flipping vegetables twice or until soft.\n\n4. Berry chicken salad\n\nFor a colorful and protein-packed lunch, this easy recipe for seniors repurposes leftover shredded or chopped chicken into a salad that replaces classic grapes with fresh, antioxidant-rich berries.\n\nIngredients\n\n¼ cup olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\n½ teaspoon dried tarragon\n\n1½ cups chopped or shredded leftover chicken (about 1 breast)\n\n1 cup quartered fresh strawberries or whole fresh blueberries\n\n½ cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed\n\n¼ cup chopped celery\n\nTorn salad greens or spinach\n\nInstructions\n\nWhisk the first three ingredients together in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdd chicken, berries, peas, and celery, and stir well to combine.\n\nScoop chicken salad over salad greens or spinach for a fresh and filling lunch.\n\nRecipe adapted from Taste of Home\n\n5. Vegetable stir-fry\n\nThis quick take on everyone’s favorite carryout dish can be adapted to whatever ingredients you have on hand and made in one pan for easy cleanup.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil or non-hydrogenated vegetable oil\n\n½ pound protein, such as cubed chicken breast, sliced steak, or tofu\n\n2 cups mixed vegetables (such as peppers, zucchini, broccoli, onions, snap peas, and mushrooms)\n\nFor the sauce\n\n¼ cup orange juice\n\n¼ cup water\n\n2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1 teaspoon fresh ginger or a sprinkling of ginger powder\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook the protein, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and cooked through. Add vegetables and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until soft. Remove meat and veggies from the pan and set aside.\n\nMix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Add the mixture to your pan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.\n\nAdd vegetables and protein back to the pan and stir to combine.\n\nServe over brown rice or noodles for a filling meal.\n\n6. Garlicky roasted eggplant with creamy yogurt sauce\n\nEggplant is the star of this easy meal idea for seniors and is a great source of senior nutrition that boasts phytonutrients — a memory booster — and fiber for digestive health.[02] It’s also a soft food that’s easy on dentures without being mushy.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch slices\n\n2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (use pre-chopped from the jar if easier)\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon Mediterranean spice blend or your favorite blend\n\nInstructions\n\nPlace eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a couple minutes while your oven preheats to 400 F (this softens them and reduces bitterness).\n\nMix garlic, olive oil, and spice blend in a small bowl.\n\nBrush both sides of eggplant with the olive oil mixture for a dose of heart-healthy fats.\n\nRoast eggplant for about 30 minutes, until caramelized, flipping once about halfway through.\n\nFor the Creamy Yogurt Sauce\n\n1 cup Greek yogurt (a great source of probiotics for digestive health)\n\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n1 tablespoon fresh herbs, like basil or mint (optional)\n\nMix all ingredients in a small bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve your roasted eggplant with the yogurt sauce for a fresh, Mediterranean dish. Consider brown rice, whole-grain pasta, or chopped cucumbers and tomatoes as a side dish.\n\n7. “Anything goes” quiche\n\nQuiche has been a popular brunch food for decades and was seen as a luxury for many seniors growing up. This is a fairly inexpensive, easy meal idea for elderly adults that includes leafy greens rich in magnesium, iron, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and K.[02] Make this tasty treat for breakfast and enjoy leftovers throughout the week.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 refrigerated pie crust\n\n5 eggs\n\n1 cup half-and-half\n\n½ teaspoon seasoning of your choice, such as mustard, dill, or rosemary\n\n¾ cup crispy bacon, crumbled cooked sausage, or leftover ham, chopped\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or Swiss cheese\n\n1 cup spinach or kale, torn or chopped\n\n½ cup of your favorite veggie, diced (tomato, broccoli, asparagus, and peppers are good options)\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and roll pie crust into your pie plate.\n\nWhisk eggs, half-and-half, and seasoning in a medium bowl.\n\nSprinkle meat, cheese, and veggies onto the prepared pie crust evenly.

Let cool 10 minutes before slicing and enjoying.\n\nRecipe adapted from Pillsbury, with vegetables added\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nEasy pantry staple meal ideas for elderly adults\n\nAll of these easy-to-cook recipes for seniors are a nutritious rewrite of a traditional classic. Plus, they all use at least three pantry or freezer staples to minimize shopping and stay budget-friendly. While carbohydrates are often talked about in a negative light, they’re actually part of a healthy diet and help aging adults find energy to fuel their daily activities, according to WHO.[01]\n\n8. Healthy-ish tuna veggie casserole\n\nThis no-fuss take on the classic is perfect for a rainy afternoon when you’re in the mood for something hearty but nutritious. The pasta provides whole grains, while the tuna offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which are both great for senior nutrition.[02] Broccoli and peas are also rich sources of nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nNote: If arthritis makes opening cans difficult, invest in an electric can opener — it’s a great kitchen tool!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (12-ounce) bag whole-wheat egg noodles\n\n2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, drained\n\n2 (10 ¾-ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup\n\n2 cups frozen veggies, like peas, broccoli, carrots, or a combination\n\n½ cup milk\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n8 buttery crackers, like Ritz\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease a 3-quart casserole dish or 13-by-9-inch pan.\n\nCook whole-wheat noodles according to package directions; drain thoroughly.\n\nMix the warm cooked noodles with tuna, soup, veggies, milk, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper as desired (you can add some red pepper flakes for a kick). Spoon into your prepared pan.\n\nCrush up your crackers into small chunks and spread over the top. Feel free to add some more shredded cheese!\n\nBake for 20 minutes until golden, bubbly, and beginning to brown. Serve warm.\n\nRecipe adapted from The Spruce Eats\n\n9. Southwest stuffed sweet potatoes\n\nSweet potatoes are a powerhouse of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals — and they keep as pantry staples for nearly a month.[02] They also may improve your immune system with high levels of vitamin A.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large sweet potatoes, washed and dried\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 (12 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained*\n\n1 (10 ounce) can diced tomato pepper mix, drained\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack\n\n*For a soft food substitute, use refried black beans.\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nCut potatoes in half lengthwise, then brush with olive oil and salt.\n\nBake potatoes (cut side down) for 30 minutes or until cooked through.\n\nRemove from oven, allow to cool slightly, and mash up potato flesh with a fork.\n\nSprinkle potatoes with beans, tomato pepper mix, and cheese so the toppings are evenly divided.\n\nReturn to the oven for 5 minutes until cheese is melted.\n\n10. Chickpea tuna salad\n\nHigh-protein chickpeas are a good source of magnesium and potassium, which may reduce blood pressure.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n\n1 (5-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked\n\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 cup halved cherry tomatoes\n\n½ cup green or black olives, or 2 tablespoons capers (optional)\n\nSpinach or torn salad greens\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd the chickpeas, tuna, mustard, mayonnaise, and cherry tomatoes to a bowl and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Add olives or capers, if using.\n\nLay a bed of spinach or greens on a plate and top with salad mixture for an easy dinner. Alternatively, eat the salad between two slices of whole-grain bread like a tuna salad sandwich.\n\n11. Simple soup\n\nThis is a go-to healthy recipe for seniors because it’s open to substitutions and relies on nutrient-dense pantry staples. It’s also a soft food that works for seniors who have trouble chewing or other dental problems.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pound ground beef, Italian sausage, or turkey\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n1 (32-ounce) box low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 (15 ounce) can cannellini or white beans\n\n1 (10 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup frozen or canned spinach or collard greens (use fresh if you’ve got them on hand)\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd meat to a large soup pot over medium heat. Break apart and stir until browned. Add onion and continue to cook, about 5 minutes, until soft.\n\nIf a fair amount of fat has collected at the bottom of your pan, pour the meat mixture onto paper towels to drain. This may not be necessary for ground turkey or lean beef.\n\nReturn meat and onions to the pot and add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes until the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe alongside crusty whole-grain bread for a filling meal, or, for a heartier meal, add cooked pasta before serving.\n\nTip: If you’re cooking for someone who prefers softer food, a good trick for soups or stews is to blend half and add it back into the pot for a smoother texture. If blending part of the soup, use caution. The liquid will be hot, and, if not handled with care, blenders can splatter the liquid, creating a burn risk. Make sure to keep a hand on the blender lid while blending to reduce the risk of it coming off.\n\n12. Four bean salad\n\nThis easy recipe is a classic for a reason! The dressing is tangy and sweet, and beans provide proteins and B vitamins.[02] We switched out traditional vegetable oil in favor of olive oil for a more heart-healthy fat.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can wax beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can green beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n1 white or yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\n⅔ cup white or apple cider vinegar\n\n½ cup white sugar or ¼ cup honey\n\n⅓ cup olive oil\n\nInstructions\n\nMix all ingredients together in a large bowl or Tupperware container. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nRefrigerate overnight, or at least for several hours, to marinate. Enjoy as a side for grilled chicken or as a topping for green salad.\n\n13. Italian stuffed peppers\n\nBell peppers are a low-calorie, high-flavor vegetable containing folate, fiber, and iron, making them a great source for senior nutrition.[02] They’re also a good base for a variety of fillings and sauces. This versatile, easy recipe could even be made as Mexican stuffed peppers with salsa and taco seasoning.\n\nIngredients\n\n4-6 bell peppers (red, green, yellow, and orange all work)\n\n1 pound ground Italian sausage or ground beef\n\n1 cup cooked quinoa, wild rice, or whole grain of your choice\n\n1 (15-ounce) jar or can tomato sauce\n\n1 cup frozen spinach\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n\n½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease an 8-inch glass baking dish or casserole.\n\nCut the tops from peppers, scoop out seeds, and rinse.\n\nIn a medium skillet, cook beef or sausage about 10 minutes, or until browned. Remove from heat and drain the meat, then return to pan.\n\nStir grains, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, spinach, and seasonings into the cooked meat.\n\nNestle peppers, standing up, into the baking dish. Stuff them with the meat, grain, and spinach mixture until full.\n\nPour remaining tomato sauce over the peppers and top with shredded mozzarella. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.\n\nBake 20 minutes covered. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and bake about 10 minutes longer until cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n14. Creamy pasta and peas\n\nBright green peas — a low-fat legume naturally high in protein and fiber — and fresh lemon are flavorful ingredients that give easy recipes a pop of color and flavor. This dish also offers plenty of onion (full of antioxidants) and olive oil, a heart-healthy, vegetable-based fat.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 zucchini or summer squash, cut into thin rounds\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus some for serving\n\n½ pound short pasta, like shells or penne\n\n1 pound bag frozen peas\n\n½ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nLemon juice to taste\n\nFresh basil, if desired\n\nInstructions\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil on the stove.\n\nWhile the water heats up, sauté zucchini or squash, onion, and olive oil over medium heat in a separate pan.\n\nCook pasta according to package directions, adding your frozen peas to the boiling water with 5 minutes remaining.\n\nRemove 1 cup of starchy pasta water from the pot and set aside. Drain pasta and peas and return to the pot, along with onion, olive oil, and veggies.\n\nWhile the mixture is hot, add Parmesan and stir. Slowly, begin to add the starchy water to the mixture. This is where the magic happens! The Parmesan and pasta water will emulsify to make a creamy, restaurant-style sauce — no heavy cream involved.\n\nSprinkle with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and a light drizzle of olive oil to serve. Add basil, if desired.\n\nFamily recipes for senior fun with grandchildren\n\nCooking is a fun way to bond with grandchildren while passing along important life skills. These recipes are not only simple, creative, and tasty, but they’re easy recipes for seniors and families.\n\n15. Easy-peasy pizza dough\n\nWith few ingredients and no rise time, this family recipe is simple. Encourage grandkids to roll the dough into silly shapes, make breadsticks that look like their initials, and enjoy playing — it’s great for little hands. You can be creative with toppings, too!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (2 ¼ teaspoon) packet yeast\n\n1 cup warm water\n\n1 tablespoon sugar or honey\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (you can replace half with whole wheat)\n\nYour favorite sauce, toppings, and cheese\n\nInstructions\n\nSprinkle yeast over warm water and honey in a large bowl. Wait about 10 minutes until the yeast is bubbly and frothy.\n\nAdd olive oil and salt and stir.

      "# [Medicare, Medicaid, and Long-Term Care by Kayla Van Erdewyk on 2023-12-20](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/medicaid-long-term-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nMedicaid and Medicare cover some senior living costs. However, seniors who require medical care are likely to benefit the most.\n\nNot every senior living community accepts Medicaid. If your prospective community does accept it, contact your state Medicaid office to apply.\n\nTake advantage of Medicare’s components. Depending on the type of care, Medicare may cover medical costs, such as skilled nursing and prescriptions.\n\nUse your local resources. Make the most of public benefits by contacting local offices for support.\n\nAs many as 6 million eligible Americans either don’t apply for or don’t use their benefits each year, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Many factors contribute to this staggering number, notes Letha Sgritta McDowell, an elder law attorney who practices at Hook Law Center in Virginia and North Carolina.\n\n“It’s really about comprehending the rules,” explains McDowell, who also serves as president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA). “Many people don’t understand the intricacies of how public benefits work.”\n\nWhat is Medicaid?\n\nMedicaid is a state and federal program designed to provide health care coverage to vulnerable populations, or to people who might not otherwise have health insurance. It’s currently the largest source of health insurance in the U.S., providing coverage for people with low income or significant medical expenses.[01] For certain populations, Medicaid also covers long-term care provided in a nursing home or via home and community based services.\n\nSince Medicaid is administered by individual states, the program’s coverage provided — as well as eligibility requirements — vary significantly based on where you live. Due to this complexity, it’s often best for seniors and their families to work with an elder law attorney, specifically one who focuses on Medicaid planning.\n\nWho’s eligible for Medicaid?\n\nTo qualify for Medicaid long-term care, an applicant must meet financial requirements (income and asset limits) and functional requirements (such as needing a nursing home level of care). Specific eligibility requirements for long-term care coverage vary by state and by program.[02]\n\nIf your family member is planning to apply for Medicaid, it’s a good idea to contact your state medical assistance office for more details. Depending on where you live, Medicaid programs may go by different names.\n\nHow to become eligible for Medicaid through Medicaid “spenddown”\n\nIn many cases, older adults may have income above the Medicaid threshold yet still find themselves in need of public assistance due to high medical costs. Several states address this through a Medicaid “spenddown,” which allows seniors to reduce their countable income by subtracting allowable medical expenses. By lowering their countable income, these individuals may become eligible for Medicaid. This may also be referred to as the medically needy pathway to Medicaid eligibility.\n\nFor example, a single senior might receive $2,000 each month in income but live in a state that requires Medicaid recipients to have monthly income below $1,215. If their state has a Medicaid spenddown program, they could qualify for Medicaid by spending $785 each month on medical expenses, including prescription drugs, doctor copays, and long-term care costs. Spend down periods vary by state and may be anywhere from one month to six months in length. After a senior spends down to their state’s medically needy income limit, they’re eligible for Medicaid for the rest of the period (as long as they meet all other criteria). It’s important to track and document all medical expenses if you’re considering a Medicaid spenddown.\n\nWhat is Medicare?\n\nMedicare provides federal health insurance coverage to almost all Americans ages 65 and older and to younger people with certain disabilities or medical conditions. It has several separate components: [03]\n\nPart A, hospital insurance, which helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility, as well as some home health care and hospice care services.\n\nPart B, medical insurance, which helps pay for doctors’ services and many other medical services and supplies.\n\nPart C, or Medicare Advantage Plans, are sold by private health insurance companies. Medicare Advantage Plans include all of the same benefits as Medicare Parts A and B, but these plans are administered by Medicare-approved private insurance companies rather than by Medicare directly.\n\nPart D, or prescription drug coverage, which helps pay for medications prescribed by seniors’ physicians or other specialists.\n\nWhile most people don’t pay a premium for Part A, Medicare’s other forms of coverage come with monthly costs for seniors.\n\nWho’s eligible for Medicare?\n\nMedicare recipients must meet one of the following requirements:[04]\n\nBe age 65 or older\n\nHave a disability determined by the Social Security Administration\n\nHave amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or end-stage renal disease\n\nMedicare open enrollment occurs annually between October 15 and December 7. This is when eligible seniors can make changes to their Medicare benefits.[05]\n\nIf seniors apply for Social Security retirement or disability benefits before they turn 65, they may be automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Eligible adults who wait until they’re 65 or older to receive retirement benefits or enroll in Medicare must actively sign up for Medicare coverge.[06] Seniors who choose to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans will have to select a plan, complete paperwork, and pay monthly premiums. The Social Security website is a resource that can help seniors review requirements and start the Medicare application process.\n\nPublic payment options for independent living\n\nAccording to A Place for Mom’s 2023 proprietary data, the national median cost of independent living is $3,000 per month.[07] While independent living is typically one of the least expensive senior living options, public pay options do not cover these costs.\n\nDoes Medicare pay for independent living?\n\nSince Medicare covers only health care services, it doesn’t pay for independent living. Seniors in independent living are usually healthy and active. They choose this senior living option for benefits like housekeeping, lawn maintenance, and social activities.\n\nDoes Medicaid pay for independent living?\n\nBecause independent living doesn’t include medical services or personal care services, Medicaid doesn’t cover this senior living setting.\n\nPublic payment options for assisted living\n\nAccording to A Place for Mom’s 2023 proprietary data, the national median cost of assisted living is $4,807 per month.[07] Assisted living provides care to seniors who are largely independent but could benefit from assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs), which is also referred to as custodial care. While Medicare doesn’t cover this type of care, Medicaid has more to offer.\n\nDoes Medicare pay for assisted living?\n\nNo, Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care or custodial care, so it doesn’t pay for assisted living. However, Medicare will continue to cover a senior’s approved medical care.\n\nDoes Medicaid pay for assisted living?\n\nSome — but not all — states have Medicaid state programs or Medicaid waiver programs that help cover the costs of home and community based services like assisted living. Medicaid is not accepted in every assisted living community, and it usually won’t cover the total price of room and board. However, medical expenses that occur in assisted living may be covered by Medicaid.\n\nIn some states, Medicaid can be used to pay for the following:\n\nHelp with ADLs, like toileting, mobility, and dressing\n\nHome health services, which may be provided in an assisted living community\n\nPhysical, occupational, or speech therapy\n\nMedication management\n\nRead more:Assisted Living Medicaid Waivers: A State-by-State Guide\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nPublic payment options for memory care\n\nAccording to A Place for Mom’s 2023 proprietary data, the national median cost for memory care is $5,995 per month.[07] This type of senior living caters to seniors who experience memory challenges due to Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Both Medicare and Medicaid cover some services outside of room and board.\n\nDoes Medicare pay for memory care?\n\nMedicare won’t pay for rent, board, or personal care in memory care facilities. However, Medicare does cover many health care costs associated with dementia, such as cognitive testing, medical appointments, and necessary medications.\n\nDoes Medicaid pay for memory care?\n\nThe cost of memory care room and board is not covered by Medicaid. However, as long as the memory care facility accepts Medicaid and is licensed as a Medicaid-approved memory care community, waivers may cover some services. Waivers and coverage amounts vary depending on where a senior receives memory care.\n\nSeniors who receive dementia care services in an assisted living community can apply for coverage of home and community based services (HCBS). HCBS programs may be used to cover some of the assisted living care costs, reducing senior living expenses.\n\nSeniors who receive dementia care services in a nursing home can receive full Medicaid coverage. As long as a senior needs both dementia care and skilled nursing care, Medicaid will cover services, room, and board.\n\nPublic payment options for nursing homes\n\nThe national median cost for nursing homes varies by room type. Families can expect to pay $7,908 per month for a semi-private room or $9,034 for a private room.[08] This type of long-term care is only covered by Medicaid.\n\nDoes Medicare pay for nursing homes?\n\n“The number one misconception about Medicare is that it will pay for your long-term care,” says McDowell. Medicare will only pay for short-term stays in nursing care facilities, like a rehabilitative stay after hospitalization or an end-of-life hospice stay.\n\nSeniors who need care in a skilled nursing facility due to an injury or period of acute illness can receive Medicare coverage for up to 100 days, but only after incurring a qualifying three-night hospital stay. In addition, the patient must require skilled care to prevent a decline in their condition.\n\nA covered stay in a skilled nursing facility comes with the following costs: [09]\n\nOlder adults pay nothing for the first 20 days, with Medicare covering the entire bill.\n\nMedicare pays for nearly all costs for days 21-100. However, seniors are responsible for approximately $200 per day in coinsurance. Skilled nursing facility coinsurance is at least partially covered by most Medicare supplement (Medigap) plans.\n\nAfter 100 days, Medicare will not pay for any skilled nursing facility costs.\n\nMedicare also covers hospice and palliative care in a senior’s home, including long-term care settings.[10]\n\nDoes Medicaid pay for nursing homes?\n\nMedicaid pays for long-term care in a nursing home if a senior meets the program’s eligibility criteria. Once approved, seniors must pay a monthly coinsurance amount based on their income. If a senior’s prospective nursing home accepts Medicaid, the program will then cover nearly all associated costs including a senior’s room, board, and health care services.\n\nPublic payment options for home care and home health care\n\nAccording to A Place for Mom’s 2023 proprietary data, the national median cost for nonmedical home care is $30 per hour.[07] This type of senior care mainly provides companionship and assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs). Home health care is a type of medical care provided in a senior’s home, which can include specialized therapies and skilled nursing care.\n\nAs long as a home care service is medically necessary, Medicare and Medicaid may provide some coverage.\n\nDoes Medicare pay for home care?\n\nMedicare doesn’t pay for long-term home care. Medicare only covers medically necessary part-time or intermittent home health care services for homebound seniors. Generally, this amounts to up to eight hours of care per day, with a maximum of 28 hours per week. A senior may be able to qualify for more frequent care for a short time if their doctor or other health care provider determines it’s necessary.[11]\n\nMedicare primarily pays for treatments that help seniors recuperate from an injury or illness, such as: [11]\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nOccupational therapy\n\nSpeech-language pathology services\n\nPart-time skilled nursing care\n\nIf they’re able, some families hire an in-home caregiver to give their loved one companionship or to reduce their household responsibilities, like chores and meal preparation.\n\nMedicare doesn’t pay for these aspects of home care: [11]\n\n24-hour care\n\nMeal preparation or delivery\n\nHousehold tasks like personal shopping, cleaning, and laundry\n\nPersonal care services like assistance with bathing and toileting, if that’s the only care a senior needs\n\nDoes Medicaid pay for home care?\n\nMedicaid pays for home health care for qualifying seniors in all states. If a senior requires medically necessary home health care and meets the financial criteria, Medicaid will cover the costs of the following items and services: [12]\n\nSkilled nursing care\n\nHome health aide support\n\nMedical supplies\n\nYou can also check for Medicaid home and community based services programs to help pay for the following nonmedical home care services: [13]\n\nAssistance with ADLs\n\nHelp with cooking, cleaning, and laundry\n\nTransportation\n\nAssistance with medical devices\n\nRead more:Home Care vs. Home Health Care: What's the Difference?\n\nHow to choose a senior living facility that accepts Medicaid\n\nWhether your family member currently has Medicaid coverage or thinks they may be eligible someday, public payment sources can significantly alter the senior living options that are available to them. Many communities don’t accept Medicaid, so it’s crucial to plan ahead and verify this information upfront.\n\nConsider the following tips when searching for senior living:\n\nContact your state Medicaid office. Representatives can typically connect families with long-term care communities that accept Medicaid benefits, as well as offer other resources and information.\n\nAsk questions specifically related to public pay. Verify whether prospective communities accept Medicaid, find out how many beds or units are reserved for residents who receive Medicaid, and determine if there’s a waiting list. Plus, if it applies to your loved one, ask what happens if they aren’t eligible for Medicaid at move in but become eligible at a later date.\n\nSchedule a virtual or in-person tour. Tours can help you gain insight into community life and allow you to compare different facility options.\n\nDownload A Place for Mom’s community touring checklist. This free resource suggests questions to ask and includes a convenient space for caregivers to take notes. It can help you compare communities based on your budget, care needs, observations, and preferences.\n\nGet input from all decision makers. If your loved one is well enough to weigh in on their own care, ask for their opinion and perspective. Invite them to tour several communities, meet the staff, and ask questions. Similarly, if siblings or other relatives are involved, make sure everyone is on the same page about long-term care decisions.\n\nGather necessary documents and paperwork. Most communities will request a wide range of medical documents to ensure they can properly care for your parent. These typically include proof of diagnoses, medication lists, and doctors’ notes. If your loved one is in the hospital, ask their case manager to fax these documents to communities you’re considering. Otherwise, schedule a doctor’s appointment for your relative to complete this process.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nMoving into a senior living community\n\nAfter you’ve chosen the right community and determined availability, it’s time for your loved one to move in. The following tips can help make this process as smooth as possible:\n\nIdentify what moving day will look like. How many people will be involved in the moving day process? What items will you bring right away, and how will they fit into the new space? Are you planning on hiring a senior move manager? Considering these questions in advance can help you make a clear plan.\n\nBring essential admissions documents and paperwork. These documents include your loved one’s Medicare card, all secondary insurance cards, medical paperwork, and a list of emergency contacts. Additionally, bring any legal paperwork, including power of attorney documents, a living will, and any Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders.\n\nParticipate in discussions about your loved one’s care plan and next steps. Even though your relative is moving, you can still be involved. Ask about when care plan meetings will be and what to expect from staff communication.\n\nAdditional resources for navigating Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care\n\nDetermining how Medicaid and Medicare help cover senior living can be a challenge for most seniors and their families. One-size-fits-all advice may not apply to each family’s unique situation, especially low-income seniors.\n\n“Doing your own research and then talking to an expert is so critical,” urges McDowell. “In the same way a financial advisor or accountant would talk to someone about how to reduce their taxes, that’s how an elder law attorney would help someone decide the best option for their long-term care.”\n\nBrowse the resources below for further assistance with long-term care and benefits planning:\n\nSeniors and their families can use the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA) database to find a qualified, local elder law attorney. Consider seeking an attorney who specializes in Medicare and Medicaid policies.\n\nSenior veterans may be eligible for other cost assistance, such as Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.\n\nGet answers to your Medicare questions by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), or by contacting the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) office in your region.\n\nExperts in your state or territory can help answer questions about specific Medicaid policies.

      "# [Assisted Living Activities and Calendar by Haines Eason on 2024-01-29](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-activities)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe best assisted living communities have a lot of activity options to choose from. Residents’ individual abilities and interests vary, and it’s important to offer plenty of ways to explore.\n\nActivities keep seniors engaged mentally and physically. This can help improve general health, extend longevity, stave off depression, and increase cognitive abilities.\n\nDon’t focus on just bingo, checkers, or dominoes. Offerings can include swing dancing, pottery, academic lectures, and more.\n\nActivities don’t have to occur on-site. Many communities plan field trips to local or even semi-distant attractions.\n\nThe benefits of assisted living activities for seniors\n\nAssisted living communities offer a variety of activities to suit residents’ varying abilities and interests. Luxury assisted living communities may offer more activities than more budget conscious options. And, though the primary goal of diverse activities is to keep residents happy, there are major health benefits that come from an active lifestyle.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), seniors who make an effort to engage themselves mentally and physically may be able to do the following:[01]\n\nFend off certain diseases. The list is long and includes dementia, diabetes, heart disease, and more. Plus, having a schedule can enhance purpose and happiness, two factors that can lead to a longer life.\n\nPreserve physical ability. Exercise has been shown to decrease depression, falls, and blood pressure while improving strength, balance, and sleep. Physical activity also stimulates blood flow to the brain, which may help improve cognitive function.\n\nIncrease mental stimulation. Keeping your mind sharp through activities can reduce signs of memory loss and cognitive decline. For this reason, many assisted living communities provide mentally stimulating activities, or “brain games,” to exercise residents’ minds and practice mindfulness. It’s hard to choose wrong, though. Cards, dancing, gardening — so many activities are so good at strengthening the mind.\n\nStave off depression and increase resilience. Studies show that social connection and exercise help keep the blues at bay. When we’re better able to do that, we increase our general resilience.\n\nReduced isolation. Researchers are learning more about the dangers of social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Too much time alone increases a senior’s risk of dementia, as well as other health problems including high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and heart disease.\n\nActivities for seniors in assisted living that suit all interests and lifestyles\n\nWhat follows are some of the top ways assisted living communities help seniors stay active. Because senior living communities are always looking for new ways to delight and engage their residents, this list is not exhaustive, so be sure to ask any prospective community for their list of activity offerings.\n\nLearning new skills\n\nOngoing learning is crucial to feeling energized and interested in life. And, learning is a brain workout that can stave off memory loss and worse.\n\nWorkshops and classes in senior living communities often include the following:\n\nArts and crafts, such as painting, knitting, pottery, and woodworking classes\n\nScholarly presentations, including informational, academic, and educational lectures\n\nWritten and spoken word events, like book clubs, book or poetry readings, and writing workshops\n\nTechnical skills, as in computer and foreign language classes tailored to specific skills or the general learner\n\nReligious studies, prayer groups, and worship circles may be offered in religious assisted living settings, like Catholic communities or other faith-based communities.\n\nNote: A quality senior community will poll its residents to ensure offerings match residents’ tastes.\n\nDancing\n\nDancing remains ever-popular at senior communities and can even be a daily event at many. Dancing is not only fun, but it also helps keep residents’ bodies and minds fit.[02] Plus, it’s an excellent social opportunity. Residents often enjoy a variety of dancing styles:\n\nBallroom dancing, an ever-popular classic\n\nLine and square dancing, also very popular, and not just in the South or Midwest\n\nSwing dancing, a very good workout\n\nEntertainment\n\nThe show must go on! Entertainment is a mainstay of most assisted living facilities. Entertainers often perform at communities so residents don’t need to travel, and sometimes friends and family are even invited. Types of senior living entertainment can vary:\n\nStand-up comedy. Comics are known to visit communities, but residents may have a shot at the mic, too.\n\nVisiting trivia hosts. Topics are often focused on decades of relevance to the resident seniors.\n\nPedigree dog shows. Pets’ benefit to seniors is outsized.\n\nVisiting dramatic troupes. As with comics, residents may also have the opportunity to perform skits, scenes, or even whole works.\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nAssisted living exercise and mindfulness activities\n\nToday’s senior communities strive to make fitness fun and easily accessible through on-site, ability- and skill-relevant gyms, plus a variety of activities. More and more communities are also offering mindfulness-supporting activities.\n\nFun fitness opportunities:\n\nDancing classes or events\n\nTraditional aerobics classes\n\nSwimming\n\nWater weight training or aerobics\n\nZumba and spin class\n\nMindfulness activities:\n\nFlower arranging\n\nGardening\n\nMeditation\n\nTai chi\n\nYoga or chair yoga\n\nRead rmore:Mindfulness for Seniors: A Guide for Caregivers and Their Elderly Loved Ones\n\nMusic and karaoke\n\nSinging is great for the soul, and there’s no such thing as bad singing if it comes from the heart. Many assisted living communities stage their own competitions like “American Idol” or “The Masked Singer,” but even old-fashioned karaoke is a blast. Residents may even be serenaded by community choirs or other talented musicians. These activities benefit the mind, as well: music therapy is fast becoming very popular in memory care communities.\n\nWhatever the kind of music, residents are sure to find something they’ll enjoy:\n\nSinging contests. A little friendly competition listening to beloved tunes can be great for the mind and soul.\n\nKaraoke. Now it’s easier than ever to host a sing-along with a mobile phone app.\n\nShows from private musicians. Musicians want to share their talents, and many jump at the chance to perform for seniors.\n\nChildren’s choir visits. Local churches are often eager to have their choir visit a senior community.\n\nSpecial events\n\nMany special events are holiday-themed, but no special occasion is needed to have fun. Some communities hold carnivals for residents complete with cotton candy and dunk tanks, while others host senior proms or screenings of major events such as political debates and sports championships. Of course, personal celebrations — birthdays, anniversaries — are always highlighted.\n\nEach community hosts different kinds of special events, so be sure to explore ones that interest you or your elderly loved one. Here are a few types of special events you’ll likely find in assisted living:\n\nClassic car shows\n\nArt shows\n\nFashion shows\n\nPool parties\n\nHappy hours\n\nGames\n\nBingo is a classic, but it’s not at all the standard anymore. The majority of communities now offer a menu of traditional live and virtual games as activities for seniors in assisted living communities.\n\nNintendo’s Wii, a video game system in which users interact with the game by moving their body rather than manipulating a joystick, is one popular option. Most residents find the Wii easy to learn and downright enjoyable. Popular Wii sports video games include:\n\nBaseball\n\nBowling\n\nTennis\n\nGolf\n\nHowever, no one is tossing traditional games just yet, especially as most have noted brain-boosting benefits. These can include:\n\nTrivia, including board games like Trivial Pursuit\n\nPuzzle games like sudoku and crossword puzzles\n\nStrategy games such as chess and checkers\n\nCard favorites like bridge, canasta, go fish, rummy, and many more\n\nField trips\n\nWho doesn’t love going to new places, spending time with friends, or simply trying something new? Many assisted living communities plan field trips to help residents bond and learn. Here are some common ones:\n\nConcerts are perfect, and many towns put on free shows (like a summertime park concert series) featuring music that’s popular with a broad set of generations.\n\nLocal museums often have rotating displays and sometimes put forward a new take on familiar historical events.\n\nSporting events at high schools, colleges, universities, and farm leagues are usually less boisterous than the pros.\n\nPlays and musicals keep community theaters packed throughout the year, and it’s hard to find a more inspiring art form than live dramatic performance.\n\nMovies remain a classic American pastime, even if your town’s old cinema isn’t quite as packed these days. Civic organizations may host free movie nights in the park, as well.\n\nOutdoor excursions\n\nPeople of all ages need opportunities to experience, not just see, nature. Sensory rooms, screenings of nature shows and movies, flower arranging, and more: These all have benefits. But engaging all the senses in a true natural setting is essential to holistic well-being.[03]\n\nMany assisted living communities help residents immerse themselves in nature by scheduling events like:\n\nPicnics at local parks or even on the community grounds, where friends sit under trees and listen to the wind in the leaves\n\nNature trail walks and garden tours to pick wildflowers and watch the birds flit through the air\n\nCommunity service projects, including litter cleanup and flower or shrub plantings\n\nTrips to farmers markets to taste local treats and help staff plan a menu\n\nAssisted living questions?

Location, services, level of care, on-site amenities, and other elements play a role in assisted living pricing.\n\nAssisted living costs are predicted to rise over time. It’s important to account for inflation and the increasing costs of assisted living as you plan for the future.\n\nThe cheapest assisted living options are in Midwestern, Mountain, and Southern states. Assisted living in the Northeast is more expensive.\n\nThere are multiple payment structures for assisted living. Communities may offer tiered, all-inclusive, or a la carte pricing.\n\nLook at the median cost of assisted living instead of the average\n\nInstead of searching for the average cost of assisted living, it’s actually more helpful to understand the median cost. The median — the cost landing right in the middle between the highest and lowest — shows a more realistic picture of what someone can expect to spend. Assisted living average costs can be easily skewed by extremely high or low numbers. This is especially true in states that have many luxury assisted living communities, such as New York, as the average in those cases may not truly represent the middle.\n\nAssisted living prices have risen an average of 3.51% a year since 2013 and now the median cost of assisted living in 2024 is $4,995 per month. Below is the yearly median cost for assisted living and its percent increase, according to A Place for Mom’s 2024 proprietary data.[01]\n\nA Place for Mom compiled data on assisted living costs based upon information from our partner facilities. This data set shows the national median cost of assisted living communities in 2024:[02]\n\n$164 a day\n\n$4,995 a month\n\n$59,940 a year\n\nIn some high cost of living areas, assisted living costs are closer to $8,000 a month, while states with a lower cost of living offer assisted living prices closer to $3,300 a month.[02] The prices of luxury assisted living communities and budget assisted living communities can vary greatly because of the services provided at each. Additionally, assisted living costs may vary by ZIP code, city, or state.\n\nThe following table outlines the percentage change in assisted living median costs over the last decade.[01]\n\nYearPercentage change from the previous year20145.14%20151.76%20164.00%20172.56%20184.25%20192.16%2020-0.23%20211.86%20226.26%20237.61%\n\nIt’s important to note that all senior living costs are anticipated to continue to rise in response to inflation.\n\nAccording to data on A Place for Mom’s partner assisted living communities, the median cost of assisted living has increased since 2013, particularly in the years after the COVID-19 pandemic.[01] Between 2022 and 2023, the rate of inflation was 3.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.[03] Over the same period, the median cost of assisted living nationwide rose by 7.61%.[01]\n\nIt’s unclear at this point if assisted living costs will continue to increase at a rate that’s higher than the inflation rate.\n\nStates with the cheapest assisted living in 2024\n\nThe areas with the least expensive assisted living are usually located in the Mountain, Midwestern, and Southern states. These regions generally have a lower cost of living and cheaper housing costs.\n\nAccording to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data, these 10 states have the least expensive median assisted living cost in 2024:[02]\n\nWyoming: $3,642 per month\n\nAlabama: $3,696 per month\n\nMississippi: $3,757 per month\n\nLouisiana: $3,811 per month\n\nGeorgia: $4,152 per month\n\nUtah: $4,165 per month\n\nKentucky: $4,168 per month\n\nSouth Dakota: $4,205 per month\n\nArkansas: $4,253 per month\n\nSouth Carolina: $4,295 per month\n\nStates with the most expensive assisted living in 2024\n\nThe cost of assisted living is typically higher in the Northeast and Alaska, where the median monthly cost of a private room can surpass $6,000. These regions generally have a higher cost of living and more expensive housing prices.\n\nThese 10 states have the most expensive median cost of assisted living in 2024, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data:[02]\n\nNew Jersey: $7,000 per month\n\nNew Hampshire: $6,879 per month\n\nMassachusetts: $6,669 per month\n\nDelaware: $6,525 per month\n\nVermont: $6,495 per month\n\nAlaska: $6,285 per month\n\nConnecticut: $6,283 per month\n\nMaryland: $6,078 per month\n\nMaine: $5,915 per month\n\nNew York: $5,895 per month\n\nAlthough not a state, Washington, D.C., has a more expensive median cost of assisted living per month than any of the states listed above. The monthly median cost of assisted living is $7,250 per month in the nation’s capital.\n\nCan you afford assisted living?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your budget.\n\nAssisted living costs vary by state\n\nHow much an assisted living facility costs is related to that state’s cost of living index and assisted living regulations. Additionally, each assisted living community has its own design, levels of care, technology, location, and activities. All of these factors affect the cost of assisted living facilities in different states.\n\nAssisted living regulations\n\nAssisted living regulations vary widely across the U.S., unlike nursing homes, which are federally regulated.[04] As a result, states have different requirements for staffing levels, training, facility size, and safety. All of these are important factors that contribute to the cost of running a facility.\n\nFor example, take a look at the neighboring states of Missouri and Kansas, which have a difference in median monthly cost of $500.[02] In Kansas, the median cost of assisted living in 2024 is $5,205 per month. Kansas assisted living facilities must provide at least 200 square feet of living space in apartments, not including the bathroom and closets. The state doesn’t specify how many residents can occupy an apartment. In Missouri, the median cost of assisted living in 2024 is $4,700 per month. Missouri assisted living communities are required to provide a minimum of 70 square feet per resident in each unit. Missouri communities are allowed a maximum of four residents in a unit.[05]\n\nThis isn’t to say that apartment size is the reason for a price difference between Kansas and Missouri, but it illustrates the wide range of regulations that assisted living communities must follow from state to state.\n\nCost of living index\n\nA cost of living index compares what it takes to maintain a certain standard of living in a given location. Cost of living includes not only housing costs but also electricity, gas, water, taxes, food, and any expense related to living and thriving in that location.\n\nCost of living indexes typically center 100 as the national average, which means places with index numbers below 100 have a lower cost of living and places above 100 have a higher cost of living.\n\nA higher cost of living index number typically indicates that you can expect to see higher assisted living costs in that state. For example, many Northeastern states have high cost of living index numbers and more expensive median assisted living costs.\n\nStates with a lower cost of living typically have cheaper assisted living costs. In the Mountain, Midwestern, and Southern regions, a dollar goes further toward paying for the property, goods, and services needed to operate a senior living community.\n\nMedian monthly costs of assisted living in each state\n\nIf you’re wondering how much assisted living costs per month across the U.S., read through the table below. It outlines the median monthly and yearly base fee of a private, one-bedroom apartment in assisted living and notes the cost of living index by state.[06,07]\n\nStateMedian monthly price (2023)Median yearly price (2023)Cost of living index (2023)Alabama$3,696$44,35288.3Alaska$6,285$75,420125.2Arizona$4,575$54,900108.4Arkansas$4,253$75,42089California$5,270$68,240138.5Colorado$5,295$63,540105.1Connecticut$6,283$75,396112.8Delaware$6,525$78,300101.1Florida$4,310$51,720100.7Georgia$4,152$49,82490.8Hawaii$5,495$65,940180.3Idaho$4,559$54,70898.6Illinois$5,150$61,80092.1Indiana$4,348$52,17691Iowa$4,968$59,61690.3Kansas$5,205$62,46087.1Kentucky$4,168$45,73292Louisiana$3,811$47,78091Maine$5,915$70,980109.9Maryland$6,078$72,936116.5Massachusetts$6,669$80,028146.5Michigan$5,190$62,28090.6Minnesota$5,040$60,48094.1Mississippi$3,757$45,08486.3Missouri$4,700$56,40088.5Montana$4,840$58,080102.9Nebraska$5,042$60,50490.9Nevada$5,578$66,936101New Hampshire$6,879$82,548114.1New Jersey$7,000$84,000113.9New Mexico$4,395$52,74094New York$5,895$70,740125.9North Carolina$5,070$60,84095.3North Dakota$4,598$55,17694.6Ohio$4,995$59,94094.7Oklahoma$4,899$58,78886.2Oregon$5,760$69,120114.7Pennsylvania$5,000$60,00095.6Rhode Island$5,670$68,040110.7South Carolina$4,295$51,54095.3South Dakota$4,205$50,46092.4Tennessee$4,382$52,58490.3Texas$5,172$62,06492.7Utah$4,165$49,980103.2Vermont$6,495$77,940115.3Virginia$5,280$63,360101.9Washington, D.C.$7,250$87,000146.8Washington State$5,425$65,100116West Virginia$4,710$56,56087.7Wisconsin$5,410$64,92095.1Wyoming$3,642$43,70492.4\n\nDepending on the pricing model of the assisted living providers surveyed, the above figures may reflect base fees that don’t include extra services like assistance with activities of daily living, medication management, and more.\n\nAssisted living costs for a couple\n\nSome assisted living communities add an additional fee to the bill for couples living in the same assisted living apartment. This is typically referred to as a “second person fee,” and the national median cost in 2024 is $1,095 per month.[06]\n\nBroadly speaking, it’s challenging to calculate the cost of assisted living for couples because of the following factors:\n\nDifferent care needs of each partner\n\nDiffering health issues\n\nDifferent levels of supervision required by each partner\n\nIf you’re planning to live in assisted living as a couple, it’s a good idea to ask prospective communities how they approach fees for couples and if they offer any sort of couple discount.\n\nThe value of assisted living\n\nMany families are surprised by how much assisted living costs. This is largely because many families don’t consider the value they get for assisted living in comparison to current expenses.\n\nWe’ve developed a senior living cost calculator to help families accurately compare their loved one’s current expenses to the cost of assisted living. It helps to consider which expenses your loved one pays for individually at home that would be rolled into their monthly assisted living bill. These items often include:\n\nGroceries\n\nUtilities\n\nRent or mortgage\n\nHome repairs and maintenance\n\nTransportation\n\nThe “hidden” costs of assisted living\n\nDepending on a community’s pricing model, you may come across some fees that you didn’t expect. These surprises can be upsetting to some families, which is why they’re sometimes referred to as “hidden” fees.\n\nTypically, the base fee and other upfront costs of assisted living include the following:\n\nRent\n\nUtilities\n\nThree meals a day and snacks\n\nWeekly housekeeping and groundskeeping\n\nProgramming and activities\n\nCare coordination\n\nTransportation to and from doctor appointments\n\nWhile these known costs cover a lot, there are a few other potential costs to be aware of.\n\nCommunity fees\n\nMost communities have a one-time entrance fee, sometimes called a “community” or “move-in” fee. The national median community fee in 2024 is $2,500.[06]\n\nAdditional service fees\n\nResidents usually pay more for additional services. Many communities may provide an assisted living cost breakdown to prospective residents, with a variety of add-on expenses for assisted living.\n\nThe national median costs of common add-on fees in 2024 include:[06]\n\nMonthly medication fee: $500\n\nMonthly parking fee: $60\n\nMonthly pet fee: $300\n\nOther add-ons can also affect the monthly cost but will vary based on each senior’s needs and lifestyle. These add-ons may include:\n\nPhysical or occupational therapy services\n\nBeauty shop services or other special services\n\nClothing purchases\n\nInternet\n\nLaundry\n\nMedical fees and insurance\n\nSome transportation\n\nHelp with activities of daily living (ADLs) may also be an additional charge listed on the bill. This depends on how the community charges for this type of assistance, which is covered in detail below.\n\nThe typical pricing models in assisted living\n\nAssisted living communities typically operate under one of the following cost structures. These determine how you or your loved one pays for care, and they may influence how much you pay.\n\nA la carte pricing\n\nThis structure allows residents to add or remove services as their needs change, which provides flexibility for future needs. However, pricing a prospective community is more complex, as month-to-month assisted living costs may change over time.\n\nFor example, let’s say your loved one typically needs help with bathing and dressing. If they come to need extra assistance with mobility or toileting due to an illness or another reason, you’ll see a higher bill during that time.\n\nAll-inclusive pricing\n\nThis pricing structure includes everything from rent, care services, meals, and all other services and amenities available to residents of a community. This means costs won’t change if a senior develops greater needs — as long as the community offers the care level needed, like nursing or memory care.\n\nTiered pricing\n\nA community may offer different care levels at different price points. Prices typically rise with an increase in services. This type of pricing offers predictable costs and offers a resident options to upgrade to a higher level of care in the future without moving.\n\nMany times, tiers coordinate with the number of ADLs a senior needs help with or how many caregivers are needed to provide this assistance. The number of tiers available depends on the community, but it’s common to see anywhere between three and five tier options.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, the nationwide median prices for care tiers in 2024 are:[01]\n\n$550 per month for a low level of care\n\n$1,300 per month for a medium level of care\n\n$2,343 per month for a high level of care\n\nRead more:Understanding Assisted Living Levels of Care\n\nThe total cost an average resident spends on assisted living\n\nExpert advice for affordable assisted living\n\nTell us your care needs to receive options tailored to your budget.\n\nAssisted living costs compared to other care types\n\nFor some seniors, it may make sense to compare the costs of assisted living versus nursing home care. The chart below compares the median costs of different senior care types nationally, as collected from A Place for Mom’s (APFM) 2024 proprietary data[01] and Genworth’s 2023 data.[09]\n\nExpect costs to rise incrementally in the coming years due to inflation and the increased demand for senior living as most baby boomers reach retirement age by the end of the decade.\n\nCare typeLatest median daily cost (nationally)Latest median monthly cost (nationally)Latest median yearly cost (nationally)Nursing home facility, private room[09]$320$9,733$116,800Nursing home facility, semi-private room[09]$285$8,669$104,025Home health aide (based on 40 hours per week)[09]$188$5,720$68,640Homemaker services (based on 40 hours per week)[09]$172$5,200$62,400Assisted living facility[01]$164$4,995$59,940Memory care[01]$204$6,200$74,400Adult day health care[09]$95$2,058$24,700\n\nHome care can also be a good option to make sure your loved one has the support they need while you consider your care options. The national median cost of home care in 2024 is $30 per hour.[02] Depending on your loved one’s care needs, you can request a part-time or full-time caregiver.\n\nLiving at home or with family may be another viable option for seniors. However, all the unique variables make it difficult to determine the median cost of personal living arrangements.\n\nHow many people use nonresidential care types?\n\nAdult day services centers may be an option for seniors who remain at home. As of 2023, 4,130 centers in the U.S. provided care to more than 237,400 participants on any given day of that year.[10] The national median cost of adult day services is $17 per hour. Additionally, your loved one may have a day services medication fee, which has a national median cost of $300 per month.[06]\n\nPeople may also use home health care agencies to prolong their time living at home, as well. Throughout 2020, 3 million people received care from home health care agencies.[11]\n\nHow many people use residential care types?\n\nSeniors who choose a senior living option may start with assisted living. More than 818,000 people reside in assisted living communities. Approximately 60% of assisted living residents will eventually move out of their assisted living community and into a skilled nursing facility.[08]\n\nIn 2020, 1.3 million residents lived in nursing homes in the United States.[12] Long-term residents live in the nursing home for an average of 2.3 years.[13]\n\nIt can be challenging to determine how many people live in memory care, because “memory care” may refer to stand-alone communities or a type of service offered in units within assisted living communities. People with dementia may also reside in nursing homes because of their unique health situations.\n\nRead more:Assisted Living Alternatives: Your Care Options Explained\n\nWhat should I ask an assisted living community about pricing?\n\nRemember that assisted living costs will depend on every resident’s unique situation, so being as prepared and informed as possible can help your family avoid surprising costs and sticker shock.\n\nTo learn more about an assisted living community’s pricing, consider asking the following 10 questions:\n\nHow much does assisted living cost per month?\n\nIs this community all-inclusive?\n\nIf the community isn’t all-inclusive, what’s included in the base cost?\n\nAre there a la carte options to add to the base cost? How much do each of these options cost?\n\nAre there pricing tiers for levels of care?\n\nIs there a move-in fee or community fee? How much is it, and can we pay it over time?\n\nDoes the price increase annually?\n\nHow much does pricing vary by floor plan?\n\nWhat happens if my senior loved one’s care needs change and we need to move them to a higher level of care?\n\nWhat happens if our family can no longer pay?\n\nWhat payment options exist for assisted living?\n\nFiguring out how to pay for long-term care may feel overwhelming, but there may be multiple options available to your loved one. Some pathways to pay for assisted living include the following:\n\nInsurance.Long-term care insurance may pay for your loved one’s assisted living. However, each plan is different, so it’s best to contact the insurance provider for precise details.\n\nPrivate payment options. Your loved one or your family may opt to pay for assisted living with money from savings or retirement accounts.\n\nPublic payment options. Depending on your family member’s situation, they may qualify for some assistance through public payment options such as Medicaid.\n\nReal estate investments. Your loved one may be able to sell their home to pay for assisted living. If selling isn’t an option, they may be able to access funds through a reverse mortgage on their property.\n\nVeterans benefits. If your loved one served in the U.S. military or is a surviving spouse of someone who served, they may be eligible for VA benefits for long-term care.\n\nHow can I find assisted living options?\n\nNavigating the transition into assisted living may feel overwhelming, but you’re not alone. The specialized Senior Living Advisors at A Place for Mom offer free senior living consultations to help with your search for assisted living. These compassionate professionals can help you find local, assisted living options that may suit your loved one’s unique needs and situation, all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [Memory Care vs. Nursing Homes: What’s the Difference? by Nirali Desai on 2024-04-10](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-vs-nursing-homes)\nKey Takeaways\n\nBoth memory care and nursing homes provide personal care and close supervision, but nursing homes also provide skilled nursing care.\n\nMemory care caters to seniors with memory loss with design features that minimize confusion and staff that receive specialized training in dementia care.\n\nMemory care can be combined with skilled nursing because some nursing homes offer a specialized memory care unit to care for individuals with dementia.\n\nNursing home care is more expensive than memory care because of the higher level of personal and medical care.\n\nWhat to expect in memory care\n\nMemory care communities provide 24-hour specialized care for people with memory loss. Residents typically receive meals and help with activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, and medication management.\n\nAdditional features typically include person-centered care, unique memory care programming, and secure design features to improve residents’ safety and quality of life.\n\nStaff trained in dementia care\n\nMemory care communities require specialized training and, sometimes, certifications for staff caregivers. Once properly trained, memory care staff recognize and cope with common dementia behaviors and symptoms, such as:\n\nSundown syndrome\n\nConfusion\n\nWandering\n\nAnger or aggression\n\nAgitation\n\nHallucinations\n\nRead more:Memory Classes and Staff Training\n\nSpecialized programming\n\nActivities in memory care are carefully selected to help engage seniors’ brains, soothe common dementia symptoms, and improve seniors’ overall health.\n\nMemory care programs often include the following therapies and activities:\n\nSensory and reminiscence therapies (music, scent, taste, light, art, and pet therapies)\n\nBrain fitness activities (puzzles, memory games, etc.)\n\nFitness activities (chair yoga, tai chi, walking club, etc.)\n\nSafe, secure environments\n\nSafety is a key priority at memory care facilities, and they’re often equipped with built-in safety features. These may include locked and alarmed exit doors to prevent wandering.\n\nMemory care communities are also designed to reduce confusion and create a homelike environment for seniors with memory loss. The following architectural and design features are common in memory care facilities:\n\nColor-coded walls\n\nClearly defined shared spaces\n\nEnclosed gardens or courtyards\n\nPersonalized memory boxes outside residents’ doors\n\nKeypad entrances for family or staff\n\nWhat to expect in nursing homes\n\nNursing homes provide 24-hour skilled nursing care and supervision, meals, and assistance with activities of daily living to individuals who have serious health issues or chronic conditions. Like most memory care facilities, they offer activities, but they’re typically not as personalized and robust.\n\nShort-term or long-term care\n\nThere are typically two types of care options available in nursing homes:\n\nShort-term care. Skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services are available to people recovering from an illness, surgery, or acute injury. These services are typically provided at skilled nursing facilities, which specifically accommodate shorter stays.\n\nLong-term care. Long-term care is available to people with cognitive disorders, terminal illnesses, or chronic medical conditions.\n\nSkilled nursing services\n\nIn addition to robust personal care assistance, nursing homes provide skilled care services. These services must be provided by registered nurses or other trained, licensed professionals under the supervision of a doctor. Most memory care communities cannot legally provide this level of care.\n\nNursing homes offer the following skilled services to help seniors improve or maintain their health:\n\nMedication management and administration\n\nWound care\n\nIV therapies\n\nRespiratory therapy\n\nRehabilitative therapies (speech, occupational, and physical)\n\nStrict admission requirements\n\nNursing home care requires a physician’s prescription and physical exam before a resident can move in.\n\nSeniors may qualify for nursing home care in the following situations:\n\nThey need rehabilitative services.\n\nThey require continuous supervision.\n\nThey need significant help with daily activities, such as walking, eating, bathing, and dressing.\n\nThey need frequent assistance managing health conditions and medications.\n\nNursing homes are subject to both federal and state regulations. Therefore, it’s important to check with your state’s Medicaid agency or licensing agency for more specific information.\n\nRead more:Nursing Home Requirements for Seniors\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nNursing home vs. memory care: What services are offered?\n\nTo help you get an overview of what to expect, here’s a comparison of services that can be found in nursing homes and memory care facilities:\n\nServicesMemory CareNursing HomesMeal servicesxxHousekeeping and laundry servicesxxSocial activitiesxxMedication managementxxHelp with daily activities (ADLs)xxSpecialized care for patients with memory lossxx24-hour care and supervisionxxSecured entrances and exits to prevent wanderingxxRehabilitative therapies as neededxMemory-enhancing therapiesxUnique facility layout and design to reduce confusionxTransportation to appointmentsx\n\nCombining memory care with skilled nursing\n\nSometimes the difference between memory care and a nursing home can get blurry — especially when these two care types are combined. If your loved one has significant health issues besides dementia, you may wonder if they can receive memory care services within a nursing home. In short, yes, they can.\n\nIndividuals with dementia can receive skilled nursing services along with memory care in these settings:\n\nContinuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). These communities offer multiple levels of care in one convenient location. Independent living, assisted living, memory care, and nursing home care may all be available on the same campus. This unique care option allows seniors with dementia to transition into memory care and access necessary skilled nursing services on an as-needed basis with minimal disruption.\n\nMemory care units within a nursing home. Some nursing homes designate a separate space or wing in the facility to accommodate the needs of residents with memory loss.[01] In a nursing home memory care unit, staff members typically have specialized training, and residents receive a higher level of medical care than in a stand-alone memory care facility.\n\n“Oftentimes, families turn to skilled nursing when they run out of funding for private pay options like memory care,” says Rachel Levy, a senior national account manager at A Place for Mom with over two decades of senior living experience. “Another reason could be that the needs of a memory care resident exceed the state regulations of memory care or assisted living. For instance, if a resident can no longer feed themselves, they’d need to move to a nursing home.”\n\nCost of memory care vs. nursing homes\n\nThe national median cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to A Place for Mom’s 2024 report on the cost of long-term care.[02] On the other hand, the national median cost of a nursing home is $8,669 per month for a semi-private room and $9,733 per month for a private room.[03]\n\nMany factors affect the cost of memory care communities and nursing homes:\n\nLocation. Some cities and states, such as New York and California, have a higher cost of living and different requirements that affect the overall cost.\n\nServices provided. Services vary among communities. For example, personalized services to accommodate unique health care or dietary needs may cost more.\n\nType of unit. In many nursing homes and memory care facilities, residents can choose a private room or a shared room. Living with a roommate can help reduce long-term care expenses.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nHow to decide between memory care and a nursing home\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: CHOOSING MEMORY CARE OR A NURSING HOME\n\nI recommend talking to a potential memory care community’s nursing staff about your family member’s needs. They’ll likely perform a free assessment, which can help indicate whether your family member would fit better in a memory care community or a nursing home.\n\nIf you’re unsure about what’s best for your loved one, talk with your family, your elderly loved one, and their doctor or case manager to better understand their unique care needs and local care options.\n\nA Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can also help you navigate care options based on your loved one’s location, preferences, and needs — all at no cost to your family.

      "# [Assisted Living vs. Nursing Homes: Care, Services, and Costs by Claire Samuels on 2024-05-15](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-nursing-homes)\nAssisted living communities offer services and amenities to keep residents as healthy, socially engaged, and independent as possible. While nursing homes offer similar amenities, their main focus is providing round-the-clock medical care to treat more serious health issues.\n\nA key feature of nursing homes, skilled nursing care means that trained medical professionals are available at all times to assist your loved one. If your family member has a serious medical condition, they may need specialized care from licensed health care professionals at a skilled nursing facility. Assisted living senior care aides are highly trained but may not be medically certified.\n\n“Assisted living services are geared toward those who may need some support from staff along with meals and socialization. Therefore, these facilities focus on many different types of activities and entertainment,” says Carol Bradley Bursack, a senior living expert, caregiver, and author of Minding Our Elders: Caregivers Share Their Personal Stories.\n\n“Nursing homes try to offer activities that nourish their residents, but due to their focus on providing actual health care to often severely ill or compromised people, they are, by nature, more medical in their approach,” Bursack explains.\n\nA Place for Mom partners with assisted living communities across the country. The following is a list of the most common services and amenities that our partners provide, as well as the percentage of communities that offer them:[01]\n\n95% provide on-site activities that cater to residents’ interests.\n\n82% offer full medication management.\n\n80% provide housekeeping.\n\n76% provide laundry services.\n\n74% offer off-site activities.\n\n72% offer pet-friendly accommodations.\n\n71% provide complimentary transportation.\n\n66% offer restaurant-style dining.\n\n58% have apartments with kitchenettes.\n\nAdditionally, some of our partner communities offer more advanced care services. These include the following:[01]\n\n80% offer on-site hospice care.\n\n61% have on-site nursing.\n\n29% provide wound care.\n\n8% have a skilled nursing facility located on-site.\n\nNursing homes typically offer more advanced medical care services, such as:\n\nOngoing palliative and preventative long-term care\n\nPrescription medication administration, including injections\n\nDialysis\n\nSpecialized rehabilitative services, such as speech, occupational, physical, respiratory, cognitive, and vocational therapy\n\nEmergency and routine dental services\n\nMeal options that must meet the daily nutritional requirements and the unique dietary needs of each resident, including pureed and liquid diets\n\nIncreased safety features and security benefits\n\nMost of the time, medical care services are offered in the community by external companies contracted by the facility. Many modern assisted living facilities may do this as well for already established residents, so that when the time comes, residents won’t have to move to another facility.\n\n“A typical assisted living resident is someone who needs some extra assistance along with meals and socializing,” Bursack says. “Depending on the facility, extra services can be added to the package so that those who need more care can remain there longer. Alternatively, people who need significant medical care from nurses and physicians may qualify for a nursing home. This could include someone who has had a major stroke, a disabling fall, or a chronic disease.”\n\nWhich care type will your loved one benefit from the most? For families needing to choose between assisted living and nursing home care, Bursack offers the following advice.\n\n“If the older adult is relatively self-sufficient but needs extra support for safety and possibly more socialization, then assisted living is likely the right choice. However, if your loved one has significant challenges with activities of daily living, such as dressing or feeding themselves, or has a severe or chronic illness, it’s good to work with a doctor to see what care is best for them.”\n\nAssisted living is an ideal choice for seniors who may:\n\nRequire minor nursing assistance but don’t need full-time medical care\n\nNeed help with daily activities, such as dressing and bathing\n\nHave interest in a maintenance-free lifestyle without lawn care or home repairs\n\nDesire an active lifestyle but don’t have access to transportation\n\nWant to make new friends or find social activities, like art classes\n\nHave good health but know they may need more help soon\n\nA nursing home is an ideal choice for seniors who may:\n\nRequire constant care due to chronic conditions or deteriorating health\n\nBe unable to feed themselves independently\n\nHave significant mobility concerns\n\nHave experienced an injury or fall and need significant rehabilitation\n\nHave progressive conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis\n\nRequire regular injections for diabetes or other conditions",
      "# [Term Care and Senior Living by State in 2024](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living-data/long-term-care-costs)\nAs the nation’s largest senior living advisory service, A Place for Mom aims to help seniors and their families find the best care fit for their individual needs. Only about 34% of families surveyed by A Place for Mom were prepared for senior living costs in 2023, while over 60% found cost and financing information helpful when selecting a community. The data presented in this report paints a clear picture of how much seniors pay for care.\n\nWe’ve worked with providers from our network of over 17,000 senior living partner communities and home care agencies to compile long-term care cost data so families know what to expect. The metrics shared below reflect actual costs paid by seniors living in A Place for Mom’s partner communities in 2023, except where noted. Monthly senior living prices are all-inclusive based on the care and amenities each community offers. Home care costs are calculated as hourly rates, since monthly totals can vary based on the amount of contracted care a senior needs.\n\nWhile many families search for average long-term care costs, this report mainly uses median costs. That means that half of providers charge more than the given number, while half of providers charge less. Median costs are less likely to be affected by very high or very low prices.\n\nApartment size and layout can impact the cost of senior living as well. For example, a cozy studio in assisted living, memory care, or independent living is likely to be less expensive than a spacious one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartment.\n\nThe following chart shows median monthly starting prices for the most common floor plans in senior living communities across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Starting rent prices are reported by communities in our partner network and most do not include additional fees for things like care services or pets.\n\nLearn how A Place for Mom established costs based on median values, collection periods, and sample size.\n\nNational and state median cost data\n\nA Place for Mom compiled data from three types of senior living: assisted living, memory care, and independent living. We collected monthly cost data at the time of each senior’s move-in and over the subsequent year to paint a comprehensive picture of how much families pay for an all-inclusive senior living experience. Since first-month upfront costs can be different from subsequent monthly fees, we use an average of that one-year period to establish the most comprehensive, correct monthly costs. Data used in this report was collected throughout 2023.\n\nMemory care (sample size: 11,506 family move-ins). Monthly memory care expenses reflected in this report’s data include room and board, personal care services from staff trained in dementia care, and community fees for services, amenities, and safety features.\n\nAssisted living (sample size: 28,301 family move-ins). Monthly assisted living costs include rent, three nutritious meals a day, scheduled activities, and medication management services.\n\nIndependent living (sample size: 13,481 family move-ins). Independent living costs cover room and board, as well as community amenities and maintenance.\n\nHome care cost data is based on starting hourly rates reported in 2023 by 767 of A Place for Mom’s home care partners. Actual costs depend on the level of care a senior needs and the hours of care they contract per week. Most home care agencies require a weekly minimum of seven hours, and some offer up to 24-hour or live-in care options. The industry standard for “full-time” care is 44 nonsleeping hours per week, which equates to $5,720 a month based on the national median hourly rate from A Place for Mom’s network of home care providers.",
      "# [Loss of Appetite in the Elderly by Sarah Falcone on 2023-12-21](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/appetite-loss)\nKey Takeaways\n\nLoss of appetite affects one in four older adults. Lifestyle changes, hormonal imbalance, or medical conditions can cause it.\n\nNot eating enough can cause nutritional deficiencies. This can put seniors at an increased risk for frailty, falls, and joint issues.\n\nYou can improve a senior's appetite in several ways. You can offer frequent snacks, nutrient-dense foods, or make meals a social event.\n\nAlways report significant appetite changes to a doctor. If at-home remedies aren't working, doctors may recommend appetite stimulants, in-home care, or senior living for increased care needs.\n\nWhat happens when the elderly don’t eat enough?\n\nWhen the elderly stop eating, it can cause weight loss and nutritional deficiencies, potentially leading to serious health problems, including a risk for increased mortality and impaired immune function.[01] Other consequences of nutritional deficiencies and weight loss may include an increased risk of:\n\nFrailty and falls\n\nPressure sores\n\nLonger length of hospital stay\n\nJoint issues\n\nHip fracture\n\nBecause loss of appetite among seniors is common, we asked dietitian and nutrition specialist Heather Garza to share advice for caregivers worried about elderly adults not eating.\n\n“I remind my clients often that a loss of appetite and thirst is a normal part of aging and doesn’t always mean something is wrong,” said Garza.\n\nYet, sometimes a sudden loss of appetite in elderly adults can be more severe and require treatment. If you notice unexplained weight loss or weight gain, general lethargy, or changes in your loved one’s eating habits that persist for more than one week, the first step is to consult their doctor.\n\nTop 7 age-related reasons why elderly adults stop eating\n\nYou may be wondering “what causes loss of appetite in the elderly?” Well, aging brings many physiological and lifestyle changes that can cause a sudden loss of appetite. Research found that one in four seniors suffer from appetite loss.[02] Typical causes for elderly appetite loss include the following:\n\nA lower metabolic rate and less physical activity mean seniors need fewer calories.\n\nChanges in the senses of smell and taste can make food less desirable. We also lose taste buds as we get older.\n\nHormone changes can alter the hunger signals to the brain. Older adults typically don’t feel hungry as often as they once did.\n\nDental problems or gastrointestinal changes, such as lactose intolerance, can accompany aging and make eating uncomfortable.\n\nAn inability to prepare meals particularly affects seniors who live independently and experience difficulty cooking or using kitchen utensils and appliances.\n\nA lack of or changes in a daily routine can cause discomfort or confusion around meal times.\n\nLoneliness or isolation can lead to decreased appetite, especially if a person recently lost a loved one or moved to a new environment.\n\nTop 10 medical causes for loss of appetite in the elderly\n\nSometimes what causes a loss of appetite in the elderly isn’t aging — it could be a medical condition. Here’s a list of common health problems that may cause an elderly person to stop eating:\n\nDepression\n\nDementia symptoms\n\nSide effects from medications\n\nInsomnia or other sleep problems can mean less energy to cook\n\nLess common, albeit serious, underlying causes when a senior stops eating may also be the culprit. These could include:\n\nParkinson’s disease\n\nHead and neck cancers\n\nMouth and throat infections\n\nPeriodontal disease\n\nSalivary gland dysfunction\n\nThyroid disorders\n\nCan medications cause loss of appetite in the elderly?\n\nYes, elderly appetite loss could signal a problem with the medicines a person is taking. Medication side effects such as dry mouth may occur in seniors. Dry mouth occurs when the salivary glands don’t produce enough saliva, causing food to taste different and swallowing to be difficult.\n\n“Chewing sugarless gum, brushing often, or using an oral rinse before meals can improve taste sensation and, ultimately, nutrient intake,” Garza said.\n\nAnother reason why older adults stop eating could be changes in the taste of their food. Certain medications can make foods taste different than normal, giving off bitter or metallic notes.[03] Medications that cause elderly loss of appetite may include:\n\nAntibiotics, including ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and others\n\nNeurologic medications like those used to treat Parkinson’s or migraines and many muscle relaxants\n\nHeart medications, including some blood pressure medicines, diuretics, statins for cholesterol, and medicines for heart arrhythmias\n\nEndocrines that are often used in thyroid medications\n\nPsychiatric medications, including some antidepressants and mood stabilizers\n\nOther medications, including chemotherapy drugs, prescriptions for smoking cessation, and bronchodilators\n\nIf your loved one says their food tastes “off” or metallic, try switching to other protein sources such as dairy or beans. If water doesn’t taste right to them, add herbs like mint or basil. Or try sliced fruits or vegetables, such as lemon and cucumber, as water infusions can help prevent dehydration in seniors.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nHow to get the elderly to eat: 7 appetite-stimulating tips\n\nWhether your aging loved one’s lack of appetite is standard or related to a medical condition, you can do a few practical things to naturally stimulate their appetite and help them get adequate nutrition.\n\n1. Exercise\n\nGetting regular exercise increases the amount of energy a person burns. In turn, this can increase the body’s need for fuel, which boosts hunger levels.\n\n2. Plan and schedule meals\n\n“Our bodies tend to thrive off regularity, as do our hunger and thirst signals, so when we stray from our usual patterns, so does our appetite,” Garza said.\n\nProper planning can help people consume enough calories each day.[04] To help your loved one reach their goals, try these practical tips:\n\nConsider eating six to eight little meals instead of three big meals daily.\n\nFigure out the time of day when their appetite is strongest, and eat at that time.\n\nEven if they’re not hungry, try to encourage meals and snacks at the same times every day.\n\nPlace healthful items around the house to promote regular snacking.\n\nIf your parent is living alone, consider hiring an in-home caregiver who can help with meal planning and preparation. Home care aides can even handle grocery shopping to further reduce stress.\n\n3. Choose foods wisely\n\nSometimes the quality of the food a person takes in is more important than the quantity, but it can be tough for them to think of meal options when they don’t feel like eating. Follow these food selection tips to encourage a senior’s appetite and boost their calorie intake:\n\nAvoid loading up on high-fiber, low-calorie foods like raw fruits and vegetables at meals. Consult your doctor about the advantages of a low-fiber diet.\n\nAdd sweet fruit or full-fat ice cream to increase the flavor and nutritional value of milkshakes and desserts.\n\nTry drinking the calories instead. Encourage at least one smoothie, protein shake, or high-calorie nutritional supplement drink.\n\nServe proteins one hour or more after removing them from the refrigerator; some enjoy the taste of these foods at room temperature.\n\n4. Increase nutrient density, not portion size\n\nIt may be tempting to offer large plates of food, but huge helpings of food can be intimidating. Instead, focus on providing calorie-rich options.\n\n“I ask caregivers not to increase the volume of food they serve to seniors with low appetites,” Garza explained. “Rather, increase the nutrient density of the foods they serve.”\n\nAvocados, olive oil, and peanut butter are examples of nutrient-dense foods packed with “healthy fats.”\n\n5. Consider appetite stimulants for the elderly\n\nSome seniors stop eating because they’re not interested in food. Ghrelin, known as the “hunger hormone,” regulates appetite. Studies suggest that ghrelin production slows down as we age.[05] Unfortunately, weight loss, malnutrition, and frailty often occur when seniors don’t eat enough.\n\nOne way to counter this natural part of aging is through prescription appetite stimulants. Talk to your doctor to determine if this is a good option for your loved one. They can review the pros and cons, including side effects and suitability, in light of a senior’s overall health.\n\nThough it might be normal when an older adult seems to be eating less, you should still seek medical advice if your loved one refuses to eat. A doctor can give valuable advice on encouraging a healthy diet so that you can help them get the vitamins and minerals they need.\n\n6. Make mealtimes more enjoyable\n\nWhen your loved one looks forward to mealtime, they may be inclined to eat more. Encourage seniors to implement one or more of these suggestions to make mealtime more enjoyable:\n\nChoose nutritious recipes that are tasty and enjoyable for them.\n\nAdd extra flavor with herbs, spices, sauces, or marinades.\n\nUse garnishes and colorful foods to make meals more appealing.\n\nChange the menu regularly to avoid getting bored with a particular food.\n\nWatch a favorite television show or movie while cooking or eating.\n\nPlay music while preparing food or eating.\n\nSet the table using your favorite place settings.\n\nTry different-sized plates to see what works best.\n\n7. Encourage social meals\n\nMake mealtimes a social event; research suggests eating with others increases food intake.[06]Eating alone may seem unappealing to people of all ages, but seniors may be unable to have meals with others due to mobility problems, lack of transportation, or losing a spouse.\n\n“Senior centers, temples or churches, and community centers may have weekly dinners and other mealtime events for seniors,” said Garza. Encourage meal “dates” with friends, family, or caregivers.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nTips for older or less mobile adults\n\nOlder adults or people with limited mobility can face challenges when it comes to appetite and weight loss. The following tips may help address some of these challenges:\n\nUse grocery or meal delivery services if going out to get food is difficult.\n\nSet an alarm for mealtimes if forgetting to eat is an issue.\n\nEnsure that dentures fit correctly to avoid pain or discomfort while eating.\n\nInvest in adaptive utensils if joint pain or dexterity is a problem.\n\nTry to visit an occupational therapist or dietitian for assistance.\n\nSenior living communities can help regulate appetite\n\nFor seniors with health conditions, it can still be difficult to maintain consistent, healthy eating habits. If you’re worried about a senior loved one’s health at home, you may want to consider an assisted living or memory care community, depending on their care needs.\n\nSenior living communities strive to meet the dietary and preferential needs of each resident by offering various dining options. They often have on-site dieticians or nutritionists who craft meal plans and menus that help seniors get all the basic nutrients they need. Some communities even offer specialized meal plans for seniors with dietary restrictions.\n\nOther benefits include an increase in appetite due to dining with others, caregivers who help seniors who may have trouble eating, and scheduled meal times. Some communities also have any-time dining or in-room meal service for seniors who are used to different eating schedules.\n\nIn the end, a senior’s loss of appetite might be due to aging, medical conditions, or the side effects of medications. Regardless, it’s important to address this issue in your senior loved one, as it can increase their risk of illness or other complications.\n\nRegular exercise, socializing more during meals, certain medications, and other lifestyle changes are all safe and effective ways to increase your loved one’s appetite. However, if you notice that this change in appetite persists for more than a few days, it’s essential to seek help. Your doctor can determine any underlying causes and recommend a course of action.",
      "# [11 Benefits of Assisted Living for Seniors by Claire Samuels on 2024-06-06](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-benefits)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living provides personalized care around the clock. Each resident has a care plan and caregivers are available to help overnight.\n\nAssisted living offers residents a healthy lifestyle. Chef-prepared meals and on-site exercise classes encourage both body and brain health.\n\nAssisted living communities are safe and secure. Unique features help prevent falls, while on-site alarms and security companies keep seniors safe.\n\nOn-site activities and outings keep seniors engaged. From book clubs and happy hours to shopping trips and entertainment, communities offer a range of activities to appeal to residents.\n\n1. Personalized care plans\n\nOne of the key assisted living benefits is help with activities of daily living (ADLs). This can mean anything from occasional assistance getting dressed to daily help bathing. Many assisted living communities offer different levels of care, designed to make sure that each senior gets the help they need without losing their independence. To make sure that each senior’s needs are met, communities assess care needs for new residents up-front and then on a regular basis thereafter.\n\nHealth-related benefits of assisted living communities include:\n\nCaregiver aid. Caregivers and nurses can help with a variety of daily activities, from bathing to escorting residents to dining areas and activities.\n\nMedication management. Keeping track of prescriptions ensures seniors take the right medicines at the right times of day, preventing dangerous mismanagement.\n\nSenior care coordination. Transportation to doctor’s appointments and some on-site medical services help seniors stay on top of important health care needs. Plus, nurses and staff members can observe any health changes.\n\nOn-call nurses or trained staff. Staff members are available and trained to respond to emergencies or contact ambulance transport.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\n2. 24-hour care\n\nWhile seniors may need the most help during the day, caregivers at assisted living communities are available 24/7. For instance, if your loved one needs help to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, they can easily get the assistance they need.\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that most communities have fewer caregivers available at night than during the day. Some communities rely on technology to help supervise residents overnight, such as a medical alert pendant or emergency pull cords.\n\n3. Activities and social events\n\nAfter retirement, seniors may be overwhelmed by free time. These extra hours can be used to pursue passions or pick up new hobbies. One of the top benefits of assisted living is a number of activities that appeal to all walks of life. Consider these pursuits available at most of our partner assisted living communities:\n\nMovie nights offer classic entertainment with favorite films, popcorn, and snacks.\n\nCommunal gardens give older adults the opportunity to spend time outside.\n\nArt and music classes teach new skills and encourage creativity.\n\nPoker and card tournaments engage seniors in friendly competition.\n\nBook clubs promote discussions between friends.\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\n4. Intellectual stimulation\n\nMental stimulation may lower the risk of dementia and long-term cognitive decline. Opportunities for lifelong learning are among the many benefits of assisted living communities. From lending libraries and language lessons to woodworking shops and religious services, there are plenty of opportunities for seniors to stay engaged. Assisted living communities often offer the following supportive services for residents:\n\nWays to combat dementia. Communities provide residents access to stimulating resources and brain games designed to slow cognitive decline.\n\nAcademic activities. Guest lecturers and local professors may visit assisted living communities to speak about popular topics like art history or flower arranging. Some communities are even located on a college campus.\n\nTechnology assistance. Computer rooms and personal tablets are often available, and community staff can help seniors develop technical skills. Alexa-enabled devices may be available in some communities, too.\n\n5. Scheduled outings\n\nIn addition to on-site activities, many communities organize group outings or excursions that residents look forward to, like:\n\nGroup shopping trips\n\nMuseum tours\n\nVisits to local attractions.\n\nSeasonal activities, local festivals, and special exhibits\n\nReligious services\n\nLive performances, concerts, or trips to the movies\n\nMost communities base their outings on residents’ interests, and seniors can participate whenever they’d like. Note, though, that outings may cost extra.\n\n6. Maintenance-free living\n\nIn addition to care, assisted living residents can receive help with daily household chores. This can be a relief for families who worry about all the work that goes into maintaining a home. Assisted living communities typically provide the following types of on-site services:\n\nHousekeeping\n\nGroundskeeping\n\nLaundry\n\nMeals and snacks\n\nApartment maintenance\n\n7. Safety features\n\nKeeping seniors healthy and safe stands out as one of the main assisted living benefits that spurs caregivers to seek a new home for their loved one. Some safety-related advantages of assisted living facilities include:\n\nMinimized fall risks. Falls can lead to serious injuries and health complications in seniors. Assisted living facilities are designed for accessibility and mobility, with ramps, flat thresholds, and hallway hand railings.\n\nSafer bathrooms. Raised toilets, specially designed walk-in showers, and grab bars in bathrooms also reduce the likelihood of falls.\n\nOn-call staff. Emergency call buttons in assisted living apartments are used to notify staff in case of falls or injuries. This means seniors don’t have to struggle to contact help or wait to be found after a medical event at home.\n\n8. Increased security\n\nSeniors living alone may be more vulnerable to security risks. Here are just some of the increased security features assisted living communities provide:\n\nAlarms and security officers. Elderly people are often targets for break-ins and scams. Senior living communities use security companies and alarm systems to provide peace of mind.\n\nDisaster preparation. Assisted living staff maintain smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms, and fire extinguishers — something that a senior alone at home would need to maintain. And, in the event of a tornado, earthquake, or fire, staff members can help seniors get to safety.\n\nAssisted living questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\n9. Healthy, restaurant-style dining\n\nElderly adults have unique nutrition needs, which can be quite a challenge to meet for seniors living at home. The task of preparing healthy, balanced meals may be the responsibility of family members, meal delivery services, or seniors themselves. Here’s what residents can typically expect in assisted living communities in terms of meal planning:\n\nAll-inclusive dining. Residents can enjoy three meals a day plus snacks as a benefit of assisted living. These meals are generally served in a restaurant-style dining room or may be delivered to individual apartments when necessary.\n\nHealthy, balanced meals. Assisted living communities often have on-site dietitians and chefs who craft meals that support both body and brain health. These meals are designed to incorporate important vitamins and nutrients for seniors.\n\nKnowledge about special diets. Special diets are necessary for seniors with a variety of medical conditions. Assisted living chefs are familiar with low-sodium diets, diabetic needs, and diets for people with high cholesterol. Some communities may also offer vegetarian, halal, kosher, gluten-free, or other options.\n\n10. A more active lifestyle, without the effort\n\nA lack of exercise can lead to physical and mental decline. Keeping seniors active can benefit muscle and bone health and reduce the likelihood of falls. Physical activity keeps aging adults healthy longer, improves cognitive function, and is a great social outlet. Some physical benefits of assisted living include:\n\nOn-site, convenient classes. Organizing transportation to fitness classes or physical therapy can be difficult. One of the advantages of assisted living facilities is that everything is located within the community, which makes attendance easy.\n\nActivities for every skill level and ability. Assisted living activity coordinators know that each senior has a different level of physical ability. A dance class may include more complicated steps for residents who are mobile along with a chair modification for those with lower ranges of motion.\n\nSafe, supervised exercises. Activity coordinators know how to keep seniors safe and provide appropriate supervision during classes.\n\n11. A range of amenities\n\nDesirable and useful features are unique to each assisted living community. Look for specific amenities that are important to your loved one, like a swimming pool or other features. You may find some unexpected amenities that appeal to your parent during your search. Keep in mind that some amenities may affect your overall monthly bill. Luxury assisted living communities, for example, offer fresh architectural designs and specialty features that come with an increased cost.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, you’ll find a variety of amenities such as:[01]\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nButterfly or hummingbird gardens\n\nCommon areas like a library, computer room, and movie theater\n\nBars, pubs, and cafes separate from the main dining room\n\nHobby spaces such as a woodworking shop, arts and crafts room, and putting green\n\nJacuzzi or whirlpool\n\nIndoor or outdoor pool\n\nOn-site places of worship for religious services\n\nConcierge\n\nAs you consider your options, keep in mind that using some amenities may cost extra if they come with a service charge.\n\nUnderstand the benefits of assisted living for your loved one\n\nIf you think your family member could benefit from assisted living, reach out to one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors.
