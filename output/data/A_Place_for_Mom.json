      "# [What Is Senior Living? Costs, Benefits and Options by Jess Mathews on 2024-02-19](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living)\nSenior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:\n\nSenior apartments and independent living communities: The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.\n\nHome care and assisted living communities: The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.\n\nMemory care: The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.\n\nNursing homes: The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.\n\nThe costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.\n\nSenior living options range from senior apartments and other 55+ communities to nursing homes. The biggest difference between each option is the level of care they provide to residents.\n\nFor independent seniors who don’t need assistance, senior apartments or independent living may be the right fit. Active seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs) may strike a balance of independence and support in assisted living communities or board and care homes. However, seniors with complex health conditions or a form of dementia may benefit more from memory care communities or nursing homes.\n\nDepending on the needs of the senior, home care or home health care may be a good fit. Home care services can provide companionship and daily support, while home health care services can offer prescribed in-home skilled nursing care.\n\nTypically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.\n\nKnowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from A Place for Mom’s 2024 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\n\nWhen it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.\n\nFinding the right senior living option comes down to three questions: What are your needs, what are your retirement goals, and what is your budget? Knowing the answer to these questions should help you narrow down which option will fit your family’s needs best. For example, if your loved one doesn’t require care services, but wants to pursue new hobbies and make new friendships, independent living might be a better option than a senior apartment or assisted living environment.\n\nAbove all else, the best way to determine which senior living option is best is to tour. Touring allows families to meet community staff and residents, ask questions, evaluate floor plans, and truly get a sense of what life in that community would look like. According to our data, 97% of families tour before making a final decision about their senior living options.\n\nMoving can be a big adjustment, which is why it’s best to plan ahead. Consider the significant change you or a senior loved one will go through. A successful move is key for a positive transition into a new environment and lifestyle.\n\nBelow are some top tips for an easy senior living move:\n\nChoose one room at a time for packing and downsizing.\n\nConsider hiring a professional senior relocation service.\n\nWork with a geriatric care manager to make sure there is e access to health care providers and prescriptions after the move.\n\nConsider mobility needs to find the best way to travel, whether by car or plane.",
      "# [What Is Memory Care? Services, Cost, and Benefits by seanleong on 2024-02-09](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care)\nMemory care is a type of long-term care community designed to meet the specific needs of individuals with a dementia diagnosis, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Memory care facilities offer 24-hour care and supervision, secured environments, specialized staff trained in dementia care, and memory-enhancing activities and therapies. Memory care can take place in apartment-like facilities, within a wing of an assisted living facility, or in smaller residential care homes. The goal of memory care is to provide an engaging, safe, and therapeutic environment for seniors with dementia to support their well-being and improve their quality of life. Individuals in the middle to later stages of dementia benefit most from a memory care environment.\n\nBenefits of memory care\n\nBecause dementia symptoms worsen over time, elderly adults with dementia are often unable to continue to live independently in their homes. If a family member is unable to take on the caregiver role, which can quickly become a full-time job, memory care is a great option. Memory care not only benefits seniors with dementia but also families who are feeling overwhelmed by their loved one’s advanced care needs. It gives families peace of mind that their loved one is in a secure and therapeutic environment with caregivers trained to handle difficult dementia behaviors.\n\nRead on to learn all about memory care benefits, specialized services, costs, and payment options. We also offer free tips on finding and moving to a community in your area.\n\nThe median national cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to proprietary data gathered by A Place for Mom. Costs vary greatly between communities and depend on factors like location, community amenities, programming, apartment size, and the level of care a senior requires. Pricing models also vary. For instance, some memory care communities may be all-inclusive, while others may use an a la carte approach and charge based on services required by a resident.\n\nMemory care base costs typically cover rent, utilities, meals and snacks, housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, on-site activities, nonmedical therapies, and shared amenities. However, some amenities — such as in-unit internet service, beauty and barber services, laundry, and pet accommodations — may cost extra.\n\nWhile many families look to savings to finance senior care, there are other little-known funding sources that can help. The articles below can help you better understand pricing and the options available to help pay for memory care.",
      "# [What is a Nursing Home? Services, Cost and Options by Grace Hobson on 2024-02-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes)\nNursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for seniors. Nursing homes offer the highest level of care for seniors who need long-term or short-term medical care but don’t need hospitalization. Elderly adults who need long-term care at a nursing home often have severe physical or cognitive health conditions that require 24-hour nursing care. They may be incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to transfer from bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a staff member.\n\nNursing homes play a crucial role in post-hospitalization care. They offer short-term rehabilitation for seniors recovering from illnesses, accidents or surgery. Rehab care focuses on restoring mobility, strength, and function so seniors can get back to their normal activities.\n\nNursing homes provide a distinctly higher level of medical care than other types of senior living, such as independent living, assisted living, and memory care. Nursing homes can also be called “care homes,” “skilled rehab facilities,” or “long-term care facilities.”\n\nElderly nursing home residents often have significant physical or mental health conditions that require long-term, 24-hour nursing and personal care. Seniors who can no longer lift themselves out of bed or who require daily skilled nursing are often ineligible for assisted living or memory care and may need nursing home care.\n\nFinding a nursing home for your loved one may feel overwhelming. You may have many different facilities to choose from, so how do you know which one is right? Start with your family member’s prioritized needs and consider the facility’s medical services and ratings.\n\nUltimately, there’s no substitute for visiting and experiencing a typical day at the nursing home. As you tour different facilities, be sure to ask whether the nursing home you’re visiting is Medicare or Medicaid certified and licensed if you plan on using your benefits to help cover your care costs there. You can also check the facility’s rating on the Medicare website.\n\nUse these resources to discover what to look for when searching for a nursing home and how to find the best nursing homes near you.\n\nNursing homes are more expensive than assisted living or memory care because they require medically trained staff and more supervision. Nursing homes may cost twice as much as assisted living or memory care facilities in your area.\n\nPaying for a nursing home is not always straightforward, and families can use multiple sources to cover nursing home costs. Often, some nursing home care can be covered with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or veterans benefits. Short-term stays in skilled nursing facilities for rehabilitation may be covered by Medicare, while indefinite stays in a nursing home will require some out-of-pocket payment for rent and meals. Learning how to pay for nursing home care now can help you plan for your future needs.\n\nA Place for Mom has the largest network of senior living communities and home care providers in the nation. We enable caregivers to make the best decisions for their loves ones.",

As the largest senior living referral information service in the United States, A Place for Mom has guided thousands of families through the process of finding senior care.  Using its nationwide network of more than 18,000 providers of senior living services, the company helps families find care and housing options that meet their needs and empowers them to make informed decisions. \n\nWorking under the principle of delivering individualized, local, expert guidance to families seeking senior care opportunities, A Place for Mom was launched in the summer of 2000.

Receiving more than 60,000 inquiries from family members per month, A Place for Mom has been named one of the fastest-growing firms in the United States.\n\nOne-on-one, comprehensive guidance is provided by A Place for Mom staff, helping families explore elder care and senior housing choices, including assisted living, nursing homes, retirement communities, memory care, and respite and residential home care. In addition, A Place for Mom works to connect families with facilities serving individuals who have been diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

      "# Post ID 17kp1k8: Warning - A Place For Mom - Vultures who spam you with +140 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/)\nHi I just want to warn others against contacting A Place For Mom. I did so about six months whole I was just looking to gather information about resources in my area. This company immediately began giving my contact info to every assisted living facility in the region, regardless of whether it was a good fit for my parent or not, and my phone has been ringing off the hook with cold calls ever since. A Place For Mom itself also continues to contact me and harass me, and has ignored all the messages I've sent then asking for it to cease. They've also lied to the Better Business Bureau about taking my name off their list on order to resolve the complaint I made against them for the harassment.\n\nMy aunt had a similar experience with them when looking for a place for my grandpa. She still continues to get calls and emails now years later after my grandpa has passed away. \n\nThere are aging consultant services you can pay for who won't do this sort of thing to you.\n\n## Comment ID k794u0n with +31 score by [(too-much-noise, Reddit, 2023-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k794u0n/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nThanks for the warning!

I also called around on my own, but they were very helpful in finding places that actually took insurance vs. totally self-pay.  Half of the places I called on my own didn’t even return my call until days or weeks later, and I needed help ASAP because he needed overnight care.  I was really pleased with the service they provided and haven’t had any issues thereafter, so not convinced that they are in the same category as A Place For Mom.\n\n### Comment ID k7bqjqt with +2 score by [(atxJohnR, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7bqjqt/) (in reply to ID k798z98):\nThey generally charge the place people move into an average of $3500. That $3500 could have been your move in incentive. Nothing is free, and this company is the worst\n\nEdit, APFM Fees range from market to market. The fees are either flat (like $3500), or equivalent to whatever a half, or full month's rent (and care) are for the apartment chosen and care plan monthly rate.\n\n#### Comment ID k7clkhn with +2 score by [(VirginiaUSA1964, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7clkhn/) (in reply to ID k7bqjqt):\nThat's about right.

If you’re on reddit, you probably don’t need them! Mostly for folks who aren’t good at googling or discovering places nearby. It’s a referral service, so APFM gets commission if someone moves in to a place they recommended. We were told to keep calling until the parent moves. Even if you’re years off from needing a place, they will call and call and call.\n\n### Comment ID kpfrlxy with +4 score by [(bonniebelle8, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/kpfrlxy/) (in reply to ID k79jf8q):\nI worked for APFM too.

I ended up using a placement agent recommended by the hospital and he still took us to places where he knew he couldn't get commission but we had no way to say \"but he did the work\".  I thought I was just submitting an initial request for contact to the Web site and they flooded everyone in the area.\n\nIt's a ridiculous system, if they'd given me recommendations and ratings at least there would have been some minor effort.\n\n## Comment ID k7bqd3p with +4 score by [(atxJohnR, Reddit, 2023-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/17kp1k8/warning_a_place_for_mom_vultures_who_spam_you/k7bqd3p/) (in reply to ID 17kp1k8):\nCan confirm.

If they find out where she is then they’ll try to collect from that place. It is not a small commission. It’s thousands of dollars for giving you a couple of phone numbers. Happened to me and my Mom.

I got a recommendation for them when I first got on this board.  They give you limited lists of places then harass you after every visit to see if you're going with them.  The places that use them, usually terribly overpriced, will give them a months rent for referral and not give a break to you.   I told my rep repeatedly I was no longer interested.  I got passed onto another guy who I told my mom recovered, she's home with me, delete my file.  He must have been new because he said he'd keep me inactive and not call to which I said if and when I need to place my mom\nI won't use your service.

They go into the facilities and visit residents regularly so they have first hand knowledge of the communities. They get to know you and your elders and can help match them to a place that is a good fit.

But it was very helpful to have someone who could tell us right away which facilties had openings and whether they would eventually take Medicaid if necessary. We were in such new territory, and I appreciated having someone on the ground who had a sense of what we needed and could give us guidance.\n\nThat's a long-winded way of saying that if you want assistance, I'd advise tapping into local senior advisors.\n\n### Comment ID l36apzv with +9 score by [(tomorrowschild, Reddit, 2024-05-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l36apzv/) (in reply to ID l35sxec):\nThis is what we did and it worked out extremely well.\n\n### Comment ID l37y833 with +2 score by [(er_duh_ummm, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l37y833/) (in reply to ID l35sxec):\nWe did the same tho I think she worked for a bigger company but was local.

I immediately hung up realizing the tech guy had text me his direct phone number and they called me back 7-8 times within an hour. I finally answered and inquired on why they were so relentless and was told that they just want to\nhelp people..  that is overkill and the relentless contact is ruining our reputation.. \n\nI worked in senior living prior to working for a place for mom and the experience in a community setting (skilled nursing and assisted living) makes me have a better understanding of the importance of having a good community that fits someone’s care needs but also their personality. Most of the families I work with do move into the communities I recommend because I put the work in to make sure I am sending them to places they can afford and I know are great places… HOWEVER, most advisors have no prior experience in senior living… most of the new people are sales backgrounds and while my job is technically sales, I don’t like looking at it that way. \n\nHow it works is APFM is paid a referral fee by our community partners. Those communities sign a contract with us and agree to pay a referral fee if a resident we refer moves in, usually the equivalent of one month’s rent. Also, this is how we are free to families. \n\nI’m sorry to hear of all of the negative experiences people have.

Some things I wish I knew about the AL/MC referral system. \n\n- The whole system revolves around referral fees (ie, A Place for Mom is free but they're going to get the community fee you pay or a portion of rent). I talked to a lot of places out of our budget and many folks were like \"Okay. Can I connect you to someone who can help?\". \n- The system so much runs this way that some places you can't even get a hold of without a referral (basically the number listed online will get you no one but A Place for Mom can get you a tour)\n- You loose negotiating power by using referral companies, like if you can connect with a memory care without them you may be able to have your community fee cut in half or even totally dropped. \n- You'll be more likely to get in touch with less corporate feeling, family run places. Some of those I called the number online and got someone pretty quickly.\n- With all this, I'd recommend trying to call some places near you, or trying to drop by, if you can, before dealing with A Place for Mom. I also found a more regional guy who I definitely preferred dealing with to A Place for Mom. APFM know nothing about the places they're recommending beyond cost, and typically know nothing about your area. They still email me to this day, and if my mom ever needs a place I will not be dealing with them again. \n- I hate it so much.

I work for APFM and get community fees waived for my families all the time. I just want my families I work with to find the right fit.. at the end of the day I do have a quota to meet, but I find that I can manage to meet that quota by providing a useful service to the families I work with and help them find a place that fits them well-financially and personality wise.. I definitely hope APFM will take the feedback we get from families and make changes.. we just got a new CEO and she is actually a great person.

I'm not at all saying all the workers at APFM are bad people or even bad at their jobs. I don't however recommend them as a company. I was surprised by how predatory I found the senior care referral industry entirely. First, they hardly saved me time. If it was actually possible to get in touch with communities reasonably easily I'd far prefer to contact them myself. APFM didn't have answers to most of my questions about a place so once I was actually connected with someone I'd still have to have a long conversation asking a bunch of questions. I would lose bargaining power simply for referrers being able to easily reach someone while I as a consumer couldn't. I even said something about trying to get in touch to a place to ask some questions and the woman I was talking to from APFM said \"[it was] because they give us the real numbers\". \n\nMore then one place said they could lower the community fee or not charge it but then saw we were referred for APFM and said they couldn't because of APFM. If you work with APFM and somehow have relationships with the places you're sending folks that's great but I have a hard time believing you could have too close of one since you're dealing with places all over the country. \n\nThe regional guy I worked with was more helpful for us. He had been to several of the places he recommended, he also understood exactly where my mother lives in relation to the places he was suggesting. I'd still recommend folks look on their own if in any position to before using someone. I found referrers were helpful in getting in touch with the more corporate places but family owned places answered their phones generally and returned calls quickly.\n\n## Comment ID l389i31 with +3 score by [(meetmypuka, Reddit, 2024-05-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l389i31/) (in reply to ID 1cn9jcb):\nTerrible terrible terrible!

I very soon thanked them and said I found somewhere and told them to take me off the list.\n\n### Comment ID l3dkypt with +1 score by [(Miss-FritoBaggins, Reddit, 2024-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/l3dkypt/) (in reply to ID l3dj58m):\nI wanted to ask, are you looking for a parent?

They say it's free but they send your information to about 7 places claiming you are private pay and needing to move ASAP. They don't tell you that your first months rest + level of care + community fee to whatever care facility you choose goes directly to them. So if you mom or dad is a high level of care and the first months rent is like 9k it goes to that advisor that swooped in and got your information. They also apparently own all your information and data for 5 years. They are horrible to work with and are vultures. \n\n  \n- current admin at a community.\n\n## Comment ID lk286xm with +2 score by [(innerliftorganizing, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1cn9jcb/experiences_with_a_place_for_mom/lk286xm/) (in reply to ID 1cn9jcb):\nThey are terrible, they will not stop contacting me.

Avoid 'A Place for Mom' at All Costs!**\n\nI cannot stress enough how terrible my experience with 'A Place for Mom' has been. Even after informing them that my mother passed away, they continue to harass me with calls, as do the dozens of facilities they irresponsibly shared my contact information with—information I never authorized them to distribute. This service is an absolute waste of money and time.\n\nTheir promises are nothing but empty words. They assured me they would find a placement under $3,200 per month or refund the intake fee. Not only did they fail to deliver, but the only placement they found would have discontinued my mother's dialysis care within two weeks, effectively ending her life. When they couldn't find anything suitable, they backtracked on their refund promise, claiming that a location two hours away somehow fulfilled their commitment—despite it being completely impractical for us.\n\n'A Place for Mom' does nothing more than provide outdated, generic email lists that you could find yourself through a basic internet search. They have ZERO personal knowledge of the facilities they recommend, and multiple communities told me they were worthless and wished more people knew. You end up doing all the work to vet these places yourself while they continuously bombard you with calls, texts, and emails to squeeze money out of your situation.

Hope to visit and walk the city, particularly the SE, in the nest 1-2 years. \n\nHowever, (because feeling a little defensive) the Northern California Bay Area is not as bad as the news might lead you to believe. Our forecast high today is 63 and highest over the next 10 days is 69. Air qualify at 18 is good.  July memories with kids include taking the ferry home from work, then zipping up their jackets before going for a walk to the playground. They loved summer school in July at UC Berkeley, first at Lawrence Hall of Science and later on campus classes for kids. Season tickets for kids at the San Francisco Symphony with events like Robin Williams narrating Peter and the Wolf. MIL was in a nearby nursing home just one block from a beach walkway, easily pushing her wheelchair. \n\nNow retired, we regularly take the ferry to SF to walk places like Chinatown, Fishermans Wharf etc, or drive to Fort Point and walk the Presidio/GG bridge/Palace of Fine Arts area, or drive to Fort Funston to hike, beach walk and watch the hang gliders because, in spite of the news, 99% of SF is clean and beautiful. Or even closer head to Redwood Regional Park in much maligned Oakland to hike in an absolutely gorgeous redwood forest. Or slightly longer drive to Marin County to hike Point Reyes National Seashore/Mount Tamalpais/Muir Woods areas. \n\nTo get a sense of how good the hiking - and related beauty - is in the Bay Area, there are over 1,000 trails [rated 4.5+ out of 5 on AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/us/california/san-francisco?b_tl_lat=38.12371479010139&b_tl_lng=-122.900391756588&b_br_lat=37.34115558502704&b_br_lng=-121.80564479624533&mobileMap=true&rating_min=4.5) within a 25 mile radius of SF.  \n\nWithin 25 miles the following are part of the National Park Service: San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, Presidio of San Francisco, Fort Point National Historic Site, Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park, Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial (*in recent news*), Point Reyes National Seashore, Fort Funston, Muir Woods National Monument, Alcatraz island, Eugene O'Neil National Historic Site, John Muir National Historic Site (his home in the east bay, not the woods).\n\n#### Comment ID lfekwyq with +1 score by [(Cold-Ad-7144, Reddit, 2024-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandrapids/comments/1eczuml/85_yr_old_mil_done_with_ca_fires_is_considering/lfekwyq/) (in reply to ID lf82gv2):\nI lived in SF for 11 years and also near Lake Tahoe. My MIL is in Chico. They have been dealing with evacuations since last week. The trauma from fires is real. She used to work in the town of Paradise. It burned down in 2018 with most evacuated to Chico. When not directly impacted by fire, Chico is in a valley that regularly fills up with smoke from other fires. Even if my house didn’t burn down, I personally know so many people impacted directly by fires over the last several years. It’s not getting better. It’s getting worse.\n\nI recently visited the Bay Area. Beautiful.

The “counselors” will send your loved ones information to every community they contract with in your general area, they do nothing to actually determine what is best for your loved one, they just want the money for the placement contract. If you are looking for care please check the Nursing Home Compare site on Medicare.gov or speak with the long term care ombudsman in your area. Google is also your friend, read reviews, take tours (most communities are happy to accommodate a virtual tour if needed), talk to others who have had to move their loved one into care, or look for local placement services (they’re smaller and tend to be actually client focused). I know it’s a struggle trying to find the right fit for the right care for your loved one but APFM will actually make your life harder, not easier.\n\n## Comment ID l6pojfp with +2 score by [(Ok-Strawberry-9838, Reddit, 2024-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1d55k9e/friendly_warning_do_not_use_a_place_for_mom/l6pojfp/) (in reply to ID 1d55k9e):\nI agree was not referred anywhere good for my mom.

I am a former senior advisor for a similar company. And we did things very differently. \n\nAPFM will hire any warm body that will work under their pressure.  I remember a time where you had to have experience to be an advisor for APFM. That stopped years ago.\n\n\nI have 16 years in the industry and spent most of that time in the dementia field.\nI truly “advised” and coached my families through the process because the industry is confusing. I was honest and taught them how to do their due diligence when vetting a community. After all, in most cases they were choosing their loved ones last home. Kind of a big deal. If they had an interest in a community we did NOT partner with, I still reached out and collected that info or set a tour there if the family wanted it. I know that isn’t the norm in this business. But I would appreciate it if the show was on the other foot.\n\nSenior living is big business and unfortunately that’s most businesses these days.\n\nAnd one fallacy I saw posted here by another user I want to clear up. APFM isn’t just used by bad communities that need heads in beds. Pretty much all your major senior living players use referral agencies and so do the lesser known communities to capture online business. This is and has been the model for sometime. The only exceptions tend to be CCRC communities and non profit or religious affiliated communities. And even some of them have changed course and started working with placement agencies both online and boots on the ground types.\n\n## Comment ID l7i5v7j with +1 score by [(wherespamgoeslol, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1d55k9e/friendly_warning_do_not_use_a_place_for_mom/l7i5v7j/) (in reply to ID 1d55k9e):\nTried going through them to find a place for my mom had one of the agents schedule an appointment for me to tour a facility and when I got there, the facility said they didn't have a tour scheduled for that day.

Mom would have needed memory care if dad died, but with him as an anchor she did fine in the ALF.  However, with lingering problems from the broken hip and extremely poor compliance with rehab, I don't see her ever getting back to the ALF, which has told me they \"generally won't take anyone that isn't at least 50% weight bearing.\"  I'm doubtful she will ever get back to that, and the ALF director (a very good guy) told me (with all kinds of caveats) that he is skeptical she will be able to come back.  The nursing home is using a slide board, which the ALF theoretically can use, but they seem reluctant to take someone back that may need that for a long time, or forever.  To make matters more complicated, dad categorically refuses to move out of the area, which is now prone to terrible traffic.  It often takes him 45 minutes to the nursing home mom is rehabbing in, so staying there long term is not a solution.  Its also not a great place, especially nights and weekends.  My dad would not meet the requirements to live in a nursing home without insurance fraud, and he'd probably go nuts with her in one of those tiny rooms.  At least in the ALF, he could get some space every now and then.  So the best situation would either be a facility with both a nursing home and an ALF, or two independent facilities very close together.  \n\n**The Need:**  Its sufficiently complicated and I'm sufficiently far away that I'm thinking if there is quality professional help out there, that would be great.  Anyone have positive or negative experiences with the various services?\n\n## Comment ID iuo4kdh with +11 score by [(SandhillCrane5, Reddit, 2022-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/yjbylo/thoughtsrecommendations_for_senior_placement/iuo4kdh/) (in reply to ID yjbylo):\nYou'd be better off hiring a private Geriatric Care Manager to help you find an appropriate place rather than severely limiting your options to facilities that need to pay a service for referrals. The better facilities do not utilize A Place for Mom and similar services. A licensed and certified Geriatric Care Manager is highly qualified and experienced and since you are hiring and paying them, their only goal will be to recommend the best care possible within your guidelines.

I just want to warn as many people as I can about these scammers. It’s been over a year since I first gave them my number and I cannot get rid of them. If you want to find out for yourself, try filling out their form without giving them a phone number, or only giving them a landline number. If you get a message that a cell phone number is required information or not optional - you can be sure someone is attempting to get your number for the purpose of giving it to salesmen. Or selling it to other sites. Try that little test and save yourself a lot of grief.",

Now, it seems like, maybe, they have some partnerships going on and it’s now all about driving revenue.

They called my business line for the HHA agency I own. They were trying to ask a lot of questions, and I service exclusively veterans who are referred to me from the local VA. After some vagueness on their end, I finally asked them what they wanted because I was busy and didn't have time to beat around the bush. They wanted me to pay them to advertise my HHA agency and refer people to me. I told them I wasn't interested, and they tried to kick off on some sales spiel...but I cut then off, said I wasn't interested, and hung up. I haven't heard from them since.\n\n## Comment ID l5ucoof with +2 score by [(stardropunlocked, Reddit, 2024-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1d1ajfi/a_place_for_mom/l5ucoof/) (in reply to ID 1d1ajfi):\nIf I could do one singular thing differently about this whole care journey, I would not give them my information.

They’ve never actually been inside any of the facilities they recommend . They’ll probably continue harassing you long past the time you need the help too.\n\nIt’s better to look up individuals who are senior housing consultants in your area.

I used to work in Assisted Living/Independent living and I am happy to answer any questions you have!\n\nFirst off-most AL facilities are understaffed and overpriced-there is huge turnover (especially the med techs/CNA's) so an important thing to check is staff turnover. Meet with the Director, Nursing supervisor & activity directors-sit in on some of the planned activities they have and take a look at their calendars-do they have a variety of activities for different interests? Also-stop by at lunchtime and try the food!    \nWalk around and talk to the other residents (and their families if possible) and pay attention to the general \"vibe\" of the facility-do the residents smile and talk to each other?  What about the employees-do they seem happy to be there-are they caring towards the residents or do they seem to ignore them? Also ask about emergency evacuation plans-you would be surprised how many AL places don't have a good plan in place in case of fire, etc.\n\nThere are some decent AL facilities in Austin, but most are not very good and tbh I would not want to move my parents into them!  \n\nFeel free to DM me with any questions-I can also refer you to some great people that work in the senior care industry.\n\n### Comment ID la2iuxe with +1 score by [(Entire_Coyote5791, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ap914o/assisted_living_facility_recommendations/la2iuxe/) (in reply to ID kq4r19g):\nHi, I am desperate for help and guidance.

A Place For Mom tends to push you towards the most expensive place. \n\nThere is a form that you can ask for from the senior living facility that will let you compare them side by side. It's the DHHS form 6437 and gives the most important thing to you -- staffing levels. You should compare these staffing levels as the primary driver of what you pay. Pro tip: You'll find that some places are 2x the cost for the same staffing level and maybe slightly nicer wall paint.\n\nAlso, pay attention to what happens if they need a higher level of care. Some places will keep dementia patients that aren't flight risks and some won't.\n\n## Comment ID kq6fhft with +3 score by [(banzai0311, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ap914o/assisted_living_facility_recommendations/kq6fhft/) (in reply to ID 1ap914o):\nA friend of mine has her mother in New Hope Manor (on New Hope) in Cedar Park and her mom loves it there.

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

Hitting 50% sounds easy until you see how many people actually can do that. \n\nOld school/closed minded company - they warn you of this before you start but there’s absolutely no wiggle room; you must work holidays/nights/weekends/end of month. For being called a place for mom, they sure don’t care out their employees or their employees families. It is business first - always! \n\nMicromanagement at all levels - I was an RM &amp; I was micromanaged to micromanage my SLA team. That type of fear leadership doesn't help anyone. I couldn’t even set clear expectations with my team because the expectations changed nearly everyday. The extreme whiplash created a toxic environment for all.",

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

It is business first - always! \n\nMicromanagement at all levels - I was an RM &amp; I was micromanaged to micromanage my SLA team. That type of fear leadership doesn't help anyone.

The Chief Sales Officer's blatant disregard for staff welfare, prioritizing customer satisfaction over employee morale, flies in the face of the company's purported values. Despite the founders' efforts to instill a positive culture, it's evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment. The appalling behavior exhibited by upper management on national calls, resorting to derogatory language and insults towards the team, is utterly unacceptable for any professional setting.While the company boasts about its training programs, the reality falls short, with incomplete and ineffective execution. The President's incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different. From top to bottom, the company is rife with dysfunction, making it unthinkable to recommend their services to anyone. A Place for Mom is a far cry from its advertised image, and I would caution against entrusting the care of loved ones to such an organization.",

        "cons": "It’s very obvious that APFM have been doing damage control on these reviews, my other 2 previous reviews were removed and there is a bunch of fake 5 star reviews on here. \n\nTo be completely transparent, SLA at APFM is a tough role. Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \n\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \n\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \n\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \n\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all. You’re in a group of about 30 people for training initially, every person I was in training with, is no longer with the company. I’ve managed to hang in there but as you can see, I’m looking for other opportunities. It’s probably the most stressful role I’ve ever had as they do threaten job security if you aren’t making quota. \n\nThey also offer a sign on bonus, but if you leave the company for the 1 year make, they’ll make you pay it back. \n\nI would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere.",

      "# [The 7 Stages of Dementia by Leah Hallstrom on 2024-05-28](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-stages)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are seven stages of dementia, each with distinct symptoms. The stages are broken down into three phases of pre-, middle-, and late-stage dementia.\n\nDementia typically isn’t diagnosed until stage 4. Dementia stages 1, 2, and 3 are classified as pre-dementia stages, as symptoms aren’t yet severe enough for a diagnosis.\n\nThere’s no set timeline for how long each stage will last. Understanding the symptoms associated with each stage will help you monitor your loved one as the disease progresses.\n\nMemory care communities can help. Explore how thoughtfully designed memory care communities can support your loved one at any stage.\n\nWhat are the seven stages of dementia?\n\nHealth care providers use a comprehensive tool to assess the seven stages of dementia in the elderly called the Global Deterioration Scale.[01] Also known as the GDS, this trusted method enables caregivers and health professionals to determine how quickly dementia is progressing in an elderly patient. It also helps families and care providers know which symptoms to expect during each of the seven stages of dementia.\n\nLearning about the dementia stages can help caregivers track and monitor stage-related symptoms to identify a loved one’s brain-health status.\n\nThe seven stages of dementia include:\n\nStage 1: no cognitive impairment\n\nStage 2: very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3: mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 4: moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 5: moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6: severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 7: very severe cognitive decline\n\nHow does dementia progress?\n\nThe seven stages are separated into three progressive phases or levels of dementia:\n\nPre-dementia or early-stage dementia (stages 1, 2, and 3). In this initial phase, a person can still live independently and may not exhibit obvious memory loss or have any difficulty completing regular tasks. Mild dementia symptoms mimic episodes of age-related forgetfulness.\n\nModerate or middle-stage dementia (stages 4 and 5). Moderate dementia symptoms significantly affect a person’s personality and behavior. Someone with middle-stage dementia will generally need full- or part-time caregiver assistance with regular day-to-day activities. Moderate-stage dementia symptoms include significant cognitive impairment and mood swings.\n\nSevere or late-stage dementia (stages 6 and 7). These final phases are associated with severe cognitive impairment along with a loss of physical abilities. Late dementia symptoms can include pronounced memory loss, incontinence, and an inability to move without help.\n\nSpecific types of dementias — including Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementia — advance at unique rates and differ from person to person. Therefore, it’s important to understand the signs and symptoms at each stage so you can quickly identify whether your loved one’s dementia has progressed. Read on for a look at the symptoms related to each stage.\n\nDementia stage 1: No cognitive impairment\n\nThough it may sound odd, stage 1 dementia often looks like normal mental functioning without any cognitive decline. Someone in the first three stages of dementia doesn’t usually exhibit enough symptoms to be diagnosed.\n\nWhile mild cognitive impairment may be present, stages 1, 2, and 3 on the GDS are recognized as pre-dementia stages. However, it’s important to note that changes in the brain are still taking place in these early stages, which could eventually lead to a dementia diagnosis at stage 4.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nDementia stage 2: Very mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 2 dementia includes simple memory mistakes like a loved one wondering, “Where did I put my keys?” or “What was that person’s name?” This is a pre-dementia stage and does not yet warrant an official dementia diagnosis.\n\nA significant portion of the senior population experiences age-related forgetfulness, and caregivers or medical providers may not even notice such a mild impairment. This explains why stage 2 is also known as “age-associated memory impairment” on the GDS, meaning many older adults will experience symptoms like these at some point during aging.\n\n“About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age-associated memory impairment — in the United States, about 16 million people,” said Professor Gary W. Small in research published by the British Medical Association.[02] “Only about 1% of them will progress to dementia each year.”\n\nThis means that for many people, pre-dementia stage 2 does not progress to an official dementia diagnosis. Seniors can maintain at this stage for a long time or indefinitely with the right lifestyle changes that support their brain health.\n\nStage 2 dementia symptoms include:\n\nLosing track of familiar objects\n\nInability to recall names of friends, family members, and former acquaintances\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nDementia stage 3: Mild cognitive decline\n\nStage 3 dementia is also known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or decline. It doesn’t generally have a major effect on day-to-day functioning and may not yet result in an official dementia diagnosis. Memory and cognitive problems may become more regular and noticeable to caregivers and family members.\n\nHow quickly can this early dementia stage progress to a dementia diagnosis in the elderly?\n\nAn estimated 10 to 20 percent of people age 65 or older with MCI will develop recognizable or diagnosable dementia within a year, according to the National Institute on Aging.[03]\n\nSince MCI can precede more severe dementia, it’s important to recognize these stage 3 signs, and seek medical advice to support your brain health and keep the dementia from progressing.\n\nStage 3 dementia symptoms include:\n\nOften forgetting to go to appointments or events\n\nLosing things often\n\nGetting lost while traveling\n\nDecreased work performance\n\nDifficulty finding the right words\n\nVerbal repetition\n\nChallenges with organization and concentration\n\nTrouble with complex tasks and problem-solving\n\nProblems with driving\n\nDementia stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline\n\nStage 4 dementia is when a person has clear, visible signs of cognitive impairment and also exhibits personality changes, with significant dementia behaviors and severe stage 3 symptoms. A person is not typically diagnosed with dementia until they’re at stage 4 or beyond.\n\nWhile the medical terminology for stage 4 dementia is moderate cognitive decline, this stage is officially diagnosed by the GDS as “mild dementia.” At this stage, doctors and caregivers will likely observe hallmark signs that dementia is getting worse, including difficulties with language and reduced problem-solving skills.\n\nStage 4 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSocial withdrawal\n\nEmotional moodiness\n\nLack of responsiveness\n\nReduced intellectual sharpness\n\nTrouble with routine tasks\n\nForgetting recent events\n\nDenial of symptoms\n\nDementia stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline\n\nThis stage marks the onset of what many professionals refer to as middle-stage dementia or “mid-stage” in the seven stages of dementia. At this point, a person may no longer be able to carry out normal activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing or bathing, or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) without some caregiver assistance.\n\nStage 5 often lasts between two and four years, though every dementia patient will progress at a unique rate.[04]\n\nIn stage 5 dementia, your loved one will likely require more intense support and supervision. They know major facts about themselves — such as their name and their children’s names — but they may not remember their grandchildren’s names, their longtime address, or where they went to high school.\n\nStage 5 dementia symptoms include:\n\nPronounced memory loss, including personal details and current events\n\nWandering\n\nConfusion and forgetfulness\n\nDisorientation and sundown syndrome\n\nFurther reduced mental acuity and problem-solving ability\n\nDementia stage 6: Severe cognitive decline\n\nStage 6 dementia marks a need for caregiver help to perform basic daily activities, such as eating, using the toilet, and other self-care. Seniors experiencing this stage of moderately severe dementia may have difficulty regulating sleep, interacting with others, or behaving appropriately in public settings.\n\nAt stage 6 of dementia, you may find yourself wondering if full-time care is necessary as symptoms become more complex. You can stay prepared by tracking symptoms, monitoring your loved one’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and exploring care options like memory care or home care.\n\nStage 6 dementia symptoms include:\n\nSleep difficulties\n\nUrinary or fecal incontinence\n\nAggression and anxiety\n\nPersonality changes including paranoia or delusions\n\nInability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)\n\nPronounced memory loss\n\nInability to recognize loved ones and caregivers\n\nDementia stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline\n\nIn stage 7, which is considered end-stage dementia, people can no longer care for themselves and are barely responsive as their verbal and physical capacities shut down. All verbal ability is lost, movement becomes severely impaired, and bodily organs begin to fail.\n\nStage 7 dementia symptoms include:\n\nInability to speak\n\nInability to remember loved ones or caregivers\n\nLack of physical ability to move without help\n\nInability to chew or swallow\n\nImpaired bodily functions, including breathing, and organ failure\n\nSleeping a lot\n\nUrinary and fecal incontinence\n\nHow long does this aggressive end stage of dementia last?\n\nThe final stage of dementia can typically last one to three years, but it’s difficult to predict since everyone is different.[05]\n\nHow fast does dementia progress?\n\nThere’s no way to predict how long it will take for a loved one to progress through all the stages of dementia. Lifestyle factors can make a big difference in how fast dementia will progress, like diet and exercise.\n\nDementia gets worse with time, but some people stay in the early stages of dementia longer and can remain independent for many years. Others may experience rapid dementia progression and will require more immediate support. Once a person reaches the final, most aggressive stage of dementia, they typically only have a couple years left.[05]\n\nHow long do people live with dementia?\n\nHow to care for a loved one with dementia\n\nCaregivers have a variety of ways to provide support to a loved one through the progression of dementia:\n\nTry to have positive and meaningful conversations using effective dementia communication strategies.\n\nConsider exploring unique dementia treatment options and therapies.\n\nCreate a dementia care plan.\n\nConsider joining a support group for caregivers.\n\nLearn about dementia care techniques for caregivers.\n\nFind memory care options in your area.\n\nComing to accept a loved one’s dementia diagnosis, and understanding what to expect, can help you feel empowered and provide opportunities to make the most of this time together.\n\nIf the idea of navigating a dementia diagnosis alone seems overwhelming, A Place for Mom is here for you. Explore our library of caregiver resources, which contains hundreds of articles covering dementia therapies and information on memory care communities.\n\nMemory care options\n\nMemory care is specialized support for seniors with a dementia diagnosis. These communities provide 24-hour supervision by trained memory care caregivers to reduce anxiety, assist with ADLs, and prevent accidents caused by wandering.\n\nMemory care communities also provide comfortable and thoughtfully designed living arrangements, meal services, and trained on-site nurses ready administer health care as needed. Therapeutic on-site memory care activities, dining plans, and exercise programs (for both mind and body) address all types of dementia symptoms. Whether through in-home care or at a community, specialized memory care can be beneficial from the early stages of dementia through the end of life.\n\nUnderstanding when to seek memory care will vary depending on a senior’s dementia symptoms, health status, living situation, and more. Our Senior Living Advisors offer free guidance and are ready to discuss local memory care communities or dementia home care options with your family, tailored to your budget and individualized needs.",
      "# [20 Nutritious and Easy Recipes for Senior Nutrition by Claire Samuels on 2024-04-30](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/easy-recipes-for-senior-nutrition)\nKey Takeaways\n\nSeniors often lose interest in cooking. Medication side effects, changing taste buds, physical difficulty, and eating alone are all reasons older adults may not cook.\n\nMany stores offer pre-cut vegetables and canned ingredients, which reduces prep time. Tasty veggie recipes include stir-fry, stuffed sweet potatoes, and garlicky roasted eggplant.\n\nCooking with grandchildren can make it more enjoyable. Pizza dough, homemade ice cream, and vegetable nachos can be fun, easy, and memorable recipes for the grandkids.\n\nMany seniors don't drink enough water. To combat dehydration and improve health, seniors can infuse water with fruits and herbs.\n\nPreparing and planning easy meals for seniors\n\nWe’ve compiled 20 delicious and easy meal ideas for seniors that combine fresh produce with pantry staples for fulfilling dinners, side dishes, and drinks. The best part? Each easy recipe requires minimal prep, has seven or fewer steps, and is on the table in under an hour.\n\nMeal planning can be even easier now, as many grocery stores make cooking more accessible by offering fresh, pre-cut fruits and vegetables. This reduces prep time as well as physical strain for older adults with arthritis or another health condition that makes chopping difficult. But frozen fruits and veggies are also great to keep on hand — you don’t have to worry about upcoming expiration dates, and they can help you pull a nutritious meal together quickly.\n\nAn unhealthy diet can lead to a range of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).[01] Incorporate some of the following recipes for elderly parents to help you or an aging loved one combat illnesses and maintain a well-balanced diet.\n\nRead more:10 Health Tips for Seniors\n\nVeggies shine in these easy recipes for seniors\n\nA rainbow of fresh, in-season fruits and vegetables add vitamins and minerals to your diet. If you have a farmers market near you, stock up on locally grown favorites. If you don’t, your grocery store should offer delicious produce all year. Adults should aim to eat at least 14 ounces (or 1 1/2 cups) of fruits and veggies each day, according to WHO.\n\n1. One-pan salmon and vegetables\n\nThis recipe is so easy, it’s almost not even a recipe. It showcases flaky and rich pink salmon, a low-calorie protein source full of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and energy-boosting B vitamins.[02]\n\nThis non-recipe is versatile! Replace salmon with another flaky fish like tilapia or trout. Swap out the veggies for whatever’s in your fridge, or add potatoes for a heartier meal.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 squash or zucchini, sliced into rounds\n\n½ onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 cup cherry or grape tomatoes\n\n1 bell pepper, sliced\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\n1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning or your favorite fish-seasoning blend\n\n2-3 salmon fillets, about 4 ounces each\n\n1 lemon, optional\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 450 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil (not wax paper). If you don’t have these, you can thoroughly grease the pan with vegetable oil.\n\nIn a large bowl, toss all veggies with 2 tablespoons of oil and seasoning, then spread them into a single layer on the baking sheet.\n\nNestle your salmon fillets, skin side down, between the vegetables. Brush with remaining olive oil and top with 2 thin lemon slices each.\n\nRoast for 12-15 minutes until salmon is flaky and mostly opaque.\n\nAdd 1 salmon fillet and a heaping serving of roasted veggies to each plate for a healthy and satisfying meal. Enjoy!\n\n2. Tasty tomato tart\n\nThis easy weeknight dinner is packed with lycopene and vitamin C to boost vision health and add to senior nutrition.[02] It’s similar enough to pizza that even picky eaters will try it — but it’s a total showstopper with fresh, colorful ingredients.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed\n\n1 onion, thinly sliced\n\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n2-3 large tomatoes (multiple colors make a beautiful tart, but red works just as well)\n\n1 cup of your favorite cheese (such as blue cheese, mozzarella, feta, or Parmesan)\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, or chopped fresh herbs like basil and oregano\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nStretch out the puff pastry on the lined baking sheet. With a fork, poke small holes along the bottom.\n\nAdd onions and olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Sauté, stirring frequently, until soft — about 5 minutes.\n\nSprinkle cooked onions over the pastry dough, then top with tomato slices so they don’t overlap. Sprinkle with cheese and half of your seasoning or herbs. Season with salt (or salt replacement, if you’re avoiding sodium) and pepper to your tastes.\n\nBake for 25 minutes until the crust is golden. Sprinkle with the remaining herbs, cut into squares, and enjoy!\n\n3. Roasted root vegetables\n\nRoot vegetables — like sweet potatoes, beets, parsnips, and carrots — are vibrant and versatile. They’re high in fiber and antioxidants, and some have been proven to stabilize blood sugar as a successful part of a diabetic diet.[02] They’re also a tasty replacement for classic roasted potatoes — and just as easy to make.\n\nThis recipe involves chopping firm vegetables, which may be difficult for some seniors. To get the benefits of root vegetables without as much knife work, check out the recipe for Stuffed Southwest Sweet Potatoes below.\n\nIngredients\n\n½ red onion, cut into wedges\n\n1 large sweet potato, peeled\n\n2 large carrots, peeled\n\n1 large beet, scrubbed and trimmed\n\nSeveral new potatoes, skin on, cut in halves or quarters\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n4 teaspoons mixed dried herbs, like rosemary, oregano, and parsley\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 400 F and grease a large baking sheet.\n\nCut root vegetables into even-sized pieces, about an inch each.\n\nToss root vegetables with olive oil, herbs, salt, and pepper. Spread in an evenly spaced layer on the prepared pan.\n\nBake for 30-40 minutes, stirring and flipping vegetables twice or until soft.\n\n4. Berry chicken salad\n\nFor a colorful and protein-packed lunch, this easy recipe for seniors repurposes leftover shredded or chopped chicken into a salad that replaces classic grapes with fresh, antioxidant-rich berries.\n\nIngredients\n\n¼ cup olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 teaspoon sugar\n\n½ teaspoon dried tarragon\n\n1½ cups chopped or shredded leftover chicken (about 1 breast)\n\n1 cup quartered fresh strawberries or whole fresh blueberries\n\n½ cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed\n\n¼ cup chopped celery\n\nTorn salad greens or spinach\n\nInstructions\n\nWhisk the first three ingredients together in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdd chicken, berries, peas, and celery, and stir well to combine.\n\nScoop chicken salad over salad greens or spinach for a fresh and filling lunch.\n\nRecipe adapted from Taste of Home\n\n5. Vegetable stir-fry\n\nThis quick take on everyone’s favorite carryout dish can be adapted to whatever ingredients you have on hand and made in one pan for easy cleanup.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil or non-hydrogenated vegetable oil\n\n½ pound protein, such as cubed chicken breast, sliced steak, or tofu\n\n2 cups mixed vegetables (such as peppers, zucchini, broccoli, onions, snap peas, and mushrooms)\n\nFor the sauce\n\n¼ cup orange juice\n\n¼ cup water\n\n2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce\n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\n1 teaspoon fresh ginger or a sprinkling of ginger powder\n\nInstructions\n\nHeat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook the protein, stirring regularly, until lightly browned and cooked through. Add vegetables and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until soft. Remove meat and veggies from the pan and set aside.\n\nMix all sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Add the mixture to your pan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until slightly thickened.\n\nAdd vegetables and protein back to the pan and stir to combine.\n\nServe over brown rice or noodles for a filling meal.\n\n6. Garlicky roasted eggplant with creamy yogurt sauce\n\nEggplant is the star of this easy meal idea for seniors and is a great source of senior nutrition that boasts phytonutrients — a memory booster — and fiber for digestive health.[02] It’s also a soft food that’s easy on dentures without being mushy.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch slices\n\n2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (use pre-chopped from the jar if easier)\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon Mediterranean spice blend or your favorite blend\n\nInstructions\n\nPlace eggplant slices on a baking sheet and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a couple minutes while your oven preheats to 400 F (this softens them and reduces bitterness).\n\nMix garlic, olive oil, and spice blend in a small bowl.\n\nBrush both sides of eggplant with the olive oil mixture for a dose of heart-healthy fats.\n\nRoast eggplant for about 30 minutes, until caramelized, flipping once about halfway through.\n\nFor the Creamy Yogurt Sauce\n\n1 cup Greek yogurt (a great source of probiotics for digestive health)\n\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1 teaspoon honey\n\n1 tablespoon fresh herbs, like basil or mint (optional)\n\nMix all ingredients in a small bowl; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve your roasted eggplant with the yogurt sauce for a fresh, Mediterranean dish. Consider brown rice, whole-grain pasta, or chopped cucumbers and tomatoes as a side dish.\n\n7. “Anything goes” quiche\n\nQuiche has been a popular brunch food for decades and was seen as a luxury for many seniors growing up. This is a fairly inexpensive, easy meal idea for elderly adults that includes leafy greens rich in magnesium, iron, manganese, and vitamins A, C, and K.[02] Make this tasty treat for breakfast and enjoy leftovers throughout the week.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 refrigerated pie crust\n\n5 eggs\n\n1 cup half-and-half\n\n½ teaspoon seasoning of your choice, such as mustard, dill, or rosemary\n\n¾ cup crispy bacon, crumbled cooked sausage, or leftover ham, chopped\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or Swiss cheese\n\n1 cup spinach or kale, torn or chopped\n\n½ cup of your favorite veggie, diced (tomato, broccoli, asparagus, and peppers are good options)\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and roll pie crust into your pie plate.\n\nWhisk eggs, half-and-half, and seasoning in a medium bowl.\n\nSprinkle meat, cheese, and veggies onto the prepared pie crust evenly. Pour the egg mixture to cover.\n\nBake for 40-50 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes before slicing and enjoying.\n\nRecipe adapted from Pillsbury, with vegetables added\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nEasy pantry staple meal ideas for elderly adults\n\nAll of these easy-to-cook recipes for seniors are a nutritious rewrite of a traditional classic. Plus, they all use at least three pantry or freezer staples to minimize shopping and stay budget-friendly. While carbohydrates are often talked about in a negative light, they’re actually part of a healthy diet and help aging adults find energy to fuel their daily activities, according to WHO.[01]\n\n8. Healthy-ish tuna veggie casserole\n\nThis no-fuss take on the classic is perfect for a rainy afternoon when you’re in the mood for something hearty but nutritious. The pasta provides whole grains, while the tuna offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, which are both great for senior nutrition.[02] Broccoli and peas are also rich sources of nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nNote: If arthritis makes opening cans difficult, invest in an electric can opener — it’s a great kitchen tool!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (12-ounce) bag whole-wheat egg noodles\n\n2 (5-ounce) cans tuna, drained\n\n2 (10 ¾-ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup\n\n2 cups frozen veggies, like peas, broccoli, carrots, or a combination\n\n½ cup milk\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n\n8 buttery crackers, like Ritz\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease a 3-quart casserole dish or 13-by-9-inch pan.\n\nCook whole-wheat noodles according to package directions; drain thoroughly.\n\nMix the warm cooked noodles with tuna, soup, veggies, milk, and cheese. Season with salt and pepper as desired (you can add some red pepper flakes for a kick). Spoon into your prepared pan.\n\nCrush up your crackers into small chunks and spread over the top. Feel free to add some more shredded cheese!\n\nBake for 20 minutes until golden, bubbly, and beginning to brown. Serve warm.\n\nRecipe adapted from The Spruce Eats\n\n9. Southwest stuffed sweet potatoes\n\nSweet potatoes are a powerhouse of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals — and they keep as pantry staples for nearly a month.[02] They also may improve your immune system with high levels of vitamin A.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 large sweet potatoes, washed and dried\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 (12 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained*\n\n1 (10 ounce) can diced tomato pepper mix, drained\n\n1 cup shredded cheddar or pepper jack\n\n*For a soft food substitute, use refried black beans.\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.\n\nCut potatoes in half lengthwise, then brush with olive oil and salt.\n\nBake potatoes (cut side down) for 30 minutes or until cooked through.\n\nRemove from oven, allow to cool slightly, and mash up potato flesh with a fork.\n\nSprinkle potatoes with beans, tomato pepper mix, and cheese so the toppings are evenly divided.\n\nReturn to the oven for 5 minutes until cheese is melted.\n\n10. Chickpea tuna salad\n\nHigh-protein chickpeas are a good source of magnesium and potassium, which may reduce blood pressure.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium chickpeas, rinsed and drained\n\n1 (5-ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked\n\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil mayonnaise (regular mayo works just fine but is higher in cholesterol)\n\n1 cup halved cherry tomatoes\n\n½ cup green or black olives, or 2 tablespoons capers (optional)\n\nSpinach or torn salad greens\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd the chickpeas, tuna, mustard, mayonnaise, and cherry tomatoes to a bowl and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to your liking. Add olives or capers, if using.\n\nLay a bed of spinach or greens on a plate and top with salad mixture for an easy dinner. Alternatively, eat the salad between two slices of whole-grain bread like a tuna salad sandwich.\n\n11. Simple soup\n\nThis is a go-to healthy recipe for seniors because it’s open to substitutions and relies on nutrient-dense pantry staples. It’s also a soft food that works for seniors who have trouble chewing or other dental problems.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pound ground beef, Italian sausage, or turkey\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n1 (32-ounce) box low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 (15 ounce) can cannellini or white beans\n\n1 (10 ounce) can crushed or diced tomatoes\n\n1 cup frozen or canned spinach or collard greens (use fresh if you’ve got them on hand)\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\nInstructions\n\nAdd meat to a large soup pot over medium heat. Break apart and stir until browned. Add onion and continue to cook, about 5 minutes, until soft.\n\nIf a fair amount of fat has collected at the bottom of your pan, pour the meat mixture onto paper towels to drain. This may not be necessary for ground turkey or lean beef.\n\nReturn meat and onions to the pot and add remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes until the flavors have melded. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nServe alongside crusty whole-grain bread for a filling meal, or, for a heartier meal, add cooked pasta before serving.\n\nTip: If you’re cooking for someone who prefers softer food, a good trick for soups or stews is to blend half and add it back into the pot for a smoother texture. If blending part of the soup, use caution. The liquid will be hot, and, if not handled with care, blenders can splatter the liquid, creating a burn risk. Make sure to keep a hand on the blender lid while blending to reduce the risk of it coming off.\n\n12. Four bean salad\n\nThis easy recipe is a classic for a reason! The dressing is tangy and sweet, and beans provide proteins and B vitamins.[02] We switched out traditional vegetable oil in favor of olive oil for a more heart-healthy fat.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (15-ounce) can wax beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can green beans\n\n1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\n1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n1 white or yellow onion, thinly sliced\n\n⅔ cup white or apple cider vinegar\n\n½ cup white sugar or ¼ cup honey\n\n⅓ cup olive oil\n\nInstructions\n\nMix all ingredients together in a large bowl or Tupperware container. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nRefrigerate overnight, or at least for several hours, to marinate. Enjoy as a side for grilled chicken or as a topping for green salad.\n\n13. Italian stuffed peppers\n\nBell peppers are a low-calorie, high-flavor vegetable containing folate, fiber, and iron, making them a great source for senior nutrition.[02] They’re also a good base for a variety of fillings and sauces. This versatile, easy recipe could even be made as Mexican stuffed peppers with salsa and taco seasoning.\n\nIngredients\n\n4-6 bell peppers (red, green, yellow, and orange all work)\n\n1 pound ground Italian sausage or ground beef\n\n1 cup cooked quinoa, wild rice, or whole grain of your choice\n\n1 (15-ounce) jar or can tomato sauce\n\n1 cup frozen spinach\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n\n½ cup shredded low-fat mozzarella\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350 F and grease an 8-inch glass baking dish or casserole.\n\nCut the tops from peppers, scoop out seeds, and rinse.\n\nIn a medium skillet, cook beef or sausage about 10 minutes, or until browned. Remove from heat and drain the meat, then return to pan.\n\nStir grains, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, spinach, and seasonings into the cooked meat.\n\nNestle peppers, standing up, into the baking dish. Stuff them with the meat, grain, and spinach mixture until full.\n\nPour remaining tomato sauce over the peppers and top with shredded mozzarella. Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.\n\nBake 20 minutes covered. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and bake about 10 minutes longer until cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n14. Creamy pasta and peas\n\nBright green peas — a low-fat legume naturally high in protein and fiber — and fresh lemon are flavorful ingredients that give easy recipes a pop of color and flavor. This dish also offers plenty of onion (full of antioxidants) and olive oil, a heart-healthy, vegetable-based fat.[02]\n\nIngredients\n\n1 zucchini or summer squash, cut into thin rounds\n\n1 small onion, diced\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus some for serving\n\n½ pound short pasta, like shells or penne\n\n1 pound bag frozen peas\n\n½ cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nLemon juice to taste\n\nFresh basil, if desired\n\nInstructions\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil on the stove.\n\nWhile the water heats up, sauté zucchini or squash, onion, and olive oil over medium heat in a separate pan.\n\nCook pasta according to package directions, adding your frozen peas to the boiling water with 5 minutes remaining.\n\nRemove 1 cup of starchy pasta water from the pot and set aside. Drain pasta and peas and return to the pot, along with onion, olive oil, and veggies.\n\nWhile the mixture is hot, add Parmesan and stir. Slowly, begin to add the starchy water to the mixture. This is where the magic happens! The Parmesan and pasta water will emulsify to make a creamy, restaurant-style sauce — no heavy cream involved.\n\nSprinkle with lemon juice, salt and pepper, and a light drizzle of olive oil to serve. Add basil, if desired.\n\nFamily recipes for senior fun with grandchildren\n\nCooking is a fun way to bond with grandchildren while passing along important life skills. These recipes are not only simple, creative, and tasty, but they’re easy recipes for seniors and families.\n\n15. Easy-peasy pizza dough\n\nWith few ingredients and no rise time, this family recipe is simple. Encourage grandkids to roll the dough into silly shapes, make breadsticks that look like their initials, and enjoy playing — it’s great for little hands. You can be creative with toppings, too!\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (2 ¼ teaspoon) packet yeast\n\n1 cup warm water\n\n1 tablespoon sugar or honey\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (you can replace half with whole wheat)\n\nYour favorite sauce, toppings, and cheese\n\nInstructions\n\nSprinkle yeast over warm water and honey in a large bowl. Wait about 10 minutes until the yeast is bubbly and frothy.\n\nAdd olive oil and salt and stir. Add flour, a bit at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon or silicon spatula until a slightly sticky ball of dough forms.\n\nTransfer to a clean, floured surface and knead, adding dusting flour until no longer sticky.\n\nSeparate the dough into two smaller pizzas and shape as desired (rather than a basic circle, try Mickey Mouse or a heart). Transfer the dough to greased baking sheets or pizza stones, and prick holes in the dough with a fork to avoid bubbles.\n\nTop with your favorite sauce, cheese, vegetables, and meats.\n\nBake 15-20 minutes at 450 F until golden brown.\n\nRecipe adapted from Joy Food Sunshine\n\n16. Three-ingredient homemade ice cream\n\nOK, this recipe is not a healthy option, but it’s fun, super easy, and totally customizable to fit your tastes.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 cups heavy cream\n\n1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\nA mix-in of your choice, like chocolate syrup, crushed Oreos, finely chopped strawberries, sprinkles, etc.\n\nInstructions\n\nIn a large bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks form. You can use an electric beater to make this process easier.\n\nAdd chilled and sweetened condensed milk and vanilla; stir slowly until just combined.\n\nStir in mix-ins of your choice. Get creative! You can separate your base into multiple containers to try more flavors.\n\nSeal into Tupperware containers with lids, and freeze at least 4 hours before enjoying.\n\nRecipe adapted from Bigger Bolder Baking\n\n17. Healthy vegetable nachos\n\nFried tortilla chips smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream are delicious, but a few replacements can turn this favorite into a heart-healthy snack packed with protein from black beans, good fats from avocados, and plenty of flavor from your favorite salsa.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 pile of store-bought baked vegetable chips (if you have time and want to make your own, try this recipe for tasty zucchini chips)\n\n½ cup low-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed, slightly smashed or whole\n\n¼ cup of your favorite mild salsa\n\n½ cup shredded low-fat cheddar or pepper jack cheese\n\n½ cup lettuce, chopped\n\n¼ cup plain Greek yogurt (a tangy, lower-calorie replacement for sour cream)\n\n1 avocado, sliced, or guacamole (optional)\n\nInstructions\n\nSet oven broiler to low and adjust rack to top position.\n\nCover a rimmed baking sheet with a layer or two of veggie chips. Sprinkle beans, salsa, and cheese over chips.\n\nBroil in the oven until cheese has melted and beans and salsa are warm (about 5 minutes).\n\nRemove from oven, allow pan to cool, and top with lettuce, Greek yogurt, and avocado.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nPrevent dehydration in seniors with delicious infusions\n\nRead more:How to Improve Immune System in Elderly: 10 Key Ways\n\nSenior living for seniors who don’t enjoy cooking\n\nIf it’s becoming too difficult or tiresome for an aging loved one to cook and maintain a well-balanced diet, it may be time to consider senior living options.\n\nFor self-sufficient adults who want a break from daily chores like cooking and cleaning, independent living is a great choice. However, if a senior is starting to need more help with activities of daily living, like walking and eating, then they may benefit from assisted living.\n\nBoth independent living and assisted living offer senior residents delicious and nutritious meal plans, often created with the help of registered nurses, nutritionists, and/or dieticians. Furthermore, most communities accommodate special diets and restrictions. For instance, around 62% of both independent and assisted living communities offer vegan and/or vegetarian meals within A Place for Mom’s network.[05]\n\nIf exceptional dining is particularly important, you can contact a Senior Living Advisor for more information.

      "# [19 Engaging Activities for People With Dementia at Home by Amanda Lundberg, RN, family medicine expert on 2024-07-31](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/dementia-activities)\nKey Takeaways\n\nCreative activities keep seniors engaged and allow for emotional expression.\n\nReminiscing activities provide cues to recall cherished memories.\n\nSeniors can enjoy feelings of accomplishment and self-worth through simple tasks like folding laundry and solving puzzles.\n\nTailor activities to your loved one’s abilities to reduce frustration and anxiety.\n\nArts and crafts activities for seniors with dementia\n\nOne way to keep dementia patients engaged is to delve into their past interests or talents. Niki Gewirtz, a Senior Living Advisor at A Place for Mom and former executive director of a memory care community, recommends gaining a deep understanding of your loved one’s hobbies and strengths so that you can tailor activities to their interests and abilities.\n\nExplore the following activities that can stir up a loved one’s former passions and strengths.\n\n1. Paint or draw\n\nPainting and drawing are ways to express feelings safely and with creativity. Encourage using bold, bright colors on big surfaces. Rolls of butcher paper enable seniors with dementia to create without encountering the stress of defined spaces. These activities for the elderly with dementia are not only fun but also can be therapeutic, as they promote emotional expression.\n\n2. Do a craft\n\nActivities involving different textures, such as playing with clay, offer tactile stimulation for dementia patients. Crafting with these materials or even exploring different shapes and sizes can be beneficial and enjoyable.\n\n3. Create collages\n\nCut out images from magazines, or print old ads and articles. Choose subjects that fit your loved one’s interests, like cooking, cars, or fashion. Another idea is to scan and print old family pictures. Let your family member with dementia arrange and rearrange the elements to create pictures or scrapbook pages.\n\nReminiscence activities for dementia patients at home\n\nEngaging in reminiscence therapy activities is a delightful way to help your loved ones recall cherished memories and exercise their cognitive abilities. These dementia activities utilize sensory and visual cues to gently guide seniors through their past, making them both meaningful and comforting.\n\n4. Watch classic movies and TV shows\n\nKeep dementia patients engaged by arranging nostalgic movie nights. Whether they were fans of westerns like Gunsmoke or adored musicals like The King and I, watching these old favorites can provide both entertainment and memory stimulation.\n\n5. Listen to music and sing\n\n“Music can awaken the brain, and with it, the rich trove of memories that are associated with familiar songs,” according to the nonprofit group Music and Memory. Stream classics or sing memorable songs like holiday carols. Sing-alongs and music classes were more common in mid-century schools; you might be surprised at how many songs your loved one remembers from childhood.\n\n6. Look through photo albums\n\nOne of the most heartwarming activities for dementia seniors involves revisiting old photo albums. These albums, filled with images from their younger years, can help to reignite treasured memories. You could also digitize these pictures and create virtual memory books to make this more interactive.\n\n7. Flip through magazines and catalogs\n\nBefore the era of modern shopping, catalogs and magazines played a significant role in staying informed about trends. Finding copies or reprints of magazines they once enjoyed, such as Life or Cosmopolitan, or even the Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog, can be one of the most engaging things for dementia patients to do.\n\nRead more: Music Therapy for Dementia\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nFulfilling activities for people with dementia at home\n\nFulfilling activities can significantly contribute to a senior’s quality of life, fostering feelings of achievement and self-worth. These dementia activities should be tailored to the senior’s cognitive level, ensuring they feel engaged and productive without being overwhelmed.\n\n8. Fold laundry\n\nThis routine task is one of the most calming activities for seniors with dementia. The familiar process of folding soft fabrics and the scent of classic detergents can evoke comforting memories. Start with uncomplicated items like hand towels and T-shirts for this simple yet fulfilling task.\n\n9. Enjoy hands-on activities\n\nFor people who enjoyed do-it-yourself projects, suggest activities that yield visible results. Painting wooden boards or assembling PVC pipes are ideal things for dementia patients to do, particularly for seniors with good motor function. For people with more advanced dementia, wooden or plastic play tools can offer a similar sense of achievement.\n\n10. Untie knots\n\nThis is one of the tactile activities for dementia patients that can keep them engaged. Tie loose knots along a durable, comfortable rope. The act of untying can provide both cognitive and physical stimulation without causing frustration or discomfort.\n\n11. Do a puzzle\n\nPuzzles for seniors with dementia, such as large-piece, color, or shape puzzles with tactile pieces, can be both entertaining and cognitively beneficial.\n\n12. Play a game\n\nBoard games like Guess Who? and Battleship are ideal because they stimulate memory and cognitive skills in a fun and engaging way while being straightforward enough not to cause confusion or frustration. Guess Who? can help with facial recognition and memory, while Battleship encourages strategic thinking. Even more playful options like a remote-controlled pet can bring immense joy and engagement. These toys can stimulate a sense of caring and provide amusement as your loved one controls the pet’s movements.\n\nRead more: 5 Best Puzzles for Dementia Patients\n\nSensory activities for seniors with dementia\n\nThe following dementia activities can stimulate the senses and evoke fond memories, leading to a more fulfilled and engaged life for your loved one.\n\n13. Stop and smell the roses\n\nScents can trigger stronger emotional memories than visuals, as they’re processed in the brain’s memory control areas. Surrounding your loved one with familiar smells, like fresh-cut grass or the aroma of warm bread, could evoke joyful memories and emotions. It’s crucial to avoid smells that could cause distress, like diesel fuel or gunpowder, which can be triggers for older veterans.\n\n14. Touch old, familiar objects\n\nEngaging in tactile activities for dementia patients can stimulate reminiscence. Even if they can’t recall specific events, touching familiar objects, like keys or hand-embroidered beads, can trigger memories.\n\n15. Taste favorite foods\n\nLike smells, tastes can elicit emotions and memories. Your mom’s famous chocolate cake could bring back birthdays; a sip of instant coffee could recall quiet, early mornings at home.\n\n16. Feel diverse textures\n\nExperiencing different textures can be a fulfilling dementia activity that provides sensory stimulation and memory cues. Consider things that align with their interests: soft animal fur for pet lovers or damp soil and leaves for seniors who enjoyed gardening. Create an activity around this by making a bag of varied textures to be sorted by touch.\n\nTechnology-based dementia activities for seniors\n\nTechnology can offer stimulating, engaging, and mentally nourishing experiences for seniors with dementia. Here are some innovative ways technology can facilitate dementia activities and keep seniors living with dementia engaged at home.\n\n17. Discover nature and art through live cams\n\nA wealth of global attractions, from zoos and nature preserves to museums, offer live internet streams. Whether your loved one has a fondness for animals or an appreciation for art, they can experience ever-changing visual stimulation without leaving the comfort of home.\n\n18. Venture globally with Google Earth\n\nGoogle Earth offers a virtual exploration experience like no other through user-uploaded photos. Whether your loved one cherishes memories of their childhood hometown or dreams of the Sahara Desert, Google Earth can offer them a gateway to explore these places.\n\n19. Create a family video tablet for dementia patients at home\n\nVideo calls and chats can keep families connected, and technology can offer comfort even when a conversation isn’t possible. Creating a collection of videos featuring family members, beloved pets, and memorable moments on a tablet can be an ideal activity for dementia patients at home. This personalized tablet can provide solace during restless times or assist with sleep. If a tablet is too complex, consider transferring these precious videos onto a classic videotape or DVD.\n\nThis guide has explored a variety of engaging activities that were designed to enhance cognitive health and emotional comfort for seniors — from revisiting past interests and delving into creative expressions, to reminiscing about cherished memories and fulfilling everyday tasks.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nTips for planning activities for seniors with dementia\n\nWhen choosing activities for seniors with dementia, it’s important to consider their current cognitive abilities, their interests, and the stage of their dementia. Activities should ideally be simple, enjoyable, and familiar to reduce frustration and anxiety.\n\nActivities for mild (early-stage) dementia\n\nIn the early stages, individuals retain much of their independence and their cognitive abilities, though they may have trouble remembering recent events or managing complex tasks.\n\nGood activities for this stage might include:\n\nReading books\n\nSolving a crossword or other puzzles\n\nGardening\n\nCooking or baking\n\nAttending social events\n\nActivities can also include learning new, simple skills, as this stage of dementia is often marked by a desire to continue personal growth and development.\n\nActivities for moderate (middle-stage) dementia\n\nAs dementia progresses into the middle stage, individuals may begin to have difficulty recognizing familiar people and places, and they may struggle with tasks that require multiple steps.\n\nActivities should be simplified and broken down into single steps during this stage. Simple tasks, creative arts, and craft activities like these may be suitable:\n\nPainting or making a scrapbook\n\nSinging old songs or listening to their favorite artists\n\nGoing on short walks\n\nDoing simple chores\n\nAssisted cooking\n\nActivities for severe (late-stage) dementia\n\nIn the late stages of dementia, individuals often have significant memory loss and may have difficulty communicating or recognizing loved ones. However, they can still benefit from sensory and emotional experiences.\n\nSimple tactile activities like the following can be comforting and soothing for individuals with late-stage dementia:\n\nHandling a soft blanket\n\nSquishing clay\n\nListening to familiar music\n\nLooking at family photos\n\nReceiving gentle massages with a favorite lotion\n\nEnjoying the outdoors in a safe and comfortable manner\n\nRemember that everyone is unique, and the progression of dementia varies significantly among individuals. Always tailor activities to the person’s individual abilities and interests. The goal is not to challenge them with difficult tasks but to provide comfort, stimulate their senses, and create opportunities for meaningful engagement.\n\nDementia care activities in memory care\n\nIf it’s becoming difficult to care for your loved one with dementia at home, you may want to consider memory care.\n\nHowever, if you’re not sure whether memory care communities will be able to fulfill and engage your loved one, here’s some internal data on how many communities within A Place for Mom’s network incorporate different types of activities:[01]\n\nOver 55% of memory care communities offer cooking activities, and about 70% offer art activities to engage residents in unique ways.\n\nOver 55% of communities offer reminiscence programs dedicated to helping seniors recall cherished memories.\n\nOver 52% of communities offer sensory-based programs to engage residents with dementia through sound, touch, scent, taste, and sight.\n\nOver 78% of communities offer musical activities like karaoke and live musical performances to soothe common dementia symptoms.\n\nOver 70% of communities offer an enclosed courtyard to help residents enjoy the outdoors in a safe manner.\n\nIf you’re not quite ready to move your loved one but still want help around the home, you can look into home care.\n\nTo help you learn more about care options, reach out to A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors. They can offer advice and help you find local care options that meet your loved one’s unique needs and preferences, all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [Assisted Living vs. Home Care by Melissa Bean on 2024-09-17](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-home-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living and home care provide similar support, with support focused on activities of daily living like bathing and dressing.\n\nAssisted living offers many on-site activities to keep residents engaged, while an in-home caregiver provides companionship for the senior they help.\n\nHome care can become more expensive than assisted living if you need more than five hours of care per day.\n\nBoth home care and assisted living can be customized depending on your loved one’s care needs and preferences.\n\nWhat is assisted living?\n\nAssisted living communities are designed for seniors who need help with activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Housing, meals, and social activities are usually provided. Plus, some assisted living communities help seniors coordinate on-site skilled nursing services to prevent a move if their care needs change.\n\nBenefits of assisted living\n\nMany elderly people might prefer to stay at home longer because they fear change, says Michelle Aweshah, a regional manager at A Place for Mom. However, over time, assisted living communities can feel like home, too.\n\nSeniors in assisted living, as well as their loved ones, can look forward to multiple benefits.\n\nFlexibility\n\nAssisted living can provide either short-term or long-term care, depending on a resident’s needs — it doesn’t have to be a permanent decision.\n\n“Some people feel assisted living might be their ‘final place’ and are afraid that they won’t like it once they move,” says Aweshah. “The great news is, in most cases, assisted living communities only require a 30-day notification of a move, even if you signed to stay a year.”\n\nRound-the-clock care\n\nIn addition to providing flexibility, assisted living offers care day and night, as needed. The various skills of staff members in assisted living play a pivotal role in supporting the well-being and safety of residents.\n\n“There are aides on staff around the clock to assist with personal care needs,” says Aweshah. “Most communities also have nurses on-site, as well as mobile services for physician appointments, therapy services, and more.”\n\nSocial activities and services\n\n“For many, being home may feel independent, but if they’re unable to drive, don’t visit friends as often anymore, or don’t eat as well, this can be very isolating and can lead to depression,” says Aweshah. “Being ‘independent’ can quickly become a detriment to quality and longevity of life.”\n\nAssisted living communities provide planned on- and off-site leisure activities as well as social activities, like happy hours and holiday celebrations, which are all very popular with residents.

Standard home care offers companionship and support with daily activities, while home health care provides seniors with nursing assistance such as wound care and administering IVs or injections.\n\nRead more:Home Care vs. Home Health Care: What's the Difference?\n\nBenefits of home care\n\nHome care allows seniors to remain in their homes while having regular company and professional care. Aside from enjoying the comfort of familiar surroundings, seniors can benefit from several other aspects of home care.\n\nCompanionship\n\nA major benefit of home care is that it offers one-on-one companionship. Some home care aides will plan in-home activities — such as reading aloud, playing games, or simply sitting and talking — to keep seniors engaged. They can tailor meaningful care services to the unique preferences and needs of your loved one.\n\nHelp with activities of daily living\n\nIn-home caregivers provide seniors with assistance for personal care tasks as well as helping out around the house. It’s typical for a caregiver to help with:\n\nMeal preparation\n\nHousekeeping\n\nTransportation\n\nBathing\n\nBathroom assistance\n\nDressing\n\nGrooming\n\nCustomizable care\n\nYou can decide what in-home caregivers focus on based on your loved one’s needs and lifestyle. It’s easy to customize care services. For example, if your loved one is social, regular transportation to events and activities can be organized as part of the caregiver’s routine. If someone prefers to stay at home and would rather have more help with cooking or cleaning, in-home caregivers can arrange that, as well.\n\nMany home care agencies will note whether they have caregivers experienced in specialized forms of care. This can be helpful for seniors with a progressive illness — such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, or a disability — to receive the customized care they need.\n\nRead more:Home Care for Disabled Seniors: Here's What You Need to Know\n\nCost of assisted living vs. in-home care\n\nThe median nationwide cost of assisted living is $4,995 per month, according to A Place for Mom’s 2024 report on the cost of long-term care and senior living. In comparison, the national median cost of in-home care is $30 per hour. For full-time care at home, the cost is $5,720 per month, based on a schedule of 44 hours per week.[01]\n\nAt nearly a $725 difference per month, finances can definitely play a role in choosing care. However, it’s important to consider what you get with each type of care and how these costs are determined before making a decision.\n\nHow are assisted living costs calculated?\n\nAssisted living costs typically include care services, housing, and meals in one monthly fee. The monthly costs can vary greatly depending on factors like apartment size, state of residence, whether your senior loved one chooses to live with a roommate, and their required level of care.\n\nWhat costs are associated with home care?\n\nJust like with any market, in-home care prices depend on supply and demand. Costs for home care can vary greatly based on your location, the home care agency, staff salaries, and more. Remember that home health care is a little different, because it’s medical care ordered by a physician and may be covered by Medicare or private insurance.\n\nFamilies and seniors considering home care should evaluate additional, related costs, like utilities, maintenance repairs, and groceries. For an in-depth look at how the cost of home care would compare to assisted living costs in your area, try using A Place for Mom’s senior living cost calculator. You’ll be able to factor in common home expenses like utilities, groceries, and home maintenance when weighing your senior care options.\n\nHow can I pay for assisted living and home care?\n\nThere are a variety of ways to afford assisted living or home care for your loved one. It’s important to consider that each situation is unique and that not everyone will be eligible for the options presented below. Programs and policies may also change without notice.\n\nPayment options for assisted living may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nPublic programs. Medicaid, Medicaid waivers, and Medicare may cover some expenses related to assisted living.\n\nVA and military benefits. Veterans, veteran spouses, Gold Star families, and other eligible military-connected people may be able to use pensions, disability compensation, and military retirement funds to pay for care.\n\nInsurance. Your loved one may be able to have some expenses covered by their private health insurance or their long-term care insurance.\n\nPaying out of pocket. Investments, retirement funds, savings, home equity, and more may be used to pay for assisted living expenses.\n\nIn some cases, related services and costs for assisted living may be covered while room and board isn’t. Check with the program or policy you wish to use for more information on what they cover and what you’ll be responsible for.\n\nSimilar to assisted living payment options, your loved one may be able to pay for home care through the following options:\n\nGovernment-funded initiatives. Medicare, Medicaid, and the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) may help with expenses related to in-home care.\n\nVeterans benefits. Eligible military-connected individuals may be able to use pensions, disability compensation, or military retirement funds to cover the cost of in-home care. Some expenses may be covered through VA health care or TRICARE coverage.\n\nInsurance programs. Your loved one may be able to utilize a long-term care or life insurance policy to cover in-home care expenses.\n\nPrivate pay. Retirement funds, pension funds, savings, and other investments may be used to pay for in-home care.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nAssisted living vs. home care: Which is best for my family member?\n\nFor seniors who need some daily assistance but remain independent and prefer to age at home, home care may be a good choice. However, if someone requires more than four or five hours of home care a day, assisted living may be the better choice financially.\n\n“It’s a personal decision, and it can be difficult to reach out or ask for any type of assistance,” says Aweshah. “It’s always best to prepare yourself with the most information possible so you can make a choice that’s right for you and your loved one.”\n\nA Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors are available to assist with your senior living journey every step of the way. From sending you information about local in-home care agencies to scheduling tours at assisted living communities, they can help answer all of your questions regarding senior living — all at no cost to your family.\n\nOriginal article by former A Place for Mom editor Merritt Whitley",
      "# [50+ Engaging Memory Care Activities for Seniors by Nirali Desai on 2024-07-10](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-activities)\nKey Takeaways\n\nMemory care activities must be personalized to soothe and stimulate residents, improve their cognitive function, and reduce common dementia symptoms.\n\nMemory care activity ideas are diverse and informed by residents, and they include favorite exercises, social events, and creative hobbies.\n\nMemory care communities promote reminiscence by incorporating familiar music, movies, foods, and scents into activities to help with residents’ memory recall and mood.\n\nMemory care activity calendars vary between communities, so talk to a senior living expert to find a suitable fit for a loved one with dementia.\n\nBenefits of memory care activities\n\nResearch shows that therapeutically stimulating activities for memory care patients have many benefits in long-term care settings. For instance, it can improve cognitive function, communication skills, and promote self-worth. It can also reduce loneliness, reliance on medications, and occurrence of common dementia symptoms.[01]\n\n“We’re providing the care [residents] need, but we’re also providing them with the engagement and opportunities they’re interested in and passionate about,” says Libbi Hash, national director of wellness and memory care programming at Kisco Senior Living.\n\nMemory care communities even encourage residents’ families to get involved and share their loved one’s interests, abilities, and preferences if their loved one is unable to. This can help communities personalize activity plans to better accommodate each resident.\n\nMany of the following activities can be adapted to engage dementia patients at home. However, memory care communities, care homes, and even some nursing homes provide increased support, supervision, trained professionals, and a range of proper equipment and materials to provide a larger variety of activities in a safe and social manner.\n\nPhysical activities and exercises in memory care\n\nPhysical activity is a crucial factor in improving brain health. It can help improve cognitive function, promote independence, and improve psychological health.[02] It can also reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, mortality, and falls and increase a person’s overall health and longevity.\n\nSome common physical exercises found in a memory care community include:\n\nWalking. Many communities offer walking groups for seniors to join and walk safely on secure and supervised grounds. You can even find scheduled activities where walking is involved, like scavenger hunts and art walks.\n\nGardening. Gardening is a great way to restore dexterity and strength.[03] Some communities offer raised garden beds for seniors to safely continue tending to beloved plants and flowers.\n\nDancing. Communities may host dance classes for residents with varied mobility levels. For example, residents with low mobility are instructed to do simple movements in a chair.\n\nTai chi. Harvard Medical School notes that this exercise can improve cognitive function. It’s also exceptionally easy for individuals with dementia to follow its specific movements.[04]\n\nChair yoga. This exercise is great for those with varying mobility levels since residents do poses and stretches while seated in a chair. It helps with flexibility, strength, and blood flow.\n\nApproximately 70% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network offer a combination of some of the fitness activities listed above.[05]\n\nSocial activities for memory care residents\n\nCognitive impairment from a dementia diagnosis may feel isolating, resulting in anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Therefore, it’s important for seniors to socialize as it can help them feel valued and supported.[06]\n\nProviding a healthy social environment can help seniors with dementia regain a sense of self-worth, have a more positive attitude toward life, and develop better eating and exercise habits.[06]\n\nTo help seniors socialize, memory care staff members often introduce seniors to one another based on their interests. To make introductions natural, staff often encourage residents to sit together during meals or in communal spaces like a courtyard or living area.\n\nCommon social activities include a variety of activities favored by residents of the community:\n\nGame nights. Most communities host game nights or have game rooms to help seniors gather and engage in familiar card, tile, and board games.\n\nMovie nights. Many communities have a theater on-site where residents’ favorite movies are showcased.\n\nIce cream socials. A tasty treat like ice cream can serve as a positive distraction for seniors who aren’t usually sociable. Ice cream can help seniors show enthusiasm or bring back childhood memories, making it easier to spark a conversation.\n\nCooking classes. Some communities help residents follow beloved family recipes to stimulate appetite and utilize aromatherapy and taste therapy. These therapies are especially beneficial because scents and flavors can elicit memory more quickly than sights and sounds. Residents can participate in various ways — they can stick to reading the recipe, observing, or solely coming to relish the finished dish.\n\nInterest clubs or groups. Oftentimes, communities offer clubs for seniors with different interests and capabilities. Popular options include book clubs, walking groups, and gardening clubs.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s memory care network, over 60% of communities offer a gardening club and about 56% of communities offer cooking activities to bring residents together.[05]\n\nRead more: The Benefits of Socialization for Seniors in Senior Living\n\nCreative activities for seniors in memory care\n\nEngaging activities like music lessons and arts and crafts offer a creative outlet for memory care residents, no matter their level of skill or cognitive ability. Studies show that painting, drawing, crafting, musical activities, and even browsing art styles allow freedom of expression and a chance to exercise fine motor skills.[07]\n\nArtistic activities and crafts\n\nArt therapy involves encouraging artistically inclined residents to express themselves using their medium of choice. Artistic expression is known to help soothe dementia symptoms and engage the brain.\n\nMemory care communities may include the following types of arts and crafts in their programming:\n\nCollaging and scrapbooking. Residents cut out pictures from old magazines to create a meaningful or themed collage. They can also use their personal pictures to create a memory scrapbook.\n\nArt shows. This might consist of showing immersive video tours of art museums or slideshows of popular paintings. Some communities may even invite local artists to display their collections in an on-site gallery and allow residents to purchase pieces to hang in their rooms.\n\nPottery or clay projects. Residents can sculpt clay into figurines, decorations like holiday ornaments, or functional objects like pinch pots. The finished pieces might be displayed in common areas or used to decorate a resident’s room.\n\nPainting. Residents can paint on their own in a designated art studio or as a group while following an instructor.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s network, nearly 75% of memory care communities offer arts and crafts activities to help residents engage their creative side.[05]\n\nMusical activities\n\nMusic therapy for dementia involves listening to familiar music to promote reminiscence. It’s known to help enhance memory, reduce agitation, and improve cognition.[08]\n\nTo help seniors reminisce using music, memory care communities typically incorporate the following musical activities:\n\nPlaying classic records. Communities might play classics in the background during other activities like game nights or classes. Or, they may provide a jukebox or CD player with classic tunes in a common area, so residents can listen and reminisce at their leisure.\n\nInstrumental music classes. Memory care residents can attend music lessons to learn new skills, hone old ones, and enjoy themselves. A local musician or the activities director might lead these sessions. These classes are usually designed for all skill levels to participate and include easy-to-use instruments like the triangle or maracas.\n\nKaraoke nights or singalongs. Singing favorite songs or getting together to sing holiday carols or hymns can help promote socialization and joy among residents.\n\nListening to music on a portable music player. Some communities provide residents an easy-to-use music player, like an iPod, loaded with their favorite songs. This allows residents to listen to their tunes whenever they’d like. Oftentimes, family members are involved in suggesting their loved one’s favorite musicians or songs.\n\nNearly 79% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network offer some combination of the musical activities listed above.[05]\n\nIs memory care the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nProductive and meaningful activities\n\n“Everyone has a need to feel useful, no matter what stage of life they’re in,” Hash says.\n\nActivities that help residents reflect and feel productive are crucial in memory care. While productive activities may look different in each community, some of the most common include engaging in life skill stations and daily tasks.\n\nLife skill stations\n\nSince many older adults with dementia mentally revert to a time when they were younger, memory care communities aim to simulate common settings from residents’ pasts. These replications are called autonomous engagement stations — or life skill stations — and they aim to provide a familiar environment for residents to feel safe and reflect.\n\n“If a resident is restless at night and wants to get up, the autonomous areas are a safe setting where they can go and engage in an activity that brings them comfort or a sense of satisfaction,” Hash says.\n\nLife skills stations are built around a specific task or occupation, such as:\n\nOffice work. Residents can sit at a desk stocked with props like a typewriter, phone, notepads, calculator, and stamps.\n\nTinkering. A resident who worked in a skilled trade or enjoyed do-it-yourself home improvement projects might benefit from a simulated workshop setting with blunt tools, smooth wood, and toolboxes.\n\nChildcare. Nurturing dolls increases engagement and communication and reduces symptoms of distress in people with dementia.[09] This station might feature dolls, a crib, bottles, and baby clothes to fold.\n\nPet care. Communities may offer realistic robotic cats or dogs for residents to care for. Interaction with robotic pets has been shown to have similar benefits to therapy with live pets.\n\nDaily tasks\n\nStaff at memory care communities create opportunities for those with dementia to continue to be productive in ways that give them meaning and joy. This approach is sometimes called the Montessori Method or life skills engagement. It involves helping seniors revive skills and interests — even if physical abilities have deteriorated from dementia — rather than redirecting them to easier tasks.\n\nMemory care calendars may include various life skills tasks to help residents feel accomplished and motivated. Examples could include some of the following everyday activities:\n\nHelping others. Residents can help the kitchen staff out by washing vegetables or buttering bread. Or, maybe they could deliver mail to other residents.\n\nCleaning. Sweeping up hallways or wiping tables keeps their shared environment clean.\n\nSetting the table. Making centerpieces for tables in the dining room or setting out the plates can be a satisfying activity for some residents.\n\nCreating something to donate. Some communities may host activities where residents knit, crochet, quilt, or sew items to donate to local organizations, like homeless shelters, hospitals, or animal shelters.\n\nWatering plants. Many memory care communities have plants in shared spaces or courtyards to liven up the environment. Residents can help care for the plants by watering them occasionally.\n\nStimulating activities for memory care residents\n\nAfter a dementia diagnosis, it becomes crucial to identify brain-stimulating activities that work for each unique individual. To engage different parts of the brain in various ways, memory care communities use a variety of cognitive and tactile activities.\n\nStimulating memory games\n\nCognitive stimulation therapy is an evidence-based treatment used in people with mild to moderate dementia.[10] Its goal is to guide people with dementia through a series of themed activities — like memory games — to promote continued learning and improve working memory. Common activities include things like the following:\n\nJigsaw puzzles. Putting together colorful puzzle pieces can improve visual-spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills in dementia patients.\n\nWord search puzzles. This familiar activity can provide comfort and help exercise residents’ brains.\n\nMaze games. Following a maze can help improve fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination in memory care residents.\n\nCard-matching games. Matching shapes, colors, or numbers can help with memory recall and concentration.\n\nDice games. Rolling die can help improve fine motor skills, increase attention span, and help them practice counting.\n\nBingo. This senior-favored game can help memory care residents socialize while promoting their listening skills and hand-eye coordination.\n\nWithin A Place for Mom’s memory care network, over 55% of communities offer specific brain fitness activities and exercises to help seniors improve cognitive function.[05]\n\nTactile stimulation activities\n\nThe sense of touch can help memory care residents feel joyful and secure, which can in turn soothe some common dementia symptoms.[01] Communities use tactile stimulation in a variety of ways:\n\nSensory bins. These boxes are typically filled with items of different sizes, shapes, materials, and textures designed to provide tactile stimulation. Each bin’s contents may be based on a theme, such as a holiday, a season, a color, or a location.\n\nPlay a guessing game. Encouraging residents to close their eyes and identify an object, like a stuffed bear or wooden spoon, by touch can be fun and engaging.\n\nSort different fabrics. Collecting samples of fabrics like velvet, fur, or silk to sort can be soothing for memory care residents.\n\nPlay with fidgets. Providing a fidget toy or board with knobs, zippers, and unique textures can help keep hands busy and calm dementia patients.\n\nHoliday celebrations in memory care\n\nCelebrating common holidays — and some lesser-known ones like National Flower Day is one way memory care facilities foster community. It can add excitement and variety for residents who don’t get to celebrate holidays the same way they used to.\n\nTo help residents feel included and joyous during mainstream holidays, many memory care communities host fun activities:\n\nDecorating the community. Community staff put up decorations and sometimes allow residents to contribute to spark memories and help them anticipate the upcoming holiday.\n\nHoliday parties. On holidays like Valentine’s Day, Halloween, and Christmas, many communities host parties with themed decorations and snacks to encourage socialization and bring festivities to life. Many communities allow visitors to some events so loved ones can celebrate together.\n\nThemed activities. Oftentimes, communities will add holiday-related variations to common activities. For instance, a Christmas-themed scavenger hunt or a Halloween-themed bingo night.\n\nNontraditional holiday activities. Nowadays, unique holidays, like National Coffee Day or National Watermelon Day, are more popularly celebrated. Communities often incorporate unique tastings or social events to freshen up the calendar.\n\nOver 80% of memory care communities within A Place for Mom’s network host holiday parties and celebrations for residents.[05]\n\nMemory care questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nPet therapy activities\n\nReminiscence activities with loved ones\n\nTechnological activities in memory care\n\nEngaging technology can slow cognitive decline and improve well-being in seniors with dementia.[13] Technology can also help memory care communities appeal to residents’ individual histories and interests.\n\nBelow are three stimulating technologies that memory care communities use to engage seniors with dementia:\n\nWatching live streams or immersive tours. With internet and virtual tours, memory care residents can visit zoos, aquariums, and museums around the world. A group of birdwatchers could enjoy the soothing bird calls of a wildlife preserve, while art lovers may be stimulated by a group “tour” of the Louvre in Paris. Communities may even augment these virtual experiences with props, like binoculars for birdwatchers or a map to simulate museum tours.\n\nParticipating in virtual reality (VR). VR technology can help people with dementia recall past memories, reduce aggression, and improve interactions with caregivers.[14] Many tech-forward memory care communities incorporate VR devices to help residents “visit” favorite places, like the beach or mountains, safely.\n\nEngaging with Snoezelen rooms. Seniors experiencing significant cognitive decline may not be able to participate in activities they enjoyed during the early stages of dementia. Snoezelen rooms use technology to fill a room with sensory stimulants. Common features include projections, aromatherapy devices, sound machines, and light features to help residents fully immerse themselves.\n\nPlaying video games. Some communities offer soothing and engaging video games — like Wii Sports, Candy Crush, or Tetris — to stimulate memory care residents. Video games are proven to improve cognitive health in older adults because of the engagement and memory recall required while playing.[15]\n\nHow memory care communities personalize activities\n\nPerson-centered care for dementia uses personal histories, stories, and interests to help residents thrive in memory care communities. This approach is important when curating memory care programming ideas to help personalize activities based on unique personalities.\n\n“When a new resident moves in, we learn their likes, dislikes, and interests. We create activities and encourage participation based on those passions,” Hash says. “As residents transition through their journey and aren’t as capable, we can modify what they’re doing so they’re still able to participate.”\n\nBy understanding preferences, pasts, and emotional needs, a community can design activities to best fit each resident’s personality, interests, and abilities. Memory care communities consider the group of residents, in addition to individual interests, to create their monthly activities calendar.\n\n“As our resident population changes, so do our autonomous stations, the activities we plan, and even the hours we do things,” Hash explains.\n\nThere are many ways community activities and schedules may vary by resident population:\n\nRural communities may offer activities like canning and vegetable gardening that might not be as popular in large cities.\n\nCommunities with many religious residents may offer more frequent services, devotions, and religious studies throughout the week.\n\nFacilities with residents who worked overnight shifts when they were younger may offer select activities throughout the night.\n\nAutonomous engagement stations can reflect popular local jobs and settings — if many residents were employed by a local store, for example, there could be a simulated environment with a faux cash register or shelves filled with artificial products.\n\nMemory care activities calendar\n\nBefore moving a loved one into memory care, it’s important to get a sense of the activities offered to residents. When touring, ask for the community’s memory care activities calendar. It should include all the activities offered by staff each month, along with the specific times your loved one can expect to participate. Families should also ask how easily their loved one’s interests and hobbies might be able to be incorporated into the monthly schedule.\n\nHere’s a sample memory care activities calendar:\n\nGet help with finding a memory care community\n\nMany families choose a memory care facility based on its robust memory care activity programming.

      "# [11 Signs It Might Be Time for Assisted Living by Rebecca Schier-Akamelu on 2024-11-27](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/signs-its-time-for-assisted-living)\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are many signs that your parent may need assisted living, including needing assistance with activities of daily living, chores, and home maintenance.\n\nAssisted living isn’t a good fit for all seniors, such as those who have complex medical needs or late-stage dementia.\n\nAssisted living can help with socialization and nutrition because these communities offer a range of engaging activities and accommodations for seniors' dietary needs.\n\nCaregiver burnout or overburdening shouldn’t be ignored since this can strain the relationship with a senior loved one.\n\n1. Activities of daily living are difficult to do\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing, bathing, and using the toilet present frequent concerns for seniors. Approximately 13.4% of adults 75+ needed personal care assistance in 2023, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[01]\n\nAssisted living communities provide help with these daily tasks, which benefits both seniors and their caregivers. Linda Lagesse, 78, served as her husband’s sole caregiver for nearly four years. An inability to assist with ADLs motivated her to contact A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors to find assisted living for her husband.\n\n“I bathed him. I dressed him. I tried to help him get exercise,” Lagesse recalls. “I was exhausted. It just got to be a lot.”\n\n2. Medications are mismanaged\n\nErrors in medication management can pose a real danger for seniors: The CDC estimates 600,000 seniors over 65 visit emergency rooms each year due to misuse of prescriptions.[02] Maureen Bradley, a former executive director for senior living communities who now supports new Senior Living Advisors at A Place for Mom, notes that medication management is an excellent service that assisted living provides.\n\nAssisted living communities can give reminders to residents to take their medications on time, or administer the medicines to residents if needed. This helps ensure that each senior takes the correct medicine at the right dose and time.\n\n“It’s very important to find out how medication management is administered, as there are subtle differences from one community to the next. For example, some communities require that residents use a certain pharmacy because that makes it easier for the communities to track and store medications. Also, in terms of cost, some of the communities include medication management in their base pricing and others charge for it separately,” says Bradley.\n\nRead more:An Overview of Medication Policy and Procedure for Assisted Living\n\n3. Care is needed, but not at a high level\n\nIn general, seniors in assisted living are mostly independent, but they may need help with brushing their teeth, taking their medications, showering, or with other activities of daily living. Seniors may also choose assisted living for socialization and mental stimulation. To see if your loved one would thrive in an assisted living setting, nurses typically perform a pre-move assessment.\n\nBarbara Levison, a geriatric care manager and the president of Florida’s Aging Life Care Association chapter, urges families and caregivers to educate themselves on the various types of care available and the many differences between those options.\n\n“If your loved one is experiencing cognitive decline and needs constant supervision, then they would need memory care as opposed to an assisted living facility,” says Levison. “Also, if it’s difficult for them to hold a conversation, they would be more comfortable in a memory care facility where residents have similar abilities.”\n\nBradley notes that assisted living facilities may not be ideal for seniors with advanced medical needs. Instead, these seniors might need a nursing home.\n\n“Certain medical conditions are not a good fit for assisted living. That being said, not every assisted living community accepts or rejects the same kinds of care needs. Each community makes its own determination about how much care is too much. Some common medical conditions that are beyond the normal scope of care for assisted living include advanced dementia, any conditions that require a permanent IV, serious or multiple wounds, and comorbidities, which is multiple serious medical conditions at once,” Bradley says.\n\n4. Isolation is causing loneliness\n\nIf your loved one is living at home, they may have little social interaction with other people their age, which can lead to loneliness and depression. Seniors in assisted living, however, often form connections with other residents, staff members, or even community pets.\n\n“Older adults [in assisted living] have the opportunity to interact with people their own age throughout the day,” says Bradley. “They’re also exposed to people of different generations in the form of staff and visiting family and friends. Many communities are pet friendly, which allows folks the chance to enjoy furry friends. Even if a resident doesn’t have a dog of their own, for example, they can enjoy their neighbor’s.”\n\nThese friendships can help prevent senior isolation, as well as increase a senior’s likelihood of participating in enriching activities. Assisted living communities encourage residents to get involved with senior-friendly activities like fitness classes, happy hours, game nights, and more.\n\nRead more:Beyond Bingo: The 50+ Best Activities for Seniors in Assisted Living\n\n5. Care coordination has become challenging\n\nIf it has become difficult to coordinate care for your loved one, it may signal the need for assisted living. For instance, before his move to assisted living, Lagesse’s husband experienced frequent health issues that continued to land him in the hospital.\n\n“He kept getting sick, which meant that he was not getting the care he needed from me,” Lagesse said.\n\nIn addition to the emotional and physical toll of these hospitalizations, her husband’s regular appointments with many doctors and specialists could become overwhelming.\n\nTo simplify this process, assisted living communities help coordinate care for residents. Doctors, physical therapists, and other health professionals may even provide their services within the community. For residents who wish to continue to see their own doctors and care providers, many communities provide transportation to nearby clinics.\n\nAdditionally, Bradley notes that care staff are in frequent communication with a resident’s physician.\n\n“Assisted living facilities excel at care coordination. They’re often better at keeping physicians informed than families or home caregivers were. This is because they have regulations or systems in place where they fax accident and incident reports to the doctor, as well as medication records, just by regular course,” says Bradley.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\n6. Home maintenance is neglected\n\nDaily chores and home upkeep can raise stress significantly for ailing seniors and their caregivers. Home repairs can be complex and expensive, and may be unsafe for seniors. If you start to notice that your loved one’s home is always messy, assisted living might be the right move.\n\nAssisted living communities remove these responsibilities by providing services like:\n\nVacuuming\n\nDusting\n\nBed-making\n\nBathroom cleaning\n\nLaundry assistance\n\nCommunity maintenance\n\nTrash removal\n\nSidewalk and driveway clearing\n\nLimb, leaf, and debris removal\n\nGeneral landscaping\n\n7. Poor nutrition is affecting their health\n\nSeniors at home may lack the energy or resources to grocery shop. It’s also common for seniors living alone to lose interest in cooking. This can have negative effects on senior nutrition and can lead to things like unintentional weight loss or gain. Seniors on specialized diets, such low- or no-salt, may have additional health problems. In assisted living, seniors can enjoy nutritious meals without the hassle of cooking. Meals are often a social event where residents can dine with their friends.\n\nDining in assisted living is flexible, too. You can find the following features and options in most assisted living communities:\n\nComplete nutrition and ingredients that touch on every food group\n\nFresh fruit, healthy snacks, and drinks available at any time\n\nDaily menu with always-available options\n\nThe option to select a special meal plan that accounts for diabetic, low-sodium, kosher, and other diets\n\nDining rooms designed to foster conversation during meals\n\n8. Family caregiver experiences burnout\n\nIt’s necessary to consider how caregiving affects you or the family caregiver. Unfortunately, caregivers are often the last to notice their own burnout and fatigue. In these situations, family members and friends can act as accountability partners in protecting their mental and emotional health.\n\n“One of my friends stayed with my husband so that I could get away for a couple of days,” Lagesse recalls. “When I got home, he met me at the front door and said, ‘Linda, you cannot continue to do this. This is too much.’ That was really the turning point. It was eight days later that my husband ended up back in the hospital. I knew I had to do something. I couldn’t continue to do what I was doing.”\n\nLevison encourages families to act sooner rather than later if they think it’s time for assisted living.\n\n“In my experience, families and caregivers often wait until things are progressing to a breaking point before looking for assisted living options,” says Levison. And, she adds, both senior well-being and caregiver mental health may be strained by the time many families begin looking for care.\n\nRead more:Becoming a Family Caregiver: Costs and Support\n\n9. Home isn’t safe\n\nMany homes aren’t built with seniors in mind. Your loved one may have a bedroom upstairs that’s becoming difficult for them to access, smaller hallways that aren’t wheelchair or walker friendly, or a bathtub that’s become difficult to step into.\n\nA big advantage of assisted living communities is that they’re designed to meet the needs of seniors. The following are common features of assisted living communities:\n\nWide doorways and walkways\n\nWalk-in showers\n\nPersonal alert systems or alarm cords in the apartment\n\nNon-slip flooring\n\nBradley notes that the need for these safety features may vary by resident, but it’s still something she appreciates in an assisted living community.\n\n“Even for people who may not need those features today, it’s wise to choose communities that offer them in case needs change over time,” Bradley says.\n\nAssisted living questions?

Needs exceed what you can provide\n\nIn Bradley’s opinion, it’s time for assisted living when the need for help outweighs the resources available.\n\n“As we age, we start to need help with ADLs, basic housework, and home maintenance. At first, family and friends can be asked to help. It even makes sense, for a time, to consider home care as a means of support. But at some point, the cost of assistance — be it financial or just a time drain on the family — becomes too great. At that point, it makes sense to consider assisted living,” says Bradley.\n\nIt can be difficult to know if you’ve reached this point, but the following questions can help:\n\nAre you or other family members missing too much time at work or sacrificing other obligations to care for your loved one on a regular basis?\n\nDoes your loved one need overnight support?\n\nIs the cost of an in-home caregiver becoming a financial burden for your loved one or other family members?\n\nIs your relationship with your loved one becoming strained as you focus more on your responsibilities as a caregiver?\n\nIf you’ve answered yes to these questions, you may be at the point where it makes sense to consider an assisted living facility.\n\nBradley notes that this can be very difficult for families to realize.\n\n“Even though caring for a loved one can be incredibly demanding and difficult, it’s also hard to let go. This is a very common occurrence. I’d recommend that caregivers make a plan to visit their loved ones regularly, but make a concerted effort to keep the visits social in nature. That can be having lunch, playing Bingo together, enjoying a movie, going for a walk or any number of other activities. When I was an executive director, I used to say to family members, ‘Let us be the caregivers. That’s what you’re paying us for. You just concentrate on being the daughter again.’”\n\nNext steps for finding assisted living\n\nIf you think assisted living could be right for your loved one, you may be wondering what your next steps should be. Moving to assisted living is a big life change for both you and your loved one, but don’t shy away from the challenge.\n\nThe following steps are helpful to keep in mind as you navigate this change with your parent:\n\nDecide how to talk to your parent about assisted living. Take a moment to consider whether you’ll bring this up first with your senior loved one, other family members, or discuss it as a group. Keep in mind that there’s no right answer here. You know your family dynamics best, but do include your loved one as early in the process as you can. No matter how you bring up assisted living, be prepared to listen to your loved one and plan for multiple discussions.\n\nGather important documents. Now is the time to gather your parent’s essential documents, whether financial, legal, or health related. These could include life insurance policies, a long-term care insurance policy, military discharge paperwork, a trust, or a living will. Having these ahead of time will help you make a plan to pay for care. Some insurance policies or benefits may have a waiting period, so gather these sooner rather than later.\n\nFeel confident and prepared to tour. Our assisted living touring guide helps you identify what to look for in a community and the key questions to ask when you visit.\n\nDecide what’s most important in a community. Knowing what your parent wants and needs in a community is one of the most important parts of finding the right fit. If the idea of choosing an assisted living community sounds challenging, we’re here to help. You can talk with one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors to learn more about assisted living communities near you. They’ll account for your loved one’s need and specific budget to set up tours with local communities accordingly — all at no cost to you.",
      "# [Assisted Living vs. Memory Care: 5 Key Differences by Merritt Whitley on 2024-09-20](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-vs-memory-care)\nKey Takeaways\n\nAssisted living provides caregiver assistance that focuses on activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing.\n\nMemory care provides specialized assistance for seniors with dementia that focuses on safety in a specially designed environment.\n\nSome assisted living communities offer memory care on-site, making it easy for seniors to get the care they need without moving.\n\nMemory care costs more than assisted living due to the added care and supervision that residents need.\n\nThe differences between assisted living and memory care\n\nIt’s normal to wonder about your loved one’s care needs, whether they have a dementia diagnosis or you’re simply noticing a change in their cognitive abilities. About 70% of adults older than 65 will need long-term care, and many will have some type of cognitive decline or memory loss.[01]\n\nMaureen Bradley gained valuable experience working in assisted living communities and as a memory care director before joining A Place for Mom. She explains the overlap between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“The average age in assisted living these days is around 85, and that age group makes up nearly three-quarters of the people who have dementia. What this means is that it’s very common for people in assisted living communities to be in the early stages of dementia,” says Bradley.\n\nStill, you’ll want to evaluate both types of senior living communities carefully to make sure your parent’s needs will be met.\n\n1. Safety\n\nGeneral assisted living communities may offer safety features like in-room emergency alert systems and daily check-ins. For seniors with memory loss, increased safety is a major concern, as wandering, aggression, and falls are common and dangerous dementia behaviors.\n\nTo help keep residents safe, memory care-specific communities often have added security features such as:\n\nLocked entrances and exits\n\nKeypad entries\n\nObscured exits\n\nDoorbells that signal entering and exiting\n\nTo reduce anxiety and avoid injuries from falls, facility layouts include design elements that minimize confusion. Plus, memory care communities provide additional calming therapies within soothing spaces. This added level of care is aimed at reducing the agitation and confusion that may lead to aggression or self-injury in persons with dementia.\n\n2. Staff training and care\n\nStaff members at both assisted living and memory care facilities have experience supporting residents with day-to-day tasks. But staff at memory care facilities are specially trained in dementia care and provide supervision to residents around the clock. This helps seniors with dementia maintain cognitive skills, a sense of self, and quality of life for as long as possible.\n\n“Memory care communities tend to have a much higher caregiver-to-resident ratio. This is important because it can take longer to provide ADL care, and people in memory care often need more direct oversight for safety and social engagement,” says Bradley.\n\nCaregivers at memory care facilities are trained to effectively and compassionately prevent and manage difficult dementia behaviors, such as wandering and aggression. They understand the balance of encouraging residents to stay as independent as possible while providing the support they need.\n\nRead more:Person-Centered Care and Its Role In Assisted Living: A Guide\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\n3. Amenities\n\nAmenities vary greatly from one community to the next, but most assisted living communities offer the following:\n\nGyms\n\nBeauty salons and barber shops\n\nOutdoor spaces like gardens or courtyards\n\nPet-friendly accommodations\n\nTransportation services\n\nLibrary, TV, and game rooms\n\nArts and crafts studios\n\nSpas or relaxation rooms\n\nMemory care communities often feature many of these same amenities, but you’ll also find unique layouts and design features to help orient residents and reduce confusion. For instance, design elements in memory care communities may include the following:\n\nClearly defined common areas\n\nColor-coded walls to make it easier for residents with memory loss to find their way\n\nOutdoor gardens to prevent residents from feeling trapped or confined\n\nIncreased opportunities for personalization, like memory boxes outside of residents’ doors to guide and help them feel at home\n\n4. Activities and therapies\n\nAssisted living staff organize activities for active seniors who may need some help with everyday tasks. With this demographic in mind, assisted living offers plenty of social opportunities. A wide range of planned activities are scheduled to appeal to different interests. These activities may include:\n\nExercise classes\n\nBook clubs\n\nGames\n\nParties\n\nKaraoke\n\nOutings\n\nMemory care offers both group and individual memory care activities and therapies designed specifically for seniors with memory loss.\n\n“There’s focus on structure, sensory stimulation, getting direct sunlight whenever possible, and cultivating engagement. All of these things minimize or even eliminate sundowning, help with sleep patterns, and allow residents to enjoy their days,” Bradley says.\n\nMany memory care facilities provide activities tailored to residents’ interests and programs that encompass the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health.\n\nSome of the specialized therapies available at memory care communities may include the following:\n\nMusic therapy, which promotes relaxation and reduces agitation in seniors with Alzheimer’s or other types of dementia\n\nArt therapy, which may help slow cognitive decline\n\nReminiscence therapy, which uses senses like smell, taste, touch, and sight to help seniors remember people, events, and places\n\nPet therapy for companionship\n\n5. Costs\n\nMany factors affect the costs of assisted living and memory care, including the following:\n\nLocation\n\nRoom size\n\nWhether a space is shared with a roommate\n\nWhat services are provided\n\nBeyond this, costs are calculated a little differently for each care type.\n\nGeneralized assisted living communities typically charge a base monthly rate that covers the following:\n\nRoom and board with three meals a day and snacks\n\nMost activities (outings may cost extra)\n\nHousekeeping and laundry\n\nTransportation to and from medical appointments\n\nHelp with ADLs may be an additional charge, depending on how much assistance a resident needs.\n\nAcross A Place for Mom’s partner communities, the nationwide median price of assisted living community is $4,995 per month.[02] The cost of memory care tends to be higher, with a median monthly cost of $6,200 per month across our partner communities.[02]\n\nMemory care communities are more expensive because they offer specialized care and services that general assisted living communities typically don’t offer.\n\nAssisted living vs. memory care: What services are offered?\n\nThis chart summarizes the key differences in services offered at assisted living and memory care communities.\n\nServicesAssisted LivingMemory CareHelp with ADLsxxMeal servicexxMedication managementxxCare coordinationxxHousekeeping and laundry servicesxxExercise classesxxTransportation to appointmentsxxSpecialized care for dementia and memory lossx24-hour care and supervisionxxSecured entrances and exits to prevent wanderingxMemory-enhanced therapiesxHigh staff-to-resident ratioxUnique layouts to reduce confusionx\n\nRead related article:Find Assisted Living for Adults with Mental Illness: A How-To Guide\n\nHow to decide between assisted living and memory care\n\nBradley encourages families to be mindful of their loved one’s prognosis as they consider the main differences between assisted living and memory care.\n\n“It helps to understand the kind of dementia your loved one has and how quickly it is expected to progress,” says Bradley.\n\nSome seniors in the middle stages of dementia may begin to need a higher level of supervision. For others, this happens a little later. It’s best to include input from your loved one’s doctors or other caregivers when making a decision.\n\nChoosing assisted living\n\nAssisted living may be a good fit for your loved one if memory loss isn’t an immediate concern or if they’re in the early stages of dementia. Sometimes it may also be a good fit for seniors experiencing the middle stages of dementia, provided that they don’t wander.\n\n“Assisted living communities can be very helpful with things that matter during the early- and mid-stages of dementia, such as managing medications and helping with reminders for showering, meal times, and the like,” Bradley says.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how advanced your loved one’s dementia is, you may want to speak with their doctor to determine if they’re showing signs it might be time for memory care.\n\nChoosing memory care\n\nAs dementia progresses and symptoms worsen, many families do opt for memory care.\n\n“Oftentimes, safety is the driving factor for deciding it’s time to make the switch to memory care,” says Bradley. “If their loved one is prone to going for walks and getting lost, for example, assisted living is no longer an option. They may also start doing things like trying to drink their shampoo or get restless later in the day.”\n\nIn addition to a memory care facility’s built-in security features, the 24-hour oversight provided by staff in a memory care community can significantly add to a senior’s safety.\n\nMemory care in assisted living: A promising third option\n\nSome assisted living communities also offer advanced memory care units on-site, so that both care types are available within the same community. This can be a good long-term care option for seniors. For instance, a senior with early-stage dementia may be able to move to a general assisted living community first and then transition to the memory care level later, if needed.\n\n“This is the ideal situation,” says Bradley. “It’s much less traumatic for the person living with dementia to simply change rooms or locations in the same community. They know the staff, recognize the surroundings, and oftentimes there’s intermingling for activities and events. They can still see their friends.”\n\nOn the other hand, moving from one community to a completely new one may require more thoughtfulness from family members to help ensure that the move goes smoothly.\n\n“As dementia progresses, moving someone can be very hard on them and even trigger a big decline in condition,” says Bradley.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps as you consider memory care\n\nWhen you’re weighing options, it’s important to remember that each community is unique and what’s available to you will vary depending on your loved one’s location and budget.\n\n“I would strongly encourage families to check out a number of care settings,” says Bradley. “In some places, memory care may have advanced-stage dementia residents and look like a skilled nursing setting. Other memory care communities have more active, vibrant populations. There’s a wide variety of culture and care approaches, including specialized neighborhoods and the Montessori model.”\n\nAccording to Bradley, this might be the most important part of the process.\n\n“Finding the right fit for your loved one can make all the difference when it comes to quality of life for Mom or Dad and satisfaction for the rest of the family.”\n\nIf you’re looking for options in your area, A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors can help by considering your loved one’s lifestyle, budget, and abilities to make the right recommendations — all at no cost to your family.",
      "# [What Are Activities of Daily Living and How Are They Assessed? by Nirali Desai on 2024-07-10](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/adls-iadls)\nKey Takeaways\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs) are basic tasks a person has to do on their own to live independently, such as bathing, showering, dressing, and mobility.\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex activities a person does to care for themselves and their home, including cleaning, managing money or medications, shopping, and preparing meals.\n\nAssess your loved one’s ability to perform ADLS and IADLs using checklists to monitor any changes to their abilities.\n\nConsider a professional opinion or senior support options if you notice changes in a senior’s abilities to complete ADLs and IADLs.\n\nWhat are ADLs and IADLs?\n\nActivities of daily living (ADLs) are basic tasks needed for everyday life, while instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are more complex tasks needed to function independently and manage one’s own affairs.\n\nResearch shows that individuals over age 85 generally need assistance with daily living, with more than 20% of seniors over 85 requiring help with ADLs.[01]\n\nActivities of daily living examples\n\nHere’s a standard list of activities of daily living, as outlined by the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living:[02]\n\nBathing and showering — the ability to bathe and maintain personal hygiene\n\nContinence — having complete control of the bowels and bladder\n\nDressing — the ability to select appropriate clothes and outerwear for the weather or occasion and get dressed independently\n\nMobility — the ability to walk or transfer from one place to another, specifically in and out of a bed or chair\n\nFeeding (excluding meal preparation) — the ability to get food from plate to mouth and to chew and swallow\n\nToileting — the ability to get on and off the toilet and clean oneself without assistance\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living examples\n\nInstrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) require planning, problem-solving, and organizational skills. While ADLs are very fundamental, IADLs are skills that allow seniors to function independently and manage their own affairs. IADLs, as outlined by the Lawton-Brody scale, include the following:[03]\n\nHousekeeping and home maintenance — the ability to maintain a clean and safe home by mopping, doing laundry, or fixing minor things\n\nManaging money — the ability to budget and pay bills on time\n\nManaging medications — taking medications correctly and refilling them on time\n\nPreparing meals — the ability to plan, cook, and serve one’s own meals\n\nShopping for groceries and other necessities — remembering to get all the things one needs to eat and live properly on time\n\nTransportation — the ability to get around by driving oneself, arranging a pickup, or using public transportation\n\nUsing the phone or computer — the ability to answer phone calls, call others, or email others, if it’s something one has always done\n\nHow are ADLs and IADLs assessed?\n\nCaregivers can assess ADLs and IADLs in a variety of ways. You can use health care professional assessments, use caregiver input, or simply ask your loved one whether they’ve noticed changes in their abilities.\n\nProfessional ADL assessments\n\nHealth care professionals typically use one of the following three types of ADL assessments:\n\nThe Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living. This is generally for seniors in long-term care settings, where disability is generally more severe but stable. In this assessment, one point is gained for each ADL your loved one can complete independently. The total number of points at the end of the assessment shows how independent your loved one is and what level of assistance they may need.[02]\n\nThe Barthel ADL Index. This assessment covers two additional activities, including grooming and ability to climb stairs. It’s also for care settings and can detect subtle changes in a person’s health. In this assessment, the task levels are on a scaled point system. As with the Katz assessment, the more points you have in total, the more independent your loved one likely is.[04]\n\nThe Functional Independence Measure (FIM). This option is more comprehensive, combining ADLs with IADLs and other social activities. This assessment tool comprises 18 items divided into physical and mental categories. Each item is scored on a scale. The higher the score, the more independent your loved one is at performing the task.[05]\n\nCaregiver input\n\nCaregiver input can help create a bigger picture of your loved one’s functional abilities. Family or hired caregivers often notice when a senior needs more assistance than they used to. For example, a parent may start asking for help in situations they could once tackle alone.\n\nEXPERT TIPS: SIGNS IT'S TIME TO ASSESS ADLS AND IADLS\n\n• Pay attention to their driving habits. See if there are any signs of accidents or close calls, or if passengers feel worried when riding with them.\n\n• Check for health concerns. They may be more prone to falls or have had repeated trips to the ER or hospital recently.\n\n• Watch for signs of financial struggles. Look for unpaid bills or bounced checks sitting out, or for declined transactions when you’re out together.\n\n• Notice trouble with their memory. They may be forgetting important things or using poor judgment, which can put them in danger.\n\nSelf-reporting\n\nSelf-reporting can also help get the conversation about ADLs and IADLs started. No one understands a situation better than the person experiencing it.\n\nSelf-reporting is especially helpful when individuals have minimal cognitive decline. A senior may be more honest about their struggles or remember situations better if their memory is working well. Keep in mind that self-reporting can introduce bias, as your loved one may not feel an incident is worth recording when it really is.\n\nProfessional opinion\n\nFamilies rarely ask about ADLs until a parent or senior loved one is going through the process of assessment for long-term care, says Dr. Leslie Kernisan, a geriatrician. According to Kernisan, it’s a good idea to share changes in ADLs or IADLs with your loved one’s medical team. Often, a change in a senior’s ability to perform them requires evaluations that may uncover a medical issue. This can help doctors identify the root cause of the problem or change in ability.\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSESSING ADLS\n\nIf someone is concerned about their mom, then knowing how they’re doing with ADLs is important. It can educate a person and take them from feeling like ‘Mom needs help, I’m worried,’ to be able to answer questions like, ‘OK, where does she need help?’\n\nUnderstanding the root cause can help your doctor identify ways to improve function, including medical treatment, mobility devices, and various therapies. A deeper understanding of your loved one’s ability to perform ADLs and IADLs can also help doctors create an accurate care plan that supports their needs.\n\nLet our care assessment guide you\n\nOur free tool provides options, advice, and next steps based on your unique situation.\n\nUse our ADL checklists to monitor your loved one\n\nTo help you assess and monitor your loved one’s activities of daily living, use A Place for Mom’s ADL and IADL checklists. After assessing your loved one, consider taking the results with you the next time your loved one has a medical checkup.\n\nClick on the respective images below to download the ADL and IADL checklists.\n\nTips for assessing your loved one’s ADLS and IADLs\n\nAs you assess your loved one’s ability to complete ADLs and IADLs, follow these tips:\n\nAsk for other opinions. Check with your loved one’s neighbors, family, and friends. Inquire about any changes in your loved one’s abilities. Pick two or three people to discuss your concerns with.\n\nAssess on a spectrum. Ask yourself whether your loved one can do the task a little bit, sometimes, or often rather than a simple “yes, they can do the task,” or “no, they can’t.”\n\nBe patient with slow activities. “If a person is doing a task more slowly than they used to, it doesn’t mean they can’t do the task,” Kernisan notes.\n\nConsider the time of day and how tired they are. Many seniors have sharper cognitive abilities and more energy in the morning.\n\nConsider their health. If they’re fatigued or fighting a virus, your loved one’s abilities can be momentarily impaired.\n\nFind the time. “It’s common to be in a hurry, and it’s difficult to find the time to observe, but it’s important to take the time, and when you do, be patient,” Kernisan says.\n\nLook at your own preconceived notions about your loved one. Are they interfering with your ability to make an objective assessment?\n\nMake the effort to help correct what you can. Ensure your loved one can live life to the best of their abilities and as independently as possible.\n\n“It’s very challenging to have people see you as less able,” Kernisan says. Family caregivers should “be discreet and empathetic” when assessing for ADLs and IADLs, she suggests.\n\nIf your loved one is unable to independently perform daily ADLs and IADLs, or if you have other safety concerns, it may be time to discuss senior care. Increasing support with home care or moving to an assisted living community can help them to live safely and continue their activities with assistance.\n\nTalk with a Senior Living Advisor\n\nOur advisors help 300,000 families each year find the right senior care for their loved ones.\n\nNext steps: Determining level of care\n\nAfter you’ve performed ADLs and IADLs assessments, you can begin to think about what level of care your loved one needs. For instance, the level of care needed by someone who can’t complete IADLs is different from the care needed by someone who can’t complete basic ADLs.\n\nQuestions to help you identify your loved one’s level of care\n\nThe following questions can help you assess your parent’s current needs and routine to identify potential care options:\n\nDo you or a neighbor need to check on your aging parent routinely?\n\nDoes your aging loved one need physical, occupational, or speech therapy?\n\nIs your aging parent able to continue living independently?\n\nWould senior care options eliminate chores and tasks that frustrate or are beyond your loved one’s ability?\n\nAs you track your loved one’s status and plan for future steps, keep in mind that ADL assistance requires more intensive, hands-on care than IADL assistance. In some cases, IADL deficiencies may be managed by different service providers, like a meal delivery service, a housekeeper, or an accountant. If in-home care services aren’t enough to help your parent complete all their ADLs, assisted living communities offer full ADL support for seniors.\n\nHow senior living can help with ADLs\n\nIf you’re worried about your loved one’s ability to perform everyday tasks, connect with their doctor to discuss your concerns. It’s important to identify any limitations your aging parent may have, but it’s even more critical to support them by finding solutions to help solve or alleviate those limitations. If your loved one needs help with even one ADL, assisted living or home care services could be helpful possibilities to consider.\n\nBy definition, assisted living communities offer residents assistance with ADLs and some IADLs. Here are some specific ADLs and IADLs that assisted living communities within A Place for Mom’s network help with:[06]\n\nOver 95% of communities provide meals.\n\nNearly 88% of communities offer incontinence care.\n\nAlmost 83% of communities offer medication management services.\n\nOver 80% of communities offer housekeeping services.\n\nAbout 77% of communities offer laundry or dry-cleaning services.\n\nOver 85% of communities offer transportation services.\n\nIf you’re ready to explore senior support options, reach out to one of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors. At no cost to your family, an advisor will work to understand your parent’s unique situation and needs, compare different senior living options, and offer personalized referrals.",
      "# [Questions to Ask Assisted Living Facilities When Touring by Rebecca Schier-Akamelu on 2024-07-29](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/choosing-the-right-assisted-living-facility)\nKey Takeaways\n\nTours are an ideal time to ask questions as you’ll have many staff members to talk to.\n\nPlan to ask about many topics during your tour, including care needs and pricing.\n\nTrack answers for each community you tour to help you compare them later.\n\nStaff may have questions for you, which is a good sign that they’re doing their best to make sure this is a good fit.\n\nAsk questions during assisted living tours to find a good fit\n\nHaving questions ready can help ensure your loved one’s care needs and personal lifestyle preferences will be met in their new assisted living community. Knowing what to look for before moving in can help avoid future dissatisfaction, which could ultimately result in another move for your loved one.\n\nAsk assisted living facilities about these topics during a tour\n\nYour questions during a tour should cover the following topics:\n\nPricing\n\nFloor plans\n\nAmenities and services\n\nProgramming and activities\n\nLevels of care\n\nCaregiver training\n\nStaff friendliness\n\nStaff-to-resident ratio\n\nCommunity culture\n\nSpeak with department heads and more\n\nAny staff member leading the tour should be able to answer any questions or direct you to another staff member who can. Some communities have designated tour guides while others may have the community director or a caregiver conduct tours. Note that the staff you will have access to during a tour will vary from community to community.\n\nRachel Levy has helped many families through the touring process. Before joining A Place for Mom, she gained 20 years of experience in management roles and as a sales director in senior living communities.\n\n“You want to make sure you’re speaking to as many department heads as possible,” Levy recommends. “They’re the ones day in and day out who will oversee your loved one’s care. If your sales director [or other tour guide] doesn’t do this automatically, then you need to ask. Key positions to speak to are the executive director and nursing director, but the maintenance and food service director can also add insights.”\n\nThe more people you talk to, the better view of a facility you’ll have. Ask your tour guide who will be available to speak with. You can even try asking if you can talk to a current resident about their experience.\n\nIs assisted living the right fit?\n\nLet our free assessment guide you to the best senior living options, tailored to your needs.\n\nAsk assisted living facilities these critical questions\n\nBelow, we’ve categorized several questions for assisted living interviews into lists to help you get all the necessary answers. As you navigate assisted living options, remember that every question is worth asking, even if you feel like it’s naïve or too specific. All details matter when choosing an assisted living facility for a loved one.\n\n“I welcomed all questions since most of the time it was the first time a family experienced senior living,” Levy says.\n\nWhat measures are taken to foster a safe, clean, and comfortable environment?\n\nIt’s important to learn how a facility maintains cleanliness, stays up-to-date on regulations, and ensures safety standards are always met. To get the specifics on how facilities foster a safe environment, try asking the following questions:\n\nWhat are the safety features (e.g., handrails, grab bars, and zero-threshold showers) throughout the community?\n\nWhat accessibility features (e.g., elevators, widened doors, stair lifts, and wheelchair ramps) are located throughout the community?\n\nAre all exits clearly marked?\n\nIs the common area décor intentional? Does it promote comfort and nostalgia (e.g., uplifting colors, art, and comfortable furniture)?\n\nHow often are the common areas cleaned and the grounds maintained?\n\nDoes the facility undergo regular inspections? If so, by which departments (e.g., the state’s health or social services department), and what was the facility’s most recent rating?\n\nHow are caregivers trained and equipped to handle residents’ unique needs?\n\nAn inside look at the caregiver hiring, training, and assigning process can help you assess how personalized the care is and how caregivers there foster nurturing relationships. To help you get an idea of the facility’s caregiving staff, try asking the following:\n\nDo staff members make you feel welcome?

Levy encourages families to ask as many questions as they want about the care provided in the community and to be forthcoming with their loved one’s needs.\n\n“Don’t feel like you need to hold back details,” she says. “It’s really important to be honest since communities are not alike. It will only help a community to determine if your family member is a good fit.”\n\nHealth care questions could include the following:\n\nAre physical and health assessments performed on residents prior to admission?\n\nDoes each resident have a written plan of care? If so, how often is it updated?\n\nDoes the facility’s care assessment include the resident, their family, the facility staff, and the resident’s doctors?\n\nWhat’s the medication management policy? Is self-administration of medication allowed?\n\nAre there any additional care services or therapies available on-site to accommodate changing needs (e.g., hospice care, memory care, physical therapy, etc.)?\n\nAre caregivers or on-site health care professionals equipped to provide care for residents diagnosed with different medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, chronic arthritis, etc.)?\n\nWho coordinates home health care visits from nurses, doctors, physical therapists, etc., if needed?\n\nIs there a clear procedure for responding to a resident’s medical emergency?\n\nIs transportation offered to residents for doctor’s appointments? If so, is the transportation staff-coordinated and wheelchair-friendly? Are mobility escorts available?\n\nAre there any reasons that a resident might need to move to a higher level of care that wouldn’t be able to be managed by the community?\n\nWill they allow seniors who are already receiving hospice services to move in? Are there any limitations to working with seniors receiving hospice services?\n\nHow does the facility enable residents to lead active and engaging lifestyles?\n\nLearn how a facility helps residents stay physically, mentally, and socially active and involved within the community, so that you can be sure your loved one will have plenty of engaging options. Find out how an assisted living facility accommodates your loved one’s hobbies and interests by asking the following:\n\nAre residents happy or satisfied with their lifestyle? How do you measure resident satisfaction?\n\nDo residents have a voice? Can they suggest new activities, clubs, or events?\n\nAre residents actively encouraged to participate in activities?\n\nWhat types of activities are available to residents? How often do they occur? Is there a calendar of events?\n\nIs live entertainment provided? If so, what kind and how often?\n\nWhat amenities are there (e.g., media center, fitness center, spa, barber shop, etc.)?\n\nWhat common spaces are available (e.g., dining rooms, lounges, game rooms, event halls, etc.) to encourage gathering?\n\nWhat outdoor spaces (e.g., walking paths, secured courtyards, and gardens) does the community have?\n\nAre there any shared community animals, such as dogs, cats, birds, or fish?\n\nIs there a place where residents can do their own gardening, arts and crafts, or other personal hobbies?\n\nDoes the facility collaborate with the surrounding community for events (e.g., local libraries, parks and rec, colleges, etc.)?\n\nDo residents go on regular outings, or do volunteers come into the community?\n\nDoes the community offer any religious services on-site or transportation to services in the area? Does the community have any affiliations with a particular religion, like Catholic assisted living? Or is there a large group of residents who share a common religion on-site?\n\nOf course, the people who may give the best insights about community life are the residents themselves. If you see residents during your tour, either in passing or while sampling a meal, ask them about their experiences.\n\nRead more: Senior Living and Socialization: How Social Engagement in Communities Benefits Health\n\nFROM THE EXPERT: SEEING RESIDENTS ON TOUR\n\nMost of the time if residents are happy, they’ll even come and interrupt your tour to tell [you] how happy they are. As a former sales director, I’d always love it when residents did that.\n\nAssisted living questions? Get expert help\n\nTell us your care needs to receive personalized guidance from our advisors.\n\nWhat kind of dining services does the facility offer?\n\nTo address how your loved one’s dietary needs and tastes will be met, it’s important to ask about on-site dining services. Depending on a senior’s needs and preferences, you can try asking the following:\n\nHow many meals are provided per day, and are mealtimes set?\n\nDoes the menu change daily? Is the food prepared daily?\n\nCan meals be tailored to a resident’s specific dietary needs, restrictions, or special requests?\n\nAre residents permitted to keep or cook food in their apartments?\n\nCan you sample meals during a tour?\n\nAre special meals prepared for specific holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions?\n\nDoes the community provide snacks throughout the day? What kind?\n\nIs there a café for snacks, drinks, and treats?\n\nRead more:Dishing Up the Facts About Assisted Living Menus and Dining Options\n\nHow does the facility accommodate residents’ unique living preferences?\n\nEvery senior leads a unique lifestyle, and it’s important for communities to account for that in as many ways as possible. See how the community can accommodate your loved one’s living preferences by asking the following:\n\nWhat floor plans are available? What’s the monthly cost per layout type?\n\nDo residents have the option of a private or shared room?\n\nAre couples allowed to live together? If so, how do they accommodate elderly couples?\n\nAre furnishings provided? If so, what types?\n\nCan residents personalize and decorate their own units?\n\nDoes each unit have a private bathroom, or are the bathrooms shared?\n\nIs each unit and bathroom designed to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers?\n\nAre there in-unit kitchens or kitchenettes? Is there a refrigerator, sink, or other cooking appliances?\n\nDoes each unit have good natural lighting?\n\nIs temperature controllable? If not, how is it maintained to help ensure residents’ comfort?\n\nDoes each unit have a 24-hour emergency response system?\n\nIs housekeeping offered? If so, does it include linen or laundry service?\n\nAre pets allowed to live in-unit? If so, is there a weight or breed restriction?\n\nHow do costs and fees vary in the community?\n\nCost is perhaps one of the most important factors in choosing an assisted living facility. Be upfront with questions about monthly costs, additional fees, and financing options in order to avoid potential hidden fees or a future increase in costs. Levy encourages families not to shy away from the financial questions, as these can affect your loved one now and in the years to come.\n\n“Rents typically increase at a senior living community just like they do at apartment buildings. Don’t be afraid to ask about that,” she says.\n\nImportant cost- and finance-related questions include the following:\n\nIs a contractual agreement available that discloses all health care and supportive service fees, as well as admission and discharge fees?\n\nWhat are the policies for refunds and transfers?\n\nWhat are the billing and payment policies?\n\nAre all services included in the monthly fee?\n\nWhat services aren’t covered by baseline costs (e.g., housekeeping, medication management, transportation, etc.)? How much are extras?\n\nAre hygiene supplies included in the monthly price? If not, what’s the cost for such items (like incontinence items)?\n\nDoes rent increase on a yearly basis, or is a rent-lock program in place?\n\nIs there a requirement for renter’s insurance? If so, what must be included in a policy?\n\nDoes the community help coordinate with any public programs that may help cover the cost of care services to the resident (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, etc.)?\n\nIs there a process for dissatisfied residents to file complaints?\n\nIs there a process for a resident to appeal a care decision that affects them?\n\nAre there any pricing incentives or move-in specials available?\n\nQuestions should go both ways\n\nDuring a tour, it’s normal for your guide to ask you questions as well. In fact, it’s a good sign.\n\n“As a sales director, it was my job to help our customers open up. I’d really focus on [asking] open-ended questions like, ‘What worries you the most right now?’ or ‘What do you think will happen if you don’t make a decision?’” Levy recalls. “I found that families opened up if I told them from the start that I’d be asking a lot of questions since it will help me help them. I always listened for emotional words and then asked them to tell me more.”\n\nThe more questions your tour guide and others in the community ask your family, the better. It shows that they care about your loved one and want to help make sure that the community will be a good fit for them.\n\nPrepare to tour multiple assisted living communities\n\nWhen selecting the right community for your loved one, you’ll want to do everything you can to make sure you find the right fit. From location to budget and lifestyle, you’ll have many factors to consider.\n\nOf all the families we’ve helped at A Place for Mom, half were referred to between four and six communities.[01] (We refer families to partner communities that would be a good fit for their loved one.) In order to keep the communities clear in your mind, Levy recommends spacing out tours.\n\nShe also recommends keeping in touch with any communities you tour.\n\n“It’s typical that a community will follow up with you after a,tour. I encourage you to take their calls and give them honest feedback.” Levy recommends. If something didn’t feel right, let them know. If you need a second tour, ask for it. It’s a big decision, and the more interaction you have with a community, the more likely you’ll know what to expect when you move in.”\n\nKeep track of answers from your assisted living interviews with our checklist\n\nKeeping track of details can be tough. They can easily get jumbled among your thoughts or in your notes, especially when you’re visiting multiple assisted living communities.\n\nTo help you stay organized, we’ve compiled a handy checklist for assisted living facility tours (it’s the questions above in PDF format). You can print out multiple copies — one for each community you visit — to keep track of the answers across each tour. At the end of all the tours, you can compare and contrast your notes to help you and your loved one make an informed decision.\n\nAnd, of course, you can always talk to a Senior Living Advisor at A Place for Mom. They’ll work with you to help find communities that fit your loved one’s lifestyle and budget. Plus they can help schedule tours for you. They’re a wonderful resource and offer advice as you navigate assisted living solutions near you, all at no cost to you.\n\nOriginal article by A Place for Mom senior copywriter Nirali Desai.\n\nWhat families are saying about assisted living facilities\n\nAssisted living reviews from residents and families\n\nLorien Harmony Hall\n\n5.0\n\nGreat for each category.
