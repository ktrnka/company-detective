We may also ask to see copies of driver’s licenses or other identifying material as part of the verification process.\n\nEmployee Cards may only be created for individuals of whom the business entity has validated the identity, using commercially acceptable screening methods such as employment screening and background checks and from whom business entity has acceptable documentation on file for the validation of the employee cardholder’s identity.

Has a tendency to constantly log you out. The app also suddenly leaves an expense for the home page.

      "# Slow and glitchy, 1 stars [(Akabat, Apple App Store, 2024-08-11)](https://apple/11599033802)\nMy employer utilizes CenterCard for company credit cards. It’s by far the worst credit card expense app I’ve ever used. It is very slow and glitchy. It often takes me 5+ minutes per expense. It frequently has errors uploading images. It takes 5-10 seconds to navigate to a different screen. (Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. I’m hopeful they will improve the app 🤞",

(Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. I’m hopeful they will improve the app 🤞",

Some of my favorite parts about Center are:\n-The bi-weekly sprint reviews, where the whole company gets a demo of what the engineering team has been working on. \n-The all-hands where the ELT is open and honest about recent performance and the plan moving forward\n-The tight-knit teams that have handled a year of remote work with resiliency and compassion.\n\nOur CEO is genuine and empathetic. If you need something, you pick up the phone and call him. Center is not a hierarchical place with lots of fiefdoms. \n\nThe best part, though, is that customers absolutely love our product. The customer is always at the forefront, and the entire team is focused on delivering tremendous value to customers.",

Having Steve's backing and professional network is a major asset for a startup,  and opens a lot of doors with prospective partners and customers.  He is also known for treating his employees very well over a long period of time - people who worked for him 20 years ago will drop everything to work with him again.  That has created a culture of trust and teamwork, and very low turnover among our young team - despite the inevitable twists and risks that an early startup faces.\r\n\r\nThe product vision and business model is innovative and fills a very clear niche in the market.   The CEO is visionary, thoughtful, respectful and an incredibly fast learner.  \r\n\r\nThe physical location is great:  in the middle of downtown Bellevue, with free parking.  (The tradeoff is that the building is long in the tooth, but everyone agrees it's worth it until we grow out of it.)\r\n\r\nSalaries are competitive, equity opportunities are promising, and benefits are solid.  The leadership team is staffed with industry veterans who bring external credibility and internal stability.   The engineering team has some amazing expertise.  Two-week sprint cycles set a vigorous but achievable development pace.",

That has created a culture of trust and teamwork, and very low turnover among our young team - despite the inevitable twists and risks that an early startup faces.\r\n\r\nThe product vision and business model is innovative and fills a very clear niche in the market.   The CEO is visionary, thoughtful, respectful and an incredibly fast learner.  \r\n\r\nThe physical location is great:  in the middle of downtown Bellevue, with free parking.  (The tradeoff is that the building is long in the tooth, but everyone agrees it's worth it until we grow out of it.)\r\n\r\nSalaries are competitive, equity opportunities are promising, and benefits are solid.

If you need something, you pick up the phone and call him. Center is not a hierarchical place with lots of fiefdoms. \n\nThe best part, though, is that customers absolutely love our product.

You and we agree that upon the election of either of us, any claims or disputes (as defined below) will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court (except for matters in small claims court). This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”). BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENT TRIBUNAL, AND YOU AND WE ARE ALSO WAIVING ANY ABILITY TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION.

Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future. All such claims or disputes are referred to in this section as “Claims.” The only exception to arbitration of Claims is that both you and we have the right to pursue a Claim in a small claims court instead of arbitration, if the Claim is in that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis.\n\n12.4.2.3 Arbitral Forum and Rules. You agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator who is an attorney and who is knowledgeable and experienced in matters of credit card-related services appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) upon demand by any party to these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Such arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with JAMS rules and procedures, unless otherwise provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\n12.4.2.4 Fees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law.

Such action plan may include, if commercially reasonable, modifications to the Program. Company also agrees to cooperate should Center receive a communication from a governmental authority regarding the Program.\n\n12.8 Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n12.9 Severability. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\n\n12.10 Compliance with Laws.

From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account.

This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges. For international transactions, the transaction amount includes a MasterCard cross-border fee (currently 90 basis points) and a MasterCard currency conversion assessment fee (currently 20 basis points), which are subject to change in MasterCard’s sole discretion.\n\n(a) Late Fee and Default Interest. If Customer does not make full payment of the Total Amount Due on the due date, then Customer shall pay a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $150 or (ii) 9.99% of the past due portion of the Total Amount Due (excluding any previous late fees and any default interest charges). In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date. In no event will the default interest rate exceed the greater of 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no late fee or default interest charge will be applicable if the unpaid amount on the Account is less than $75.\n\n(c) Returned Payment. Comdata reserves the right to charge a returned payment fee of twenty dollars ($20) or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is less.\n\n7. Statements; Reporting.

After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible.
