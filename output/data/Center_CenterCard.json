Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future. All such claims or disputes are referred to in this section as “Claims.” The only exception to arbitration of Claims is that both you and we have the right to pursue a Claim in a small claims court instead of arbitration, if the Claim is in that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis.\n\n12.4.2.3 Arbitral Forum and Rules. You agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator who is an attorney and who is knowledgeable and experienced in matters of credit card-related services appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) upon demand by any party to these Terms and Conditions and in accordance with JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Such arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with JAMS rules and procedures, unless otherwise provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\n12.4.2.4 Fees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law.

Such action plan may include, if commercially reasonable, modifications to the Program.

The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n12.9 Severability. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\n\n12.10 Compliance with Laws.

Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms of Use for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\nFees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law.

If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific part shall be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.5 Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.7 Compliance with Laws.

Integration Partner; Authorization. Customer has entered into a separate agreement with Center ID Corp. (“Integration Partner”) pursuant to which Integration Partner provides Account management services to Customer. In connection with such agreement with Integration Partner and this Agreement, Customer authorizes Comdata to provide Integration Partner with (i) access to Customer’s Account, including certain administrative functions, and (ii) Customer’s transaction data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Comdata shall have no liability for any actions of Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s) and Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Comdata from any damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs) arising out of or in connection with any action by Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s).\n\n4. Credit Limit; Credit Information. If applicable, Comdata will establish a credit limit for the Account. The credit limit is subject to periodic review and adjustment by Comdata in its sole discretion. Customer shall provide Comdata with such financial information as Comdata may reasonably require, including, without limitation, annual financial statements within a reasonable time after Customer’s fiscal year-end and interim financial statements as requested by Comdata. Customer authorizes Comdata to make any credit investigation Comdata deems necessary and appropriate and to request reports from credit bureaus in connection with this Agreement or any update, renewal or extension of credit.\n\nComdata may furnish information with respect to Customer’s Account to credit bureaus or others who may properly receive such information. Customer shall repay Comdata for all credit extended by Comdata and shall not allow its unpaid balance, including unbilled transactions, fees and other charges on the Account, to exceed its credit limit at any time. If Customer exceeds its credit limit, then Comdata may require immediate payment, suspend further Service, and assess additional fees.\n\n5. Security. From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account. This is not a revolving credit account and the total amount shown on each Account statement (the “Total Amount Due”) is due and payable by the date shown on the Account statement. This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges. For international transactions, the transaction amount includes a MasterCard cross-border fee (currently 90 basis points) and a MasterCard currency conversion assessment fee (currently 20 basis points), which are subject to change in MasterCard’s sole discretion.\n\n(a) Late Fee and Default Interest. If Customer does not make full payment of the Total Amount Due on the due date, then Customer shall pay a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $150 or (ii) 9.99% of the past due portion of the Total Amount Due (excluding any previous late fees and any default interest charges). In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date. In no event will the default interest rate exceed the greater of 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no late fee or default interest charge will be applicable if the unpaid amount on the Account is less than $75.\n\n(c) Returned Payment. Comdata reserves the right to charge a returned payment fee of twenty dollars ($20) or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is less.\n\n7. Statements; Reporting. Billing statements and reports are available on-line. Customer understands and agrees that Comdata’s ability to provide complete reporting information to Customer (or Integration Partner) is dependent on merchant providing complete purchase detail to Comdata.\n\n8. Term; Termination. This Agreement is for an initial term of one (1) year, commencing on the date this Agreement is executed by Comdata. After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. Disputed Items. Comdata must be notified by Customer or Customer’s representative in writing of any disputed item on Customer’s billing statement within sixty (60) days from the date of the billing statement, or it will be deemed undisputed and accepted by Customer. Unless required by law, Comdata is not responsible for any problem Customer may have with any goods or services charged on the Account. If Customer has a dispute with a merchant, Customer must pay Comdata and attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to sending the dispute to Comdata. If Customer is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute directly with the merchant, Comdata will attempt to process the dispute through MasterCard subject to the MasterCard rules, as they may be changed from time to time in MasterCard’s sole discretion. Comdata is not responsible if any merchant refuses to honor C",

      "# [USA PATRIOT Act on 2023-03-30](https://getcenter.com/USAPATRIOTAct)\nLast updated 8/19/19\n\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each business who opens an account and the personal information of its owners and/or authorized representatives. In opening a Center account this means that in addition to information about the business entity, we will also ask for identifying information about the business owner and any other individuals associated with the account. Such information will include the name, address, date of birth, social security number, tax status and other information that will allow appropriate identification to be made. We may also ask to see copies of driver’s licenses or other identifying material as part of the verification process.\n\nEmployee Cards may only be created for individuals of whom the business entity has validated the identity, using commercially acceptable screening methods such as employment screening and background checks and from whom business entity has acceptable documentation on file for the validation of the employee cardholder’s identity. Center reserves the right to request information and/or documentation to validate any employee cardholder’s identity if necessary and to close any employee cardholder’s Card if the cardholder’s identity cannot be validated and/or if issuing a Card to any individual may be a violation of the USA PATRIOT Act or any other applicable law."

Has a tendency to constantly log you out. The app also suddenly leaves an expense for the home page.

It’s by far the worst credit card expense app I’ve ever used. It is very slow and glitchy. It often takes me 5+ minutes per expense. It frequently has errors uploading images. It takes 5-10 seconds to navigate to a different screen. (Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. I’m hopeful they will improve the app 🤞",

(Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in.

I was asked to increase the number of meetings, by almost 50%, even though my peers were asked to do 50% less. \nI was given Hawaii and the Dakotas as my territories; states with significantly smaller populations and less business per capita- making my PIP even harder to attain. \nAfter the month ended, I was in the top 80% of my 20 person cohort; despite the majority of my peers underperforming, I was still fired. \nI'm not sure what other departments are like, but if you are headed into sales at Center I would highly advise against it.",

The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party.

These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.\n\n9.4.2 Claims Subject to Arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach, termination or validity of the Agreement will be submitted to arbitration as prescribed herein. Any arbitration related to the Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.4.1 above.\n\nYou and we agree that upon the election of either of us, any claims or disputes (as defined below) will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court (except for matters in small claims court). This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”). YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENT TRIBUNAL, AND YOU AND WE ARE ALSO WAIVING ANY ABILITY TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION. ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS STATED BELOW, MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION WHEN EITHER YOU OR WE REQUEST IT.\n\nWhat claims or disputes are subject to arbitration? Claims or disputes between you and us about your deposit account, transactions involving your deposit account, and any related service or agreement with us are subject to arbitration. Any claims or disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, any prior account agreement between us, or the advertising, the application for, or the denial, approval or establishment of your account are included. Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future. All such claims or disputes are referred to in this section as “Claims.” The only exception to arbitration of Claims is that both you and we have the right to pursue a Claim in a small claims court instead of arbitration, if the Claim is in that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis.\n\nWhat arbitral forum and rules will govern the arbitration? You agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator who is an attorney and who is knowledgeable and experienced in matters of credit card-related services appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) upon demand by any party to these Terms of Use and in accordance with JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Such arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with JAMS rules and procedures, unless otherwise provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms of Use for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\nFees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.\n\nCan I (customer) cancel or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate? You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate if you tell us within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Card. Requests to opt out of this agreement that are made more than thirty (30) days after your first use of a Card are invalid. If you want to opt out, call email us at legalnotices@getcenter.com. Otherwise this agreement to arbitrate will apply without limitation, regardless of whether 1) your Card account is closed; 2) you pay us in full any outstanding debt you owe; or 3) you file for bankruptcy. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate will not affect the other provisions of this agreement. If you validly opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, your decision to opt out will apply only to this arbitration agreement and not any other arbitration agreement.\n\n9.4.3 Survival, Conflict, Severance. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of any agreement you have with Center and any bankruptcy. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this arbitration provision, on the one hand, and the administrator’s rules or this Agreement, on the other hand, this arbitration provision will govern. If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific part shall be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.5 Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.7 Compliance with Laws. You agree to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, orders and regulations.\n\n9.8 Export Regulation. Certain Services or Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release those Services or Software to or make them accessible from any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule or regulation.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Center with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications and understandings, written or oral. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Cardholder Agreement, these Terms of Use will prevail with respect to your use of the Services and your Cardholder Agreement will prevail with respect to your Card and Card Transactions.\n\nCard Agreement\n\nComdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement\n\nThis Comdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement is made and entered into by and between Comdata Inc. (“Comdata”) and the Customer named in the Application relating to the establishment of MasterCard account(s) with Comdata pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Comdata will provide Customer with one or more accounts through the use of which Customer may access certain card networks (“Networks”), and the financial information and other services provided for in this Agreement and any Schedules attached hereto (collectively, the “Account”). In connection with the Account, Comdata, in accordance with Customer’s request, will provide special Comdata®MasterCard Corporate Cards®, which may include fleet, purchasing, T&E, multi cards and virtual cards (collectively, “Cards”), and which are issued by Regions Bank, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, or another financial institution (“Issuing Bank”).

All Cards issued to Customer shall remain the property of the Issuing Bank and must be returned or destroyed (with certification of destruction) upon request. Comdata or the Issuing Bank may cancel, revoke, repossess or restrict the use of Cards at any time.\n\n2. Customer Representations and Warranties.

Integration Partner; Authorization. Customer has entered into a separate agreement with Center ID Corp. (“Integration Partner”) pursuant to which Integration Partner provides Account management services to Customer. In connection with such agreement with Integration Partner and this Agreement, Customer authorizes Comdata to provide Integration Partner with (i) access to Customer’s Account, including certain administrative functions, and (ii) Customer’s transaction data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Comdata shall have no liability for any actions of Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s) and Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Comdata from any damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs) arising out of or in connection with any action by Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s).\n\n4. Credit Limit; Credit Information. If applicable, Comdata will establish a credit limit for the Account. The credit limit is subject to periodic review and adjustment by Comdata in its sole discretion. Customer shall provide Comdata with such financial information as Comdata may reasonably require, including, without limitation, annual financial statements within a reasonable time after Customer’s fiscal year-end and interim financial statements as requested by Comdata. Customer authorizes Comdata to make any credit investigation Comdata deems necessary and appropriate and to request reports from credit bureaus in connection with this Agreement or any update, renewal or extension of credit.\n\nComdata may furnish information with respect to Customer’s Account to credit bureaus or others who may properly receive such information. Customer shall repay Comdata for all credit extended by Comdata and shall not allow its unpaid balance, including unbilled transactions, fees and other charges on the Account, to exceed its credit limit at any time. If Customer exceeds its credit limit, then Comdata may require immediate payment, suspend further Service, and assess additional fees.\n\n5. Security. From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account. This is not a revolving credit account and the total amount shown on each Account statement (the “Total Amount Due”) is due and payable by the date shown on the Account statement. This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges. For international transactions, the transaction amount includes a MasterCard cross-border fee (currently 90 basis points) and a MasterCard currency conversion assessment fee (currently 20 basis points), which are subject to change in MasterCard’s sole discretion.\n\n(a) Late Fee and Default Interest. If Customer does not make full payment of the Total Amount Due on the due date, then Customer shall pay a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $150 or (ii) 9.99% of the past due portion of the Total Amount Due (excluding any previous late fees and any default interest charges). In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date. In no event will the default interest rate exceed the greater of 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no late fee or default interest charge will be applicable if the unpaid amount on the Account is less than $75.\n\n(c) Returned Payment. Comdata reserves the right to charge a returned payment fee of twenty dollars ($20) or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is less.\n\n7. Statements; Reporting. Billing statements and reports are available on-line. Customer understands and agrees that Comdata’s ability to provide complete reporting information to Customer (or Integration Partner) is dependent on merchant providing complete purchase detail to Comdata.\n\n8. Term; Termination. This Agreement is for an initial term of one (1) year, commencing on the date this Agreement is executed by Comdata. After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. Disputed Items. Comdata must be notified by Customer or Customer’s representative in writing of any disputed item on Customer’s billing statement within sixty (60) days from the date of the billing statement, or it will be deemed undisputed and accepted by Customer. Unless required by law, Comdata is not responsible for any problem Customer may have with any goods or services charged on the Account. If Customer has a dispute with a merchant, Customer must pay Comdata and attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to sending the dispute to Comdata. If Customer is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute directly with the merchant, Comdata will attempt to process the dispute through MasterCard subject to the MasterCard rules, as they may be changed from time to time in MasterCard’s sole discretion. Comdata is not responsible if any merchant refuses to honor C",
