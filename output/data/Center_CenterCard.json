Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party.

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach, termination or validity of the Agreement will be submitted to arbitration as prescribed herein. Any arbitration related to the Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.4.1 above.\n\nYou and we agree that upon the election of either of us, any claims or disputes (as defined below) will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court (except for matters in small claims court). This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”). YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENT TRIBUNAL, AND YOU AND WE ARE ALSO WAIVING ANY ABILITY TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION. ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS STATED BELOW, MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION WHEN EITHER YOU OR WE REQUEST IT.\n\nWhat claims or disputes are subject to arbitration? Claims or disputes between you and us about your deposit account, transactions involving your deposit account, and any related service or agreement with us are subject to arbitration. Any claims or disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, any prior account agreement between us, or the advertising, the application for, or the denial, approval or establishment of your account are included. Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future. All such claims or disputes are referred to in this section as “Claims.” The only exception to arbitration of Claims is that both you and we have the right to pursue a Claim in a small claims court instead of arbitration, if the Claim is in that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis.\n\nWhat arbitral forum and rules will govern the arbitration? You agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator who is an attorney and who is knowledgeable and experienced in matters of credit card-related services appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) upon demand by any party to these Terms of Use and in accordance with JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Such arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with JAMS rules and procedures, unless otherwise provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms of Use for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\nFees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.\n\nCan I (customer) cancel or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate? You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate if you tell us within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Card. Requests to opt out of this agreement that are made more than thirty (30) days after your first use of a Card are invalid. If you want to opt out, call email us at legalnotices@getcenter.com. Otherwise this agreement to arbitrate will apply without limitation, regardless of whether 1) your Card account is closed; 2) you pay us in full any outstanding debt you owe; or 3) you file for bankruptcy. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate will not affect the other provisions of this agreement. If you validly opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, your decision to opt out will apply only to this arbitration agreement and not any other arbitration agreement.\n\n9.4.3 Survival, Conflict, Severance. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of any agreement you have with Center and any bankruptcy. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this arbitration provision, on the one hand, and the administrator’s rules or this Agreement, on the other hand, this arbitration provision will govern. If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific part shall be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.5 Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.7 Compliance with Laws. You agree to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, orders and regulations.\n\n9.8 Export Regulation. Certain Services or Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release those Services or Software to or make them accessible from any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule or regulation.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Center with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications and understandings, written or oral. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Cardholder Agreement, these Terms of Use will prevail with respect to your use of the Services and your Cardholder Agreement will prevail with respect to your Card and Card Transactions.\n\nCard Agreement\n\nComdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement\n\nThis Comdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement is made and entered into by and between Comdata Inc. (“Comdata”) and the Customer named in the Application relating to the establishment of MasterCard account(s) with Comdata pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Nature of Account and Card Use. Comdata will provide Customer with one or more accounts through the use of which Customer may access certain card networks (“Networks”), and the financial information and other services provided for in this Agreement and any Schedules attached hereto (collectively, the “Account”). In connection with the Account, Comdata, in accordance with Customer’s request, will provide special Comdata®MasterCard Corporate Cards®, which may include fleet, purchasing, T&E, multi cards and virtual cards (collectively, “Cards”), and which are issued by Regions Bank, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, or another financial institution (“Issuing Bank”). Comdata is an agent or representative of Issuing Bank or its affiliates. All Cards issued to Customer shall remain the property of the Issuing Bank and must be returned or destroyed (with certification of destruction) upon request. Comdata or the Issuing Bank may cancel, revoke, repossess or restrict the use of Cards at any time.\n\n2. Customer Representations and Warranties. Customer represents and warrants the following:\n\nCustomer is either a governmental, non-profit or commercial enterprise, and the Account and Cards will not be used for personal, household or consumer purposes;\n\nthe Account and Cards will be used for legitimate business charges only and Customer will have neither consumer law rights nor remedies available to consumers associated with any purchases, charges or other activity associated with the Cards;\n\nthe Account and cards will only be used to make payments on behalf of Customer and will not be used to make payments on behalf of any third party;\n\nthe Account and Cards will only be used for valid and lawful purposes and will not be used for gambling, online gaming, illicit drug transactions, or any unlawful purposes including without limitation (i) other illegal purchases of goods or services, regardless of whether such transaction violates the laws applicable in the territory where the transaction was initiated or merchant is located, or (ii) purchases that are prohibited by local law; and\n\nthe Account and Cards will not be used in any way that would cause Comdata or Issuing Bank to violate applicable Law.\n\nIf Customer uses, or allows someone else to use, the Account or Cards in violation of the above representations and warranties, Customer shall be responsible for such use and may be required to reimburse Comdata, the Issuing Bank, and MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”) for all amounts or expenses either Comdata, the Issuing Bank or MasterCard pays as a result of such use.\n\n3. Integration Partner; Authorization. Customer has entered into a separate agreement with Center ID Corp. (“Integration Partner”) pursuant to which Integration Partner provides Account management services to Customer. In connection with such agreement with Integration Partner and this Agreement, Customer authorizes Comdata to provide Integration Partner with (i) access to Customer’s Account, including certain administrative functions, and (ii) Customer’s transaction data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Comdata shall have no liability for any actions of Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s) and Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Comdata from any damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs) arising out of or in connection with any action by Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s).\n\n4. Credit Limit; Credit Information. If applicable, Comdata will establish a credit limit for the Account. The credit limit is subject to periodic review and adjustment by Comdata in its sole discretion. Customer shall provide Comdata with such financial information as Comdata may reasonably require, including, without limitation, annual financial statements within a reasonable time after Customer’s fiscal year-end and interim financial statements as requested by Comdata. Customer authorizes Comdata to make any credit investigation Comdata deems necessary and appropriate and to request reports from credit bureaus in connection with this Agreement or any update, renewal or extension of credit.\n\nComdata may furnish information with respect to Customer’s Account to credit bureaus or others who may properly receive such information. Customer shall repay Comdata for all credit extended by Comdata and shall not allow its unpaid balance, including unbilled transactions, fees and other charges on the Account, to exceed its credit limit at any time. If Customer exceeds its credit limit, then Comdata may require immediate payment, suspend further Service, and assess additional fees.\n\n5. Security. From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account. This is not a revolving credit account and the total amount shown on each Account statement (the “Total Amount Due”) is due and payable by the date shown on the Account statement. This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges. For international transactions, the transaction amount includes a MasterCard cross-border fee (currently 90 basis points) and a MasterCard currency conversion assessment fee (currently 20 basis points), which are subject to change in MasterCard’s sole discretion.\n\n(a) Late Fee and Default Interest. If Customer does not make full payment of the Total Amount Due on the due date, then Customer shall pay a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $150 or (ii) 9.99% of the past due portion of the Total Amount Due (excluding any previous late fees and any default interest charges). In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date. In no event will the default interest rate exceed the greater of 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no late fee or default interest charge will be applicable if the unpaid amount on the Account is less than $75.\n\n(c) Returned Payment. Comdata reserves the right to charge a returned payment fee of twenty dollars ($20) or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is less.\n\n7. Statements; Reporting. Billing statements and reports are available on-line. Customer understands and agrees that Comdata’s ability to provide complete reporting information to Customer (or Integration Partner) is dependent on merchant providing complete purchase detail to Comdata.\n\n8. Term; Termination. This Agreement is for an initial term of one (1) year, commencing on the date this Agreement is executed by Comdata. After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. Disputed Items. Comdata must be notified by Customer or Customer’s representative in writing of any disputed item on Customer’s billing statement within sixty (60) days from the date of the billing statement, or it will be deemed undisputed and accepted by Customer. Unless required by law, Comdata is not responsible for any problem Customer may have with any goods or services charged on the Account. If Customer has a dispute with a merchant, Customer must pay Comdata and attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to sending the dispute to Comdata. If Customer is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute directly with the merchant, Comdata will attempt to process the dispute through MasterCard subject to the MasterCard rules, as they may be changed from time to time in MasterCard’s sole discretion. Comdata is not responsible if any merchant refuses to honor C",

If I use the corporate Amex our company automatically loads hotel, rental car, and airline receipts. Food under $75 requires no receipt, while large meals require names of people attending. So I only need to load Uber receipts and I’m done. \n\nBut even if I’m using my personal card to juice my UR points, that’s roughly 15 receipts that I send from my phone to computer and fill out the entry.

It's basically 1-5 min each morning and then 10 min to itemize a hotel folio each Thursday. After the first week of a project I am more or less operating in steady state as the last weeks expenses clear as the new ones are incurred. Very good for keeping cash flow smooth as well.\n\nThe people who purport to take forever are probably putting off expenses for a month; then they have to untangle the mess, remember what everything was, and batch process it. Lots of inefficiencies there.\n\n## Comment ID ev9iadi with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/ev9iadi/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID evaqswv with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evaqswv/) (in reply to ID ev9iadi):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID evargbq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evargbq/) (in reply to ID evaqswv):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID evdan3c with +2 score by [(Dwnrbnsn, Reddit, 2019-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evdan3c/) (in reply to ID ev9iadi):\nYassss...\n\n### Comment ID evcxzy8 with +1 score by [(Corporate-Asset-6375, Reddit, 2019-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evcxzy8/) (in reply to ID ev9iadi):\nOh god you poor soul.

Email forward your receipts to a mailbox you link up to your account, photograph your paper receipts with the app on your phone and you're about done. Takes me about 15mins a week tops for flights, hotels, fuel, ubers, car rentals, mileage, and all that jazz. It's pretty easy, even for multiple reports/clients.\n\n## Comment ID ev9fera with +2 score by [(Corporate-Asset-6375, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/ev9fera/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\nThat seems absurd. Are you guys using any type of expense management software? If so, you have an wildly inefficient process somewhere.\n\nI spend a ~2 hours a month on expenses and that’s only because the project I’m on requires every single receipt, regardless of amount. On previous projects I could bang out a weekly expense report in 10 minutes (with concur).\n\n## Comment ID ev9hr98 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/ev9hr98/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID eva7ck9 with +1 score by [(nocertaintyattached, Reddit, 2019-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/eva7ck9/) (in reply to ID ev9hr98):\nWhats that?\n\n## Comment ID evbah29 with +1 score by [(Guy5145, Reddit, 2019-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evbah29/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\nI’ll say Abacus as an alternative to Expensify.\n\n## Comment ID evtey5a with +1 score by [(TheRealWatson88, Reddit, 2019-08-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/evtey5a/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\nCheck out Innate Software - [https://www.innatesoftware.io](https://www.innatesoftware.io/) .\n\nHaving been in consulting or sales my entire life I have always incurred a lot of business expenses and dreaded doing them. Eventually, I had enough and decided to create an expense management tool that is actually easy to use. We are helping reduce time spent managing expenses through 3 ways:\n\n1. Managing Expenses on the fly\n   1. Simply snap a picture of the receipt, text it into to us and we'll handle the rest.\n   2. We'll extract all the key information (Date, amount, vendor name, etc) from the receipt. Furthermore, if you have a credit card transactions being pulled in we'll automatically match up the receipt & credit card transaction (we integrate with pretty much every bank in the US and all large banks internationally)\n2. Grouping expenses into Trips\n   1. Typically when traveling for work, you have to fill out the same fields (i.e. expense code, why you were there, location, etc) for every single expense incurred on that trip. It super repetitive and tedious\n   2. We have created a notion of a trip, where you input those key fields once and we'll automatically populate for every expense incurred during that date range. Furthermore, if you submit a receipt for, say, flights to SFO on a Monday and return flights from SFO on a Thursday, we'll automatically create that Trip for you (and start associating expenses with it)\n3. Calendar view to visualize all your expenses.\n   1. Most people tend to drive their workday off their calendar so we figured why shouldn't it be the bases of how you manage your expenses. Using a calendar view makes it significant easier to retrace your trips (I was in city XYZ for customer ABC), see what expenses need your attention and which haven't been submitted. Allowing to you reduce the time spent managing your expenses and giving you more time to just about anything else.\n\n## Comment ID kxubisi with +1 score by [(KarrySodhi007, Reddit, 2024-04-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/kxubisi/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\nI personally use [Receipts Co](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1532569828) app, it has some cool features like\n- Tagging the receipts \n- Great customer support \n- Setting exchange rate for receipts I gather while travelling and setting home currency to generate reports later in one currency and I can set the exchange rate when I made the transaction \n- Excel export \n- Great search feature to reach the receipt photo when i need it quickly \n- Add receipts directly from photos app\n\n## Comment ID hxhwfdy with +1 score by [(Get_Center_Dot_Com, Reddit, 2022-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/citp4k/expense_management/hxhwfdy/) (in reply to ID citp4k):\nThis is an old post, and full transparency this is a Center representative responding. #ad.   \n\n\nIf you aren't familiar with Center, it's worth looking at.

Funds from the Series C round will be used to accelerate innovation, broaden distribution, and drive to profitability. The round comes on the heels of Center's integrated travel and expense launch, reinforcing the company's mission to transform spend management with a card-first approach, usage-based pricing model, and expanded product offerings. The business has continued to scale with +64% customer growth year-over-year.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of inflation and a rise in business travel, streamlining and controlling corporate spend remains a top priority for businesses. Center's card-first approach delivers complete visibility and control of employee spend, eliminating patchwork expense systems and enabling better management of decentralized purchasing. Center will leverage its infusion of capital to continue developing new features and capabilities that address customer pain points of rigid 'one-size-fits-all' expense management and integrated travel and expense solutions.\n\nOne key area of innovation will focus on creating an open platform targeted at both vertical software developers and financial institutions. The company will offer client libraries and APIs that enable third-parties to embed card and expense management features into existing workflows. Insights from EY show the value of intelligent integration, noting that organizations can lower payment processing costs and gain visibility through a consolidation of payment types. The use of purchasing cards (p-cards) and corporate cards provide more control over small spend amounts if data is captured within integrated environments, resulting in up to 17% cost savings in travel and expense categories.\n\n\"We are confident that how a payments platform integrates with other software packages will not only become a top priority for customers across industries but will also evolve into the most crucial payments differentiator,\" said Naveen Singh, CEO of Center. \"Opening up our platform and creating an ecosystem that can be deeply integrated, customized, and embedded natively inside of existing web and mobile applications provides value for the corporate customer, developer partners, and financial institutions alike. We see a fully integrated approach as the next frontier of innovation for expense management.\"\n\n\"Center's enriched tech portfolio underlines the company's vision of providing a seamless, end-to-end expense management experience from sales to deployment,\" said Garth Timoll, Managing Director at Top Tier Capital. \"As evidenced by continuous business momentum and customer growth, their card-first approach is redefining what effective expense management is for the modern era. We look forward to supporting their growth in this next phase.\"\n\n\"We believe in Center's vision of building a modernized expense management experience and are reiterating our commitment to this partnership with our additional investment,\" said Henry Ellenbogen, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Durable Capital Partners LP. \"Center's focus on expanding their tech stack and offering plug and play solutions increases value to existing customers and unlocks multiple entry points into the market, creating new opportunities to serve a broader range of customers.\"\n\nAbout Center\n\nCenter is a software company modernizing corporate card, travel, and employee expense management with one integrated solution.

      "# [Center Adds Travel to Card-First Expense Solution on 2023-10-17](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/center-adds-travel-to-card-first-expense-solution-301958640.html)\nMid-Market Companies Can Now Manage Corporate Cards, Travel, and Employee Expenses in One Place\n\nBELLEVUE, Wash., Oct. 17, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Center, a software company modernizing expense management, today announced the integration of travel into their core real-time expense solution. The new travel management experience includes travel booking, servicing, and support powered by Spotnana's cloud-based Travel-as-a-Service platform.\n\nTravel is typically the second highest business expense for companies behind payroll, and a historically difficult cost to control. Mastercard reports that upwards of 40% of travel spend leaks out of managed travel programs and into consumer tools, creating compliance issues and reconciliation complexity. Center's card-first experience, now with integrated travel, enables unified travel and expense policy management and real-time visibility into on and off-program travel spend.\n\n\"For any business seeking tighter control of the bottom line, a patchwork employee expense system does not address the tidal shift to decentralized purchasing patterns that have become dominant,\" said Naveen Singh, CEO of Center. \"Customers point to a lack of control and visibility, cumbersome processes, limited inventory, and high cost of ownership as pain points of current managed travel offerings. We're addressing that with an all-in-one travel and expense solution that streamlines the booking and expensing experience for employees, and enables complete visibility and control for finance teams.\"\n\nThe launch of Center's integrated travel and expense solution is in response to the frustration the company heard from customers who experience high levels of spend leakage and poor service from their existing products. Center's travel features solve these pain points by using Spotnana's modern travel infrastructure to provide the richest travel inventory on the market, self-service itinerary changes, and expert customer service, and reflects the company's commitment to providing the best card-first experience across all major corporate spend categories.\n\nCenter's expanded support for travel empowers mid-market finance and accounting managers to further streamline expense processing with an even broader set of capabilities, including the following:\n\nIntegrated Data & Policy – Universal travel and expense policy application enables every employee expense, including off-program travel bookings, to be run through corporate policies in real time, ensuring fast approvals and saving finance teams valuable time on month-end close.\n\nConsumer-Grade Booking Experience – Comprehensive, unbiased global travel inventory at competitive prices, self-service trip changes, automated redemption of unused ticket credits, and 24/7 access to expert travel agents allows travelers to book and manage trips more efficiently. Robust guest traveler support extends this experience to contractors or other non-employees.\n\nIncreased Automation & Intelligence – Booking receipts are automatically attached to corresponding expenses, improving expense categorization accuracy and helping enforce sound traveler buying behaviors.\n\nSingle Solution Deployment – Dedicated deployment managers with over 50 years of combined spend management experience ensure the seamless rollout of an integrated travel and expense solution. Designed to be self-service and backed by ongoing first-class support, Center is easily customized to a business' accounting practices and approval workflows with minimal customer lift.\n\nReimbursements and Virtual Cards – Full-featured solution includes the ability to manage reimbursements and safely issue unlimited physical and virtual cards, providing teams with end-to-end control over the travel and expense process.\n\nUsage-Based Pricing – Businesses only pay for what they use with no license, deployment, integration, or support fees.

      "# [Meet Center: Avenir’s Card-Centric Expense Tool on 2024-09-18](https://www.dt.com/resources/meet-center-avenirs-card-centric-expense-tool/)\nOrganizations of all sizes often struggle to effectively manage their expenses, and one of the pain points can be the company’s corporate travel program. Busy road warriors may submit their travel expenses late or forget to submit them at all. Out-of-policy purchases don’t always get flagged, which makes policy compliance a struggle. Industry-wide, many businesses could benefit from a holistic, reliable expense solution.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why we are introducing Avenir, our intuitive and connected experience for travel, expense, and meetings management. In Direct Travel’s recent blog series, I have answered some of your questions about Avenir and shared more about each of its key technology partners. First up was Spotnana and their Travel-as-a-Service platform. Next, we learned about TROOP’s meeting planning and group travel logistics.\n\nToday, we will see how Center’s complete, connected corporate card and expense management solution helps users gain real-time visibility, control, and flexibility all in one place.\n\nWhy Expense Management Must Evolve\n\nCenter recognizes that for much of our industry, the “traditional” spend management process is challenging. These are a sample of their findings from a recent survey of 200+ U.S. finance leaders:\n\nAlthough 46% have increased corporate card distribution to help control employee expenses, only 2% took the next step of adopting the necessary spend management software.\n\nNearly half said they had a major issue with the excessive time they were spending on expense reports.\n\n60% expressed a desire to replace their current systems with a solution that integrates travel, expense, and card management.\n\nMany found that their previous methods of managing spend were draining resources across the board. To help ease a variety of manual expense challenges, Center created an intelligent solution backed by their first-class level of service and support.\n\nHow Center Powers Smart Businesses\n\nCenter is reinventing expense management with a more configurable and extensible solution that takes a card-centric approach. It lets approvers see spend as it happens – turning every swipe into intelligence for better business decisions.\n\nThe CenterCard and connected software give businesses real-time visibility into all employee spending. Center automates traditional expensing and accounting tasks, modernizes travel booking, and provides finance teams with the controls and data needed for optimal decision making.\n\nCenter is easily customized to your accounting practices and approval workflows, and is delivered in a usage-based business model. It’s designed to be self-serve and is able to evolve as business needs change.\n\nHow Your Team Can Benefit from Center\n\nFrom efficient deployment to ongoing support, Center makes managing expenses easy regardless of your role in your organization:\n\nSpenders use the CenterCard and mobile app to submit receipts in real-time, eliminating the need for traditional batch-based expense reports. This means less time being frustrated by cumbersome processes and fumbling with outdated tech, and more time focusing on priorities.\n\nApprovers use the web app to efficiently authorize expenses. Center leverages automation and dynamic policies to streamline enforcement and drive better spending behavior. This saves time by identifying normal spending patterns and highlighting any spend that’s out of policy (including off-platform travel bookings). Additionally, approval routing is highly configurable, so approvers can route expenses by project, job, department, spend amount, or category.\n\nFinance teams normally spend multiple hours accounting for expenses and reconciling them to corporate card statements, but Center cuts this time down to minutes. They not only provide a real-time foundation for audits and approvals, but also for posting, reconciliation, and analyzing spend. This real-time visibility and maximum card control in one central location gives finance teams everything they need to manage all employee expenses (including travel!)\n\nBusiness Travelers Can Have The Perfect Trip\n\nFrom Center’s expense management, to TROOP’s group travel and meeting planning, and Spotnana’s infrastructure and “plumbing,” these leading providers all serve as the backbone of Avenir’s open platform. Plus, the beauty of building an open platform is that we will continue to welcome other innovators to join us in this pursuit of #ThePerfectTrip.",

      "# [Center builds T&E solution with travel infrastructure powered by Spotnana by Sarosh Waghmar on 2023-10-17](https://www.spotnana.com/blog/center-builds-te-solution-with-travel-infrastructure-powered-by-spotnana/)\nI like to say that Spotnana is building longer tables, not higher walls. This is my simple way of saying that Spotnana was designed from day one to be an open platform that anyone could embed in their product suite, build upon, and use to sell travel.\n\nToday I’m proud to share that Center, a software company modernizing corporate card and expense management, has added travel to their expense solution using Spotnana as the core infrastructure powering their travel capabilities. Center’s integration of T&E services enables centralized management of corporate cards, travel, and all employee expenses.\n\nThe benefits of partnering for travel sales\n\nCenter was an early believer in Spotnana, and they were quick to embrace the benefits of a deep partnership.\n\nBooking travel is something we’re all familiar with through consumer websites and mobile apps, and I sometimes find this leads product teams to underestimate the complexity that lies behind the scenes.\n\nIn truth, the sources for travel inventory are highly fragmented and often built on legacy technology that is difficult to integrate. Pulling together real-time inventory across GDSs, LCCs, NDC integrations, OTAs, and other content sources – and then displaying everything consistently with overlaid policies, negotiated rates, and fare rules in a matter of seconds – is just the first technical challenge to solve.\n\nIn addition, since corporate online booking tools have been around since the late 1990’s, corporate buyers expect a broad range of features at launch including support for self-service changes and cancellations, multi-passenger booking, guest booking, unused ticket management, policy management, approval workflows, traveler tracking, payment method controls, preferred suppliers, integrated real-time analytics, and more.\n\nServicing is another major area that is often overlooked. Spotnana not only provides a new modern infrastructure for booking travel, our Travel-as-a-Service platform includes an Agent Desktop with a full suite of tools that agents can use to provide assistance to travelers anywhere in the world. For Center we not only provide this technology, we also operate as a white labeled TMC and deliver 24/7 assistance to all of their customers via chat, email, and phone.\n\nTravel is so massive and complex that we’ve decided to make it our entire focus, so we can commit all of our energy to providing the world’s most advanced travel solution. We built our platform to be open and easy to embed in other products, so that others could avoid having to suffer the pain of building everything from scratch and struggling to compete in a mature space with an inferior offering.\n\nBy partnering with Spotnana, Center was able to seamlessly integrate world-class travel booking and servicing capabilities into their solution and avoid the cost and risk of developing something that takes deep knowledge and an army of engineers to build. As a result, Center could get to market quickly with an industry-leading offering.\n\nDelivering a seamlessly integrated T&E solution\n\nBuilding an open platform is something we embraced as a design principle from the very beginning. Our entire architecture is API-first and built with microservices and extensible data frameworks.\n\nEach component of our system has its own API, and our user interface is built on top of these APIs as a separate and distinct layer. This means that any company can use our underlying platform and build an entirely new user interface on top of the same APIs.\n\nTo provide our partners with maximum flexibility, we have also broken our user interface into embeddable components that can be quickly white labeled. We support a broad range of theming and styling capabilities across fonts, colors, logos, and more.\n\nOf course, embedding travel in another solution requires integration beyond the user interface. Our deep integration with Center includes:\n\nCorporate Card – we support CenterCard as a central, individual, and virtual payment method.\n\nExpenses – we seamlessly pass detailed travel booking data and itineraries to Center for automated expense report creation and reconciliation.\n\nGuest Booking – we support guest booking features that ensure non-employees, such as job candidates, event speakers, etc. can be quickly reimbursed for travel expenses.\n\nHR feed – we use Center’s HR feed as the single source of truth.\n\nProfiles – we merge profile data and expose a single profile configuration experience to users.\n\nPolicies – we present admins with a single user interface for configuring policies for travel and other expenses.\n\nAnalytics – we provide a data feed that allows Center to present integrated reporting across travel and expense, enabling them to report on a wide range of data elements including travel program leakage.\n\nThe depth and quality of our integration is evident in this quote from AMAROK, one of Center’s customers:\n\n“We chose to centralize our disparate corporate card program into one platform to give us greater visibility and control over employee spending. With Center, we were able to streamline expense workflows top to bottom, and integrated travel helped us improve policy compliance across all corporate travel spend. The solution is fast, intuitive and similar to the tools I use for personal travel, providing a full inventory of booking options. Center’s flexible, usage-based model helps us keep costs down by only paying for what we need.”\n\n– Gina Fryer, Vice President of Finance at AMAROK\n\nPartnering for success over the long term\n\nOur commitment to supporting our partners goes far beyond building an industry-leading travel platform. We recognize that we need to support the entire go-to-market motion.\n\nFor Center, we organized technical workshops to align on integration strategy and capture roadmap feedback, provided training to Center’s sales and customer success teams, trained our agents to service their customers, expanded our technical support team to help resolve technology inquiries, and assigned a Partner Customer Success Manager to support the ongoing needs of our partnership.\n\n“Spotnana has been an incredible partner. Their technology is easy to integrate, they deliver an exceptional experience for both travelers and admins, and their incredible pace of innovation is only accelerating. We are big believers in an open platform and its benefits to the market – it mirrors the way we build our payments and spend management tech. With Spotnana, we feel very well positioned to deliver increasing value to our customers and continue to scale our business.”\n\n– Naveen Singh, CEO of Center\n\nWe feel truly blessed to work with Naveen and the entire team at Center. They are building something remarkable that every business can benefit from, and we are grateful to be a part of the end-to-end solution that is helping them win new customers every day.",
      "# [Annual Trends Survey from Center Reveals Corporate Card Usage is Outpacing Software Adoption, Highlighting Need for Integrated Expense Management Solutions on 2024-01-30](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/annual-trends-survey-from-center-reveals-corporate-card-usage-is-outpacing-software-adoption-highlighting-need-for-integrated-expense-management-solutions-302047630.html)\n60% of SME Respondents Would Consider New Solutions, Citing Simplicity, Improved User Experience and Lower Cost as Drivers of Change\n\nBELLEVUE, Wash., Jan. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Center, a software company modernizing expense management, today released insights from its fifth annual Expense Management Trends Survey, gathering data from over 200 finance and accounting professionals nationwide. The survey revealed a dichotomy between corporate card usage and expense management software adoption. While nearly half of respondents (46%) report increased corporate card usage, only 2% have increased adoption of expense management software, creating compliance and visibility challenges for employees and finance teams. Other findings show perennial expense management pain points such as laborious month-end closes, minimal user support and policy confusion reemerging YoY amidst a dynamic work landscape and increase in corporate travel.\n\nCorporate Card Usage Increases While Adoption of Expense Management Software Lags Behind\n\nWhile SMEs continue to increase corporate card usage, data from Center's survey shows that adoption of expense management software remains nearly at a standstill. These findings suggest that without the increased use of software to support rising corporate card usage, employees and finance teams will continue to battle disjointed processes, labor intensive reporting, and manual reconciliation, thwarting productivity and output.\n\nUse of expense management software has lingered between 39-47% since 2021.\n\nRespondents report the top three expense management challenges in 2024 are:\n\nTime spent filling out expense reports (46%)\n\nExpense policy support/helping users understand and follow expense processes (43%)\n\nCredit card reconciliation (42%)\n\nThe average number of days reported to close the books was 14 days, up from last year.\n\nDecentralized Workforces and Business Travel Resurgence Reinforce Need For Visibility and Control\n\nThe work landscape in 2024 remains predominantly decentralized. Upwork reports that 32.6 million Americans will work remotely by 2025; a significant22% of the total workforce. Increased business travel adds another layer of complexity to expense management with GBTA forecasting that corporate travel is expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024. Dispersed workforces and corporate travel create ample opportunity for spend leakage without the proper policies and tools in place that track and control employee spend.\n\n40% of respondents report spending between $250K-1M on corporate travel, a 30% increase within this spend range YoY.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of respondents (91%) expect travel spend to stay the same or increase.\n\n64% of respondents report leakage, up from 57% last year.\n\nDisconnect Between Spend Behaviors and Expense Policies Create Compliance Challenges\n\nFindings revealed incongruence between the checks and balances of SME employee spend. While respondents observed more booking happening off platform, only 32% have introduced stricter policies as a result. With confusion around policy emerging as a major challenge in 2024, businesses are signaling a need for clearer processes and policies. Software that unifies travel and day-to-day expenses enables complete visibility by automating policy application. Guardrails ensure fast approvals and quick out-of-policy spend flags, providing finance teams with the controls and data needed for optimal decision making while also improving the employee experience.\n\nDespite awareness of the dynamic macro-environment, fewer companies surveyed report having a written, well-maintained policy (39%) than in previous years with that number decreasing 10% from two years ago.\n\nEmployee understanding (45%) and awareness (29%) continue to be the highest ranked hurdles in policy compliance.\n\nOne-third of respondents report an out of date policy and one-fifth (22%) report no policy in writing.\n\nThe State of Travel and Expense Management in 2024\n\nDownload the full 2024 Travel and Expense Management Trends report here.
