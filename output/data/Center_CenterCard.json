Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future.

The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\n12.4.2.4 Fees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law.

Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future.

Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms of Use for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\nFees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law.

If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific part shall be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.5 Waiver.

If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.7 Compliance with Laws.

Comdata is an agent or representative of Issuing Bank or its affiliates. All Cards issued to Customer shall remain the property of the Issuing Bank and must be returned or destroyed (with certification of destruction) upon request. Comdata or the Issuing Bank may cancel, revoke, repossess or restrict the use of Cards at any time.\n\n2. Customer Representations and Warranties.

Integration Partner; Authorization. Customer has entered into a separate agreement with Center ID Corp. (“Integration Partner”) pursuant to which Integration Partner provides Account management services to Customer. In connection with such agreement with Integration Partner and this Agreement, Customer authorizes Comdata to provide Integration Partner with (i) access to Customer’s Account, including certain administrative functions, and (ii) Customer’s transaction data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Comdata shall have no liability for any actions of Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s) and Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Comdata from any damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs) arising out of or in connection with any action by Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s).\n\n4. Credit Limit; Credit Information. If applicable, Comdata will establish a credit limit for the Account. The credit limit is subject to periodic review and adjustment by Comdata in its sole discretion. Customer shall provide Comdata with such financial information as Comdata may reasonably require, including, without limitation, annual financial statements within a reasonable time after Customer’s fiscal year-end and interim financial statements as requested by Comdata. Customer authorizes Comdata to make any credit investigation Comdata deems necessary and appropriate and to request reports from credit bureaus in connection with this Agreement or any update, renewal or extension of credit.\n\nComdata may furnish information with respect to Customer’s Account to credit bureaus or others who may properly receive such information. Customer shall repay Comdata for all credit extended by Comdata and shall not allow its unpaid balance, including unbilled transactions, fees and other charges on the Account, to exceed its credit limit at any time. If Customer exceeds its credit limit, then Comdata may require immediate payment, suspend further Service, and assess additional fees.\n\n5. Security. From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account. This is not a revolving credit account and the total amount shown on each Account statement (the “Total Amount Due”) is due and payable by the date shown on the Account statement. This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges. For international transactions, the transaction amount includes a MasterCard cross-border fee (currently 90 basis points) and a MasterCard currency conversion assessment fee (currently 20 basis points), which are subject to change in MasterCard’s sole discretion.\n\n(a) Late Fee and Default Interest. If Customer does not make full payment of the Total Amount Due on the due date, then Customer shall pay a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (i) $150 or (ii) 9.99% of the past due portion of the Total Amount Due (excluding any previous late fees and any default interest charges). In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date. In no event will the default interest rate exceed the greater of 8% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no late fee or default interest charge will be applicable if the unpaid amount on the Account is less than $75.\n\n(c) Returned Payment. Comdata reserves the right to charge a returned payment fee of twenty dollars ($20) or the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, whichever is less.\n\n7. Statements; Reporting. Billing statements and reports are available on-line. Customer understands and agrees that Comdata’s ability to provide complete reporting information to Customer (or Integration Partner) is dependent on merchant providing complete purchase detail to Comdata.\n\n8. Term; Termination. This Agreement is for an initial term of one (1) year, commencing on the date this Agreement is executed by Comdata. After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. Disputed Items. Comdata must be notified by Customer or Customer’s representative in writing of any disputed item on Customer’s billing statement within sixty (60) days from the date of the billing statement, or it will be deemed undisputed and accepted by Customer. Unless required by law, Comdata is not responsible for any problem Customer may have with any goods or services charged on the Account. If Customer has a dispute with a merchant, Customer must pay Comdata and attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to sending the dispute to Comdata. If Customer is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute directly with the merchant, Comdata will attempt to process the dispute through MasterCard subject to the MasterCard rules, as they may be changed from time to time in MasterCard’s sole discretion. Comdata is not responsible if any merchant refuses to honor C",

      "# Sit and spin, 1 stars [(Samoore627, Apple App Store, 2024-10-29)](https://apple/11890344525)\nRegardless of your internet speed you spend so much time watching the application spin and think. This slowness really comes into play when you have many receipts for a single day\n\nAlso when you enter a new business and hit save….it doesn’t actually save it, you must reenter it every time\n\nLast hope about some intuitive cursor placement to avoid unnecessary clicking",
      "# Update every day, 1 stars [(Jacob P......, Apple App Store, 2024-09-25)](https://apple/11762870824)\nThis app updates 5 times a week and logs you out more than that. Clunky and non intuitive",
      "# Frustrating app., 1 stars [(Chief Finance dudeeee, Apple App Store, 2024-09-03)](https://apple/11683495164)\nThe app is constantly refreshing/updating in the middle of filling out an expense. Has a tendency to constantly log you out. The app also suddenly leaves an expense for the home page.  It seems the app wants to constantly save every entry/input which causes an expense to take 3-4 times longer than it should. Save the expense when submitting not after every entry/input, so the user doesn’t have to wait for the app to update.",
      "# Slow and glitchy, 1 stars [(Akabat, Apple App Store, 2024-08-11)](https://apple/11599033802)\nMy employer utilizes CenterCard for company credit cards. It’s by far the worst credit card expense app I’ve ever used. It is very slow and glitchy. It often takes me 5+ minutes per expense. It frequently has errors uploading images. It takes 5-10 seconds to navigate to a different screen. (Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. I’m hopeful they will improve the app 🤞",
      "# Expense keeps closing out, 3 stars [(Ryro27, Apple App Store, 2024-07-11)](https://apple/11482385503)\nAny time I change to another tab and then come back to the center card tab on my phone, it closes out the expense I was working on. Also any time I copy a pdf or image and then paste to an expense it closes the expense. Please update these bugs so I don’t have to keep going back into each expense.",

The app will constantly kick me out, then when I try to get back in I get error messages saying contact administrator.  After closing the app about 5-7 times I can finally enter. The app has been updated and so has my phone. The issue is on centers end.",

That is very little for someone who makes several business stops in one day. Ease of use is also off, but overall a decent app.",

As soon as there’s a charge on my card, I get a notification on my phone. From there, one click, take a picture of my receipt, enter in a few items and I’m done no more having to aggregate receipts to submit a month end report. The app is easy and allows me to do that.",
      "# The next level, 5 stars [(E Wade, Apple App Store, 2022-06-10)](https://apple/8760206852)\nGreat pop up alerts, auto-populating expenses at time of transaction, learning expense fields, unlimited customizable fields, backend exports (data and receipts), and each update offers actual GOOD improvements and updates.

I’m not going into excel and populating spreadsheets and gathering receipts.\nI have my CenterCard loaded into many of my recurring charges so when I see that charge occur I’ll pull down the receipt and pop it into Center Expense or Center mobile app and press submit. Or if I’m on the road I’ll swipe, take a pic of the receipt, and press submit. \nIt’s the new way of doing expense reports and I love it.",

Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms and Conditions for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party.

Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the breach, termination or validity of the Agreement will be submitted to arbitration as prescribed herein. Any arbitration related to the Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.4.1 above.\n\nYou and we agree that upon the election of either of us, any claims or disputes (as defined below) will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below, and not through litigation in any court (except for matters in small claims court). This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”). YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENT TRIBUNAL, AND YOU AND WE ARE ALSO WAIVING ANY ABILITY TO ASSERT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, MASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION. ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT AS STATED BELOW, MUST BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION WHEN EITHER YOU OR WE REQUEST IT.\n\nWhat claims or disputes are subject to arbitration? Claims or disputes between you and us about your deposit account, transactions involving your deposit account, and any related service or agreement with us are subject to arbitration. Any claims or disputes arising from or relating to this agreement, any prior account agreement between us, or the advertising, the application for, or the denial, approval or establishment of your account are included. Claims or disputes are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist or may arise in the future. All such claims or disputes are referred to in this section as “Claims.” The only exception to arbitration of Claims is that both you and we have the right to pursue a Claim in a small claims court instead of arbitration, if the Claim is in that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis.\n\nWhat arbitral forum and rules will govern the arbitration? You agree to arbitration before a single arbitrator who is an attorney and who is knowledgeable and experienced in matters of credit card-related services appointed by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) upon demand by any party to these Terms of Use and in accordance with JAMS’ Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Such arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with JAMS rules and procedures, unless otherwise provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Bellevue, Washington except as otherwise required under the JAMS Rules or applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and award will be final and binding, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereon. Any duty to arbitrate under these Terms of Use will remain in effect and enforceable after termination of these Terms of Use for any reason. Because both parties to the Agreement have been represented by legal counsel, and the parties have had the opportunity to negotiate individual provisions of the Agreement, the arbitrator will not construe any ambiguity that may exist in the Agreement in favor of or against either party. For the purposes of enforcement of any award, the parties both irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State of Washington.\n\nFees. Each party shall pay its own arbitration fees in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.\n\nCan I (customer) cancel or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate? You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate if you tell us within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Card. Requests to opt out of this agreement that are made more than thirty (30) days after your first use of a Card are invalid. If you want to opt out, call email us at legalnotices@getcenter.com. Otherwise this agreement to arbitrate will apply without limitation, regardless of whether 1) your Card account is closed; 2) you pay us in full any outstanding debt you owe; or 3) you file for bankruptcy. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate will not affect the other provisions of this agreement. If you validly opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, your decision to opt out will apply only to this arbitration agreement and not any other arbitration agreement.\n\n9.4.3 Survival, Conflict, Severance. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of any agreement you have with Center and any bankruptcy. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this arbitration provision, on the one hand, and the administrator’s rules or this Agreement, on the other hand, this arbitration provision will govern. If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific part shall be severed, and the rest of this arbitration provision will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.5 Waiver. The failure by a party to exercise any rights hereunder will not operate to be deemed a waiver of such party’s right or any other right in the future.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any provision of these Terms of Use are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be deemed limited or omitted to the minimum extent necessary, and the balance of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\n\n9.7 Compliance with Laws. You agree to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, orders and regulations.\n\n9.8 Export Regulation. Certain Services or Software may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release those Services or Software to or make them accessible from any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule or regulation.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Center with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous proposals, communications and understandings, written or oral. In the event of a conflict between these Terms of Use and the Cardholder Agreement, these Terms of Use will prevail with respect to your use of the Services and your Cardholder Agreement will prevail with respect to your Card and Card Transactions.\n\nCard Agreement\n\nComdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement\n\nThis Comdata MasterCard Corporate Card® Agreement is made and entered into by and between Comdata Inc.

Integration Partner; Authorization. Customer has entered into a separate agreement with Center ID Corp. (“Integration Partner”) pursuant to which Integration Partner provides Account management services to Customer. In connection with such agreement with Integration Partner and this Agreement, Customer authorizes Comdata to provide Integration Partner with (i) access to Customer’s Account, including certain administrative functions, and (ii) Customer’s transaction data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Comdata shall have no liability for any actions of Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s) and Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Comdata from any damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs) arising out of or in connection with any action by Integration Partner with respect to the Account(s).\n\n4. Credit Limit; Credit Information. If applicable, Comdata will establish a credit limit for the Account. The credit limit is subject to periodic review and adjustment by Comdata in its sole discretion. Customer shall provide Comdata with such financial information as Comdata may reasonably require, including, without limitation, annual financial statements within a reasonable time after Customer’s fiscal year-end and interim financial statements as requested by Comdata. Customer authorizes Comdata to make any credit investigation Comdata deems necessary and appropriate and to request reports from credit bureaus in connection with this Agreement or any update, renewal or extension of credit.\n\nComdata may furnish information with respect to Customer’s Account to credit bureaus or others who may properly receive such information.

From time to time Comdata may request Customer to provide security for the performance when due of Customer’s obligations hereunder. Customer understands and agrees that it is under no obligation to provide Comdata with such security, but the refusal to provide security when requested may result in adverse credit determinations by Comdata. Any security provided shall be in the amount and form as required by Comdata in its reasonable discretion. The Account will not be available to Customer until such security is accepted by Comdata in its sole discretion.\n\n6. Payment Terms. (a) Non-Revolving. Customer shall be responsible for credit extended on the Account. This is not a revolving credit account and the total amount shown on each Account statement (the “Total Amount Due”) is due and payable by the date shown on the Account statement. This amount includes transactions posted since the last statement date, applicable account and service fees, amounts past due, late payment charges, charges for returned checks and other applicable charges.

In no event will such late charge exceed the lesser of $5,000 or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event the Total Amount Due is not paid by the due date, then Comdata may assess a default interest charge at a rate equal to the weekly average prime loan rate as published by the Federal Reserve plus 4% per annum. The default interest is assessed on the Total Amount Due (excluding any late fees and any previous default interest charges) for the period of time such amount remains unpaid beyond the due date.

Customer understands and agrees that Comdata’s ability to provide complete reporting information to Customer (or Integration Partner) is dependent on merchant providing complete purchase detail to Comdata.\n\n8. Term; Termination. This Agreement is for an initial term of one (1) year, commencing on the date this Agreement is executed by Comdata. After the initial term, this Agreement shall continue until one party provides the other party with thirty (30) days written notice of termination.\n\nComdata may immediately terminate this Agreement and the Account in the event the Network prohibits the Account, the Issuing Bank ceases to be a network member or the Issuing Bank ceases to be the Card issuer, provided that Comdata shall endeavor to provide Customer with advance notice of any such event. In the event of Customer’s breach or default under the credit limit and payment terms of this Agreement, Comdata shall have the right to immediately suspend the Account until such breach is cured. In the event such breach or default is not cured within a reasonable period of time, Comdata may thereafter terminate the Agreement. In the event of any other default under this Agreement by either party, the nondefaulting party shall provide the defaulting party written notice of the nature of the default. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of the default notice to cure the default, and if the default is not cured within such time period, then the non-defaulting party may thereafter terminate this Agreement with written notice. In addition to any other rights of termination, either party may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice with respect to any individual state or jurisdiction if the terminating party can demonstrate, with documentary support, that changes in applicable laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof will make the performance of such party’s obligations hereunder not commercially feasible. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination. The effective date of termination under the preceding sentence will be ninety (90) days from the date notice is delivered, or upon the effective date of the new law or regulation, whichever occurs sooner. Customer’s obligation to pay for all outstanding amounts incurred before the effective date of termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. Disputed Items. Comdata must be notified by Customer or Customer’s representative in writing of any disputed item on Customer’s billing statement within sixty (60) days from the date of the billing statement, or it will be deemed undisputed and accepted by Customer. Unless required by law, Comdata is not responsible for any problem Customer may have with any goods or services charged on the Account. If Customer has a dispute with a merchant, Customer must pay Comdata and attempt to resolve the dispute with the merchant prior to sending the dispute to Comdata. If Customer is unsuccessful in resolving the dispute directly with the merchant, Comdata will attempt to process the dispute through MasterCard subject to the MasterCard rules, as they may be changed from time to time in MasterCard’s sole discretion. Comdata is not responsible if any merchant refuses to honor C",

Funds from the Series C round will be used to accelerate innovation, broaden distribution, and drive to profitability. The round comes on the heels of Center's integrated travel and expense launch, reinforcing the company's mission to transform spend management with a card-first approach, usage-based pricing model, and expanded product offerings. The business has continued to scale with +64% customer growth year-over-year.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of inflation and a rise in business travel, streamlining and controlling corporate spend remains a top priority for businesses. Center's card-first approach delivers complete visibility and control of employee spend, eliminating patchwork expense systems and enabling better management of decentralized purchasing. Center will leverage its infusion of capital to continue developing new features and capabilities that address customer pain points of rigid 'one-size-fits-all' expense management and integrated travel and expense solutions.\n\nOne key area of innovation will focus on creating an open platform targeted at both vertical software developers and financial institutions. The company will offer client libraries and APIs that enable third-parties to embed card and expense management features into existing workflows. Insights from EY show the value of intelligent integration, noting that organizations can lower payment processing costs and gain visibility through a consolidation of payment types. The use of purchasing cards (p-cards) and corporate cards provide more control over small spend amounts if data is captured within integrated environments, resulting in up to 17% cost savings in travel and expense categories.\n\n\"We are confident that how a payments platform integrates with other software packages will not only become a top priority for customers across industries but will also evolve into the most crucial payments differentiator,\" said Naveen Singh, CEO of Center. \"Opening up our platform and creating an ecosystem that can be deeply integrated, customized, and embedded natively inside of existing web and mobile applications provides value for the corporate customer, developer partners, and financial institutions alike. We see a fully integrated approach as the next frontier of innovation for expense management.\"\n\n\"Center's enriched tech portfolio underlines the company's vision of providing a seamless, end-to-end expense management experience from sales to deployment,\" said Garth Timoll, Managing Director at Top Tier Capital. \"As evidenced by continuous business momentum and customer growth, their card-first approach is redefining what effective expense management is for the modern era. We look forward to supporting their growth in this next phase.\"\n\n\"We believe in Center's vision of building a modernized expense management experience and are reiterating our commitment to this partnership with our additional investment,\" said Henry Ellenbogen, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Durable Capital Partners LP. \"Center's focus on expanding their tech stack and offering plug and play solutions increases value to existing customers and unlocks multiple entry points into the market, creating new opportunities to serve a broader range of customers.\"\n\nAbout Center\n\nCenter is a software company modernizing corporate card, travel, and employee expense management with one integrated solution.

      "# [Annual Trends Survey from Center Reveals Corporate Card Usage is Outpacing Software Adoption, Highlighting Need for Integrated Expense Management Solutions on 2024-01-30](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/annual-trends-survey-from-center-reveals-corporate-card-usage-is-outpacing-software-adoption-highlighting-need-for-integrated-expense-management-solutions-302047630.html)\n60% of SME Respondents Would Consider New Solutions, Citing Simplicity, Improved User Experience and Lower Cost as Drivers of Change\n\nBELLEVUE, Wash., Jan. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Center, a software company modernizing expense management, today released insights from its fifth annual Expense Management Trends Survey, gathering data from over 200 finance and accounting professionals nationwide. The survey revealed a dichotomy between corporate card usage and expense management software adoption. While nearly half of respondents (46%) report increased corporate card usage, only 2% have increased adoption of expense management software, creating compliance and visibility challenges for employees and finance teams. Other findings show perennial expense management pain points such as laborious month-end closes, minimal user support and policy confusion reemerging YoY amidst a dynamic work landscape and increase in corporate travel.\n\nCorporate Card Usage Increases While Adoption of Expense Management Software Lags Behind\n\nWhile SMEs continue to increase corporate card usage, data from Center's survey shows that adoption of expense management software remains nearly at a standstill. These findings suggest that without the increased use of software to support rising corporate card usage, employees and finance teams will continue to battle disjointed processes, labor intensive reporting, and manual reconciliation, thwarting productivity and output.\n\nUse of expense management software has lingered between 39-47% since 2021.\n\nRespondents report the top three expense management challenges in 2024 are:\n\nTime spent filling out expense reports (46%)\n\nExpense policy support/helping users understand and follow expense processes (43%)\n\nCredit card reconciliation (42%)\n\nThe average number of days reported to close the books was 14 days, up from last year.\n\nDecentralized Workforces and Business Travel Resurgence Reinforce Need For Visibility and Control\n\nThe work landscape in 2024 remains predominantly decentralized. Upwork reports that 32.6 million Americans will work remotely by 2025; a significant22% of the total workforce. Increased business travel adds another layer of complexity to expense management with GBTA forecasting that corporate travel is expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024. Dispersed workforces and corporate travel create ample opportunity for spend leakage without the proper policies and tools in place that track and control employee spend.\n\n40% of respondents report spending between $250K-1M on corporate travel, a 30% increase within this spend range YoY.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of respondents (91%) expect travel spend to stay the same or increase.\n\n64% of respondents report leakage, up from 57% last year.\n\nDisconnect Between Spend Behaviors and Expense Policies Create Compliance Challenges\n\nFindings revealed incongruence between the checks and balances of SME employee spend. While respondents observed more booking happening off platform, only 32% have introduced stricter policies as a result. With confusion around policy emerging as a major challenge in 2024, businesses are signaling a need for clearer processes and policies. Software that unifies travel and day-to-day expenses enables complete visibility by automating policy application. Guardrails ensure fast approvals and quick out-of-policy spend flags, providing finance teams with the controls and data needed for optimal decision making while also improving the employee experience.\n\nDespite awareness of the dynamic macro-environment, fewer companies surveyed report having a written, well-maintained policy (39%) than in previous years with that number decreasing 10% from two years ago.\n\nEmployee understanding (45%) and awareness (29%) continue to be the highest ranked hurdles in policy compliance.\n\nOne-third of respondents report an out of date policy and one-fifth (22%) report no policy in writing.\n\nThe State of Travel and Expense Management in 2024\n\nDownload the full 2024 Travel and Expense Management Trends report here.

This new addition builds on the success of Center's recent integration of travel management into its card-led solution, which has seen strong year-over-year adoption, including a 2x increase in T&E customers and 50% growth in the company's overall customer base.\n\nIn managed travel, off-platform bookings and project-based expenditures are historically challenging costs to control. A 2024 Deloitte travel study found that nearly half (44%) of employees surveyed are aware of corporate booking channels and still book through unmanaged channels. Center's Insights for Travel hub addresses these pain points by being the first solution to unify all real-time travel spend data, including both on- and off-platform bookings, to provide customers with a comprehensive view of travel expenditures. A set of strategic dashboards provide administrators with granular insights into departmental spending, booking behaviors, vendor negotiations, and policy adherence, and can be viewed by booking type – including airfare, hotel, and car (rental and rideshare). The module also gives a detailed breakdown of project-based spend by client, project, or job to simplify invoicing and budget tracking.\n\nA complete picture of all spend, including a full view of travel spend, allows finance and travel managers to identify and address inefficiencies, adjust policies proactively, simplify invoicing and budget tracking, and negotiate better rates with vendors. Travel approvers can monitor and approve travel expenditures efficiently, with built-in compliance checks that ensure policies are being followed. Travelers also benefit from Center's new 'Insights for Travel' by leveraging the unified view of expenditures and trend analysis to gain a better understanding of their own spending habits with proactive policy violation alerts that help them improve compliance.\n\n\"Center's Insights for Travel has been invaluable for understanding our AMAROK employees' travel trends,\" said Becky Crow, Director of Accounting for AMAROK. \"With clear data on average hotel and flight costs, top travelers, and vendor usage, the dashboard provides a quick overview, while the drill-down capabilities allow me to analyze department-level activity when I need to. This insight is crucial for evaluating our travel policies and identifying areas that may need attention or updating. It's truly amping up the way we approach travel management!\"\n\n\"We know that corporate travel adds value from both a professional and personal perspective for many employees and teams, but it has been a challenging cost to control given preferences to book direct through unmanaged travel channels and the lack of clarity over business expense policies,\" said Naveen Singh, CEO and Co-founder of Center. \"We developed Insights for Travel with this challenge in mind to support our customers' need for a unified view of all travel data, including off-platform bookings. By unlocking holistic visibility into all spend, we're enabling businesses to make more informed decisions, optimize travel spending, and ensure compliance with T&E policies.\"\n\nIn addition to the launch of Insights for Travel, Center has further streamlined and automated the expense process with Smart Receipts, IRS-compliant digital receipts that are automatically attached to expenses that have complete transaction data, saving users time by removing the need to manually attach every receipt.\n\nAbout Center\n\nCenter is a software company modernizing corporate card, travel, and employee expense management with one integrated solution.

      "# [2024 Annual Trends Survey Report on 2024-07-09](https://getcenter.com/2024-annual-trends-survey-report/)\nIn our fifth annual survey, we uncover the evolving practices of expense management in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the factors that influence change. We heard from 200+ US finance leaders, providing a current pulse on trends and challenges in travel and expense.\n\nAs the work landscape continues to evolve, expense management struggles to keep pace. Decentralized employee spending is an ongoing challenge for SMEs—especially in remote and hybrid environments. The survey reveals that while businesses are attempting to control employee expenses by increasing corporate card distribution, they’re not adopting spend management tools at nearly the same rate. This leaves employees with a heavy load of tedious manual processes that slow down finance departments, budget managers, and spenders.\n\nIntelligent solution adoption can help ease manual expense challenges for businesses.\n\nEvolving for Hybrid Work: Managing Rising Travel Spend\n\nWith business travel expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2024², a third of companies report that these workforce changes have made it harder to maintain control over travel spend. 64% of SMEs are experiencing leakage (travel booked outside of corporate travel booking tools), up from 57% the previous year, making it even more difficult for businesses to get in front of the second-highest line item on the ledger.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this climate of shifting compliance norms, it’s more crucial than ever for finance leaders to cut through uncertainty. The gap between spend behaviors and policy control is widening. As business spending changes, expense management must also evolve. Driving efficiency and time savings for finance teams with modern expense management tools should be a top priority for companies looking to create a culture of financial responsibility and profitable growth.",
