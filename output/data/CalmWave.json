My pt says it’s usually an alignment issue that can occur at the hip, knee, or ankle and all three can cause the knee to give out. I assume it depends on how stuff is sitting in the socket on any given day.\n\n## Comment ID m81gn3p with +2 score by [(calmwave-threadbare, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m81gn3p/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nYes, happens to me worst on stairs.

My hips were the first thing to start consistently giving out on me (a little earlier than the age you are now) & for the first few years there was no to very little pain with it. If you can get a PT who specializes in hypermobility disorders, that can be a huge help. Compression sleeves, braces, & mobility supports have been helpful to me.\n\n### Comment ID m81jayx with +1 score by [(charlotte_e6643, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m81jayx/) (in reply to ID m81ia6n):\nwith the nhs not only do i not get to choose, but they all think im stupid when i know more than them, and being a student in september at uni i wont be able to afford private. \n\nmy hips first started acting like they do as far back as i can remember, wasnt painful at the start but is now, are there any braces for those? \n\ndo you have any other conditions that could be causing this or is it just hEDs? just as it seems to be progressing alot more than my other symptoms, im going to get it checked out myself anyway, but my gp is clueless so if you have anything else it could be helpful\n\nthank you\n\n#### Comment ID m82hity with +1 score by [(the_IsolatedIsopod, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m82hity/) (in reply to ID m81jayx):\nI have a thing called The Bodybraid & I do think that helps stabilize my hips, but it's fairly expensive. I wish I'd had it a lot earlier though. it gives me a few extra hours of functionality before I have to call it quits every day. It essentially does my tendons job for them. I'm sure there's other sleeves or braces that can help with hips, but that's the only/the best I've been able to personally get my hands on.\n\nJust the hEDS as far as explanations - I do have a few comorbidities, but none that directly explain the joints in the way the hEDS does. \n\nMy hips went way before the rest of my joints started to follow, I'm not exactly sure why, but I relate to that progressing way faster than the rest.  \n\nMy bodybraid, heating pad, magnesium cream & medicinals are my personal go to for my hips when I'm hurting, & I try to walk & stretch my hips as much as possible when I'm having a good day (in nature, my hips cannot tolerate asphalt)\n\nI hope you're able to find some relief!\n\n## Comment ID m8260w1 with +1 score by [(CallToMuster, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m8260w1/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nYes, I have this all the time. Sometimes it's just random, sometimes it's triggered by something very small like my cat brushing up against my leg. My doctor recently prescribed me custom KAFOs (knee-ankle-foot orthotics) for this and a whole host of other issues and my orthotist is in the process of making them. We're hopeful that the KAFOs will help with my stability when walking.\n\n### Comment ID m827shf with +1 score by [(charlotte_e6643, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m827shf/) (in reply to ID m8260w1):\nplease keep me updated so i can look into it!\n\n## Comment ID m82akt5 with +1 score by [(Toobendy, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m82akt5/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nThis is an old thread, but it has several suggestions for potential causes that are still pertinent today.

Sometimes shaking can be made worse by POTS symptoms which are common for people with EDS so try drinking some electrolyte/salt drinks throughout the day and see if that makes any difference 💖 that is at least what I do, it helps but doesnt get rid fully of the instability\n\n## Comment ID m83vuk5 with +1 score by [(Aut_changeling, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m83vuk5/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nSo I don't know about the shaking, but I had one knee that would buckle unexpectedly sometimes and it turns out that I had an ACL tear for like 10 years without knowing about it. I got it repaired and my knee still hurts and sometimes tries to sublux, but it doesn't buckle in the same way anymore.\n\n## Comment ID m855c2u with +1 score by [(Trappedbirdcage, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m855c2u/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nYep. This is the worst part of my hEDS for me. So many cuts, bruises, scrapes, two dislocations, permanent subluxation... Don't let the doctors tell you it's all in your head. Took me until I was 26 for someone to even mutter the words hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos to me. :/ \n\nI notice it happens when I stumble/trip on something the most.\n\n## Comment ID m86666n with +1 score by [(TheFifthDuckling, Reddit, 2025-01-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1i57phq/does_anyone_elses_legs_give_waybuckle_when_walking/m86666n/) (in reply to ID 1i57phq):\nI have ehlers-danlos, and I notice this, but this symtpom also coincides with a symptom of narcolepsy (a condition often comorbid with EDS) called cataplexy. If you have sleep problems or are really super tired all the time, or notice that the knee weakness comes with strong emotions, I'd give that a look too. The r/Narcolepsy subreddit is super great.\n\nI don't doubt that my knees would still buckle, even without the cataplexy, I just know the cataplexy makes it significantly worse. The other commenters have already beat me to the most useful suggestions for bracing/preventative care."

      "# [AI Cuts ICU Alarm Fatigue by 58%, CalmWave Trial Shows by Harry Salt on 2024-11-01](https://www.fmai-hub.com/ai-cuts-icu-alarm-fatigue-by-58-calmwave-trial-shows/)\nCalmWave, an AI-powered hospital operations platform, achieved a 58% reduction in non-actionable alarms in intensive care units during a successful proof-of-concept with Wellstar Health System.\n\nThese alarms, which account for 80-99% of alerts in intensive care units (ICUs), do not require immediate clinical response and contribute to alarm fatigue—a condition that overwhelms healthcare staff with constant, unnecessary noise.\n\nAlarm fatigue has been linked to increased burnout, cognitive overload, and diminished patient safety, as highlighted by a 2023 NIH study.\n\nCalmWave’s platform tackled this issue by analyzing retrospective ICU data, including bedside monitor signals, medications, and alarm records, to optimize alarm limits for both individual patients and the entire unit.\n\nThe CalmWave Operations Platform uses explainable AI, providing insights into how its models generate conclusions and recommendations.\n\nAccording to the tech company, this transparency “empowers” healthcare organizations to optimize operations and make data-driven decisions.\n\nBy tuning alarm settings through AI-driven insights, the system offers recommendations that drastically reduce non-actionable alerts while maintaining patient safety.\n\n“Wellstar’s commitment to innovation and its forward-thinking approach to positive change make it the perfect partner to solve the entrenched problem of alarm fatigue. Wellstar understands the power of big data and the criticality of world-class healthcare technology,” said Ophir Ronen, founder and CEO of CalmWave.\n\n“The problem of alarm fatigue is foundational, endemic to every hospital around the world, and we are thrilled to be working with Wellstar to change this unacceptable status quo. Through our successful pilot program, we have demonstrated that CalmWave has the potential to be the first effective alarm fatigue solution.”\n\nWellstar plans to implement CalmWave’s platform in a larger ICU pilot to test these recommendations in real-time.\n\nBacking this effort, Catalyst by Wellstar, an innovation and venture arm of one of Georgia’s largest health systems, has made a strategic investment in CalmWave.\n\n“We are focused on advancing healthcare technology that enhances both patient and team member experiences while prioritizing quality and safety,” added Dr. Hank Capps, EVP and chief information and digital officer for Wellstar Health System, and president of Catalyst by Wellstar.\n\n“We’re excited for our growing collaboration with CalmWave, which is harnessing the power of AI to address critical challenges like alarm fatigue and improve patient care outcomes in a meaningful way.”\n\nCatalyst by Wellstar has also made a strategic investment in the company, underscoring the potential to improve patient safety and monitoring efficiency.",

    "# CalmWave Company and Product Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\nCalmWave is a healthtech startup founded in 2022, based in Seattle, Washington. The company focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to address alarm fatigue in healthcare settings, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). CalmWave aims to improve nurse retention and enhance patient safety by optimizing alarm systems in hospitals. The company has raised a total of $9.25 million in funding, with notable investors including Bonfire Ventures and Tau Ventures [(25 Top Seattle Startups to Watch in 2025, TRUiC Team, 2024-07-02)](https://startupsavant.com/startups-to-watch/seattle).\n\n## Product Overview\n\nCalmWave's primary product is the CalmWave Operations Platform, which utilizes explainable AI to analyze ICU data, including bedside monitor signals and alarm records.

This reduction is significant, considering that non-actionable alarms account for 80-99% of alerts in ICUs, contributing to alarm fatigue and associated issues like burnout and diminished patient safety [(AI Cuts ICU Alarm Fatigue by 58%, CalmWave Trial Shows, Harry Salt, 2024-11-01)](https://www.fmai-hub.com/ai-cuts-icu-alarm-fatigue-by-58-calmwave-trial-shows/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nCalmWave has established a strategic partnership with Wellstar Health System, which has committed to implementing the CalmWave platform in a larger ICU pilot to test its recommendations in real-time.

This agreement is expected to enhance CalmWave's market presence and validate its capabilities in addressing alarm fatigue [(Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations, 2024-09-06)](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/partners-cooperative).\n\n### Funding and Financials\n\nIn a recent financing round, CalmWave raised $5.25 million, led by Third Prime, with participation from Catalyst by Wellstar and other investors.

His leadership is pivotal in driving CalmWave's innovative approach to healthcare technology.\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nCalmWave operates in a competitive landscape that includes various healthtech companies focused on alarm management and healthcare operations. Its unique selling proposition lies in its use of transparent AI to build trust with clinicians and streamline hospital operations, particularly in reducing alarm fatigue [(Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations, 2024-09-06)](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/partners-cooperative).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCalmWave is positioned as a promising player in the healthtech sector, with a strong focus on improving patient care and operational efficiency through innovative AI solutions. The company's recent partnerships, funding successes, and commitment to addressing alarm fatigue highlight its potential for growth and impact in the healthcare industry. Prospective candidates and investors should consider CalmWave's unique approach and the increasing demand for effective healthcare technology solutions."
