The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is the first prescription video game approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children aged 8 to 17 with ADHD <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)</a>.</p>
<h2>Products and Services</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Business Model and Revenue</h2>
<p>Akili operates on a B2C model, primarily targeting individuals with ADHD. Initially, the company focused on prescription-based sales but has recently shifted towards non-prescription sales to increase direct consumer access. In 2022, Akili reported a revenue of $323,000, which improved to $1.7 million in 2023, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC <a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717576/">(Reuter, BioPharma Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>
<p>Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp., initially achieving a market valuation of around $1 billion. However, the company has faced significant financial challenges, including substantial layoffs and a shift in its business model <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/">(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024-05-29)</a>.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Descriptions</h2>
<p>Third-party sources describe Akili as a trailblazer in digital therapeutics, particularly noting the FDA approval of EndeavorRx as a significant milestone. However, they also highlight the company's financial struggles and strategic shifts as it navigates the competitive landscape of digital health <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)</a>.</p>

      <p>You know it really does baffle me that mental illness is only supported when your young but if you need help when your an adult your out of luck, which is funny because it doesn't go away as you age, it might get a little better or worse but It will never be gone, so it is just crazy if your an adult with these isues, then your down a creek without a padle because there is literally no support if you have mental issues and are an adult. I just don't understand it.</p>

      <p>Biggest waste of money ever. I was SO excited when the pediatric neuro recommended this for my 10yo and 7yo with ADHD. I homeschool, we use medication, and we use screens at home (but not excessively). I have absolutely no idea how this got approved by the FDA. This made the ADHD WORSE for my kids!!! I paid $100 per month for each kid. We did it two months, as recommended, and my kids' behavior was AWFUL. Their impulsivity SKYROCKETED, as did forgetfulness. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</p>

      <p>Disappointed that you have to have a Rx to even sign in or play the game, even if you've been diagnosed already. I'll just find another game we can play. Also reading that it's only for kids, and it costs more than ADHD medication. Seriously, go grab a multitasking game and play it for 20-30 mins a day instead of wasting money on this when you could just buy your medication.</p>

      <p>100 a month price, reflects a play on parents fears more than the cost of research and development. With over 35 years of gaming experience and after 9 years of looking into price gouging products that add the words adhd or autism to the labels, its obvious and disappoints me a great deal. I've seen 100 for $5 turn into $20 a piece by adding those words. This product helps because, he is using words associated with a mental awareness of course, so that's a plus. Overpriced as it is. Worth itISH!</p>

      <p>The game itself is great my child enjoys playing it. However, it is very frustrating that it is only compatible with one device we own. Our computer, tablet and kindle are all newer and yet none of them are compatible with this game. My S10 is the only one that it will work with. I would recommend verifying compatibility, before spending so much on a game that only works with minimal electronics.</p>

      <p>Why do you HAVE to have a prescription to play this? If is can help kids with ADHD why not have it be a readily available resource? It's not medication, it's a game that can have benefits to children with ADHD. Are kids who don't have insurance or who's insurance won't cover this or the cost less deserving of potential aid? What are the potential risks of someone without ADHD playing this game?</p>

      <p>Do not fall into this trap. We were willing to try anything for our son so we paid 300 dollars for this. It was the worst experience ever. The kids do not like playing it. It starts out saying they have a certain number of missions then adds missions at then end when they think they're going to be done. Changing it up on them like this, they cannot handle it. That's one of the biggest symptoms of adhd. Do not waste your money. I wish we could get refunded. There's been nothing good come of this.</p>
