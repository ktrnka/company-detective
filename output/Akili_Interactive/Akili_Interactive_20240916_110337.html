            <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create digital medicines. Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This innovative approach challenges traditional methods of treatment, offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<h3>EndeavorRx</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indications</strong>: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD, aiming to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.</li>
<li><strong>Cautions</strong>: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions like photo-sensitive epilepsy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EndeavorOTC</h3>

</ul>
<h2>Business Model and Revenue</h2>
<p>Akili operates on a B2C model, selling its products directly to consumers. The company initially focused on prescription-based sales but has recently shifted towards direct-to-consumer models, including the launch of <strong>EndeavorOTC</strong>, an over-the-counter version of its ADHD treatment for adults. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>
<p>Akili has undergone significant changes over time, including going public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, achieving a valuation of approximately $1 billion at that time <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>. However, the company has faced financial challenges, leading to workforce reductions and a strategic shift towards more sustainable business models.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Akili's products are distributed through digital platforms, making them easily accessible to users. The company also engages with the community through its <strong>Akili Ambassador Program</strong>, which empowers individuals with ADHD and their families to share their experiences and advocate for innovative treatment options.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Descriptions</h2>
<p>Third parties describe Akili as a trailblazer in the digital therapeutics space, particularly for its innovative approach to ADHD treatment through video games. However, the company has faced scrutiny due to its financial struggles and the challenges of securing insurance coverage for its FDA-approved products.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics</h2>
<p>On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html">(Business Wire, 2024)</a>. Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240701029834/en/">(Virtual Therapeutics, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Workforce Reductions</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD. This decision followed a series of layoffs and strategic shifts aimed at restructuring the company to focus on more sustainable business models <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>Akili's financial performance has been challenging, with reported revenues of $1.7 million in 2023, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC. The company faced a net loss of $59.5 million in the same year <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>. The acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is seen as a strategic move to stabilize the company amid these financial difficulties.</p>
<h2>Market Context and Challenges</h2>
<p>The digital therapeutics market has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing insurance coverage for FDA-approved products. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the sector, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 due to similar issues with payer coverage <a href="cache://endpts/33">(Endpoints News, 2024)</a>. The recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is part of a broader trend of consolidation in the digital health space as companies seek to enhance their offerings and stabilize financially <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/">(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)</a>.</p>
