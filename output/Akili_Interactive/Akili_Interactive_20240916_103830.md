# About Akili Interactive

Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, **EndeavorRx**, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This groundbreaking approach challenges traditional treatment methods by offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.

## Products

### EndeavorRx
- **Indications**: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).
- **Safety**: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.
- **Cautions**: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions, such as photo-sensitive epilepsy.

### EndeavorOTC
- A new treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding the reach of Akili's digital therapeutics. This product received FDA clearance in 2024, making it the first FDA-authorized digital therapeutic available without a prescription [(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024)](https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/).

## Business Model and Revenue
Akili operates primarily on a B2C model, targeting individuals with ADHD and their families. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutics, although it has faced challenges in securing insurance coverage for its products, which has hindered its commercial viability. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with a net loss of $59.5 million [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).

## Company Evolution
Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, achieving a valuation of approximately $1 billion at that time [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/). However, the company has faced significant operational challenges, including multiple rounds of layoffs and sluggish sales of its ADHD treatment. In 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, valuing the company at approximately $34 million [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).

## Third-Party Descriptions
Third-party sources describe Akili as an innovative but struggling company in the digital therapeutics market. While its products have received FDA approval and clinical validation, the company has faced significant challenges in establishing a sustainable business model and securing insurance reimbursement [(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)](https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/).

## Comprehensive Report on Akili Interactive

### Company Overview
Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and based in Boston, is a pioneering digital therapeutics company that develops video game-based treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The company gained significant attention in 2020 when it became the first to receive FDA clearance for a prescription video game, EndeavorRx, aimed at improving attention in children aged 8 to 17. Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, achieving a valuation of approximately $1 billion at that time [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).

### Recent Developments
#### Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics
On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html). Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/).

#### Workforce Reductions
In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce, a move attributed to sluggish sales of its ADHD treatment and a strategic shift towards exploring alternative business models. This marked the third significant round of layoffs within a year, reflecting ongoing challenges in the digital therapeutics market [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/).

#### Financial Performance
Despite initial success, Akili has struggled to establish a sustainable business model. In 2023, the company reported revenues of $1.7 million, with a net loss of $59.5 million. The company has also faced challenges in securing insurance coverage for its products, which has hindered its commercial viability [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).

### Product Information
#### EndeavorRx
EndeavorRx is a prescription digital therapeutic designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. The game utilizes sensory stimuli and motor challenges to engage users and has been validated through clinical trials. In 2024, Akili also received FDA clearance for EndeavorOTC, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults with ADHD, marking it as the first FDA-authorized digital therapeutic available without a prescription [(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024)](https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/).

#### Clinical Validation
EndeavorRx has shown promising results in clinical trials, with studies indicating that 73% of children reported improved attention after using the game. The adult version, EndeavorOTC, has also demonstrated significant improvements in focus and quality of life among users [(Rendall, CNET, 2023)](https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/what-to-know-about-endeavor-the-video-game-to-treat-adhd/).

### Executive Leadership
Matt Franklin serves as the CEO of Akili Interactive. He has emphasized the company's commitment to delivering value to shareholders and addressing the growing mental health crisis through innovative digital solutions. Dan Elenbaas, co-founder and CEO of Virtual Therapeutics, has expressed confidence in Akili's expertise and its potential to enhance the combined company's offerings [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).

### Market Context and Challenges
The digital therapeutics sector has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing reimbursement from insurers. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the space, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023. The ongoing difficulties in establishing a sustainable business model for digital therapeutics have led to increased consolidation within the industry [(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)](https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/).

### Conclusion
Akili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its history, transitioning from a public company to a subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics amid significant operational challenges. While its innovative products like EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC have garnered FDA approval and clinical validation, the company must navigate a complex landscape of reimbursement issues and market competition to achieve long-term success. The upcoming merger with Virtual Therapeutics may provide new opportunities for growth and expansion in the digital health sector. 

For prospective candidates and investors, understanding Akili's trajectory and the broader context of the digital therapeutics market will be crucial in assessing future opportunities and risks.
