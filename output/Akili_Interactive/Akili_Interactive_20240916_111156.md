Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

## Products

### EndeavorRx
- **Indications**: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).
- **Safety**: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.
- **Cautions**: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions, such as photo-sensitive epilepsy.

### EndeavorOTC
- A new treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding the reach of Akili's digital therapeutics.

## Business Model and Revenue
Akili Interactive operates on a B2C model, primarily targeting individuals with ADHD and their families. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutics, both prescription-based and over-the-counter. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million but faced a net loss of $59.5 million due to challenges in securing insurance coverage for its products [(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).
