## Products

### EndeavorRx
- **Indications**: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).
- **Safety**: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.

## Comprehensive Report on Akili Interactive

### Company Overview
Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and based in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering digital therapeutics company that develops video game-based treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The company gained significant attention in 2020 when it became the first to receive FDA clearance for a prescription video game, EndeavorRx, designed to improve attention in children aged 8 to 17 years [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-05-29)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/). Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, initially valuing the company at around $1 billion [(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/).

### Recent Developments

On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million [(Business Wire, 2024-05-29)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html). The merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions [(Virtual Therapeutics, 2024-07-02)](https://www.biospace.com/virtual-therapeutics-announces-results-of-tender-offer-to-acquire-akili-interactive).

#### Workforce Reductions
In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales and a strategic shift away from its prescription model. This decision followed a series of layoffs over the past year, reflecting broader challenges in the digital therapeutics sector [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). The company has also been exploring strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value [(Gonzales, BH Business, 2024-05-01)](https://bhbusiness.com/2024/05/01/akili-cuts-46-of-staff-explores-strategic-options/).

#### Financial Performance
In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with a net loss of $59.5 million. The company has struggled to build a sustainable business model, particularly in securing insurance coverage for its products [(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/). Following the announcement of its strategic review, Akili's stock price fell significantly, leading to the acquisition offer from Virtual Therapeutics [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-05-29)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/).

### Product Information
#### EndeavorRx
EndeavorRx is a prescription digital therapeutic designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. The game utilizes sensory stimuli and motor challenges to engage users and has been validated through clinical trials [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024-05-29)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/). In June 2024, Akili received FDA clearance for EndeavorOTC, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults with ADHD, which is expected to enhance accessibility and revenue potential [(FDA, 2024-06-18)](https://www.mpo-mag.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2024-06-18/fda-oks-akilis-endeavorotc-video-game-for-adhd/).

#### Clinical Validation
EndeavorRx has shown promising results in clinical trials, with studies indicating significant improvements in attention metrics among users. For instance, a trial reported that 73% of children using EndeavorRx experienced improved attention compared to 50% in the control group [(Rendall, CNET, 2023-12-24)](https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/what-to-know-about-endeavor-the-video-game-to-treat-adhd/). However, the company has faced challenges in payer acceptance and reimbursement, which has hindered its commercial success [(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024-08-19)](https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/).

### Leadership and Vision
Matt Franklin serves as the CEO of Akili, emphasizing the company's commitment to delivering clinically validated solutions for ADHD and other cognitive impairments. He stated, "Combining our proven track record developing and deploying rigorously validated mobile digital therapeutics with Virtual Therapeutics’ robust portfolio... we aim to create a compelling platform to address mental health needs across several high-impact indications" [(Business Wire, 2024-05-29)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).

### Market Context and Challenges
The digital therapeutics sector has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing reimbursement from insurers. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the space, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 due to similar issues [(Endpoints News, 2024-06-06)](cache://endpts/33). The recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is seen as a strategic move to consolidate resources and expertise in a competitive market.

### Conclusion
Akili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its history, transitioning from a public company to a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics. While it has made significant strides in developing innovative digital therapeutics for ADHD, the company faces ongoing challenges in achieving commercial viability and securing reimbursement. The merger may provide the necessary support to navigate these challenges and expand its impact in the digital health space.
