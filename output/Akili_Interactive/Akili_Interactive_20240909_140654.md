# About Akili Interactive

Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, is a pioneering company in the field of digital therapeutics. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, **EndeavorRx**, is the first prescription video game approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children aged 8 to 17 with ADHD [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/).

## Products and Services

### EndeavorRx
- **Indications**: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).
- **Safety**: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.
- **Cautions**: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for patients with certain conditions like photo-sensitive epilepsy.

### EndeavorOTC
- A new treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding the reach of Akili's digital therapeutics. This product has been well-received, with 126,000 first-time downloads and 4,200 active users reported in its initial months of availability [(Larson, BH Business, 2023-09-13)](https://bhbusiness.com/2023/09/13/akili-bails-on-prescription-digital-therapeutic-route-lays-off-40-of-staff/).

## Business Model and Revenue
Akili operates on a B2C model, primarily targeting individuals with ADHD. Initially, the company focused on prescription-based sales but has recently shifted towards non-prescription sales to increase direct consumer access. In 2022, Akili reported a revenue of $323,000, which improved to $1.7 million in 2023, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC [(Reuter, BioPharma Dive, 2024-05-30)](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717576/).

However, the company has faced significant financial challenges, including substantial layoffs and a shift in its business model [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024-05-29)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/).

## Comprehensive Report on Akili Interactive

### Company Overview
Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and based in Boston, is a pioneering digital therapeutics company that develops video game-based treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The company gained prominence with its product, EndeavorRx, which became the first prescription video game approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020 for children aged 8 to 17 with ADHD [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with Social Capital Suvretta Holdings Corp., initially achieving a market valuation of around $1 billion, but has since faced significant financial challenges [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024-05-29)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/).

#### Financial Performance
In recent years, Akili has struggled with revenue generation. The company reported a revenue of $323,000 in 2022, a 40% decrease from the previous year, and a net loss of $19 million [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2023-09-13)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-cuts-workforce-shift-non-prescription/693545/). By 2023, Akili's revenue had slightly improved to $1.7 million, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC, which generated $1.2 million [(Reuter, BioPharma Dive, 2024-05-30)](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717576/). The company has also faced significant layoffs, reducing its workforce by 40% in September 2023 and an additional 46% in April 2024, as it shifted its business model from prescription-based to non-prescription sales [(Larson, BH Business, 2023-09-13)](https://bhbusiness.com/2023/09/13/akili-bails-on-prescription-digital-therapeutic-route-lays-off-40-of-staff/).

### Product Overview
#### EndeavorRx
EndeavorRx is a video game designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. The game requires players to navigate obstacles and collect targets, thereby training their attention and cognitive skills. Clinical trials have shown that 73% of children using EndeavorRx reported improvements in attention compared to 50% in the control group [(Rendall, CNET, 2023-12-24)](https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/what-to-know-about-endeavor-the-video-game-to-treat-adhd/). 

#### EndeavorOTC
In response to market challenges, Akili launched EndeavorOTC, a non-prescription version aimed at adults with ADHD. This product has been well-received, with 126,000 first-time downloads and 4,200 active users reported in its initial months of availability [(Larson, BH Business, 2023-09-13)](https://bhbusiness.com/2023/09/13/akili-bails-on-prescription-digital-therapeutic-route-lays-off-40-of-staff/). The FDA granted clearance for EndeavorOTC in June 2024, marking it as the first FDA-authorized over-the-counter digital therapeutic for adult ADHD [(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024-06-20)](https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/).

### Strategic Changes and Acquisitions
In light of its financial difficulties, Akili has been exploring strategic alternatives. In May 2024, the company announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, which will acquire Akili for approximately $34 million, valuing the company at $0.4340 per share [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024-05-29)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/). This merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024 and will allow Akili to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics [(Business Wire, 2024-05-29)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240529504802/en/).

### Leadership and Vision
Eddie Martucci, co-founder and CEO of Akili, has emphasized the company's commitment to delivering value to its shareholders and expanding access to its digital therapeutics. He stated, "A non-prescription model removes reliance on intermediaries, which we believe will give us more control over our growth and enable us to build a lasting, sustainable business" [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2023-09-13)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-cuts-workforce-shift-non-prescription/693545/). The merger with Virtual Therapeutics is seen as a strategic move to leverage their combined expertise in digital health and gaming to address mental health needs more effectively [(Tracy, PharmaExec, 2024-05-31)](https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games).

### Market Context and Challenges
The digital therapeutics market has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing payer coverage for prescription products. Akili's experience reflects a broader trend in the industry, where companies like Pear Therapeutics have struggled to maintain operations and have filed for bankruptcy [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-04-30)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/). Akili's shift to a non-prescription model aims to mitigate these challenges by reducing reliance on insurance coverage and increasing direct consumer access to its products [(Reuter & Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2023-09-13)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-cuts-workforce-shift-non-prescription/693545/).

### Conclusion
Akili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its journey, transitioning from a prescription-based model to a more consumer-focused approach with its EndeavorOTC product. The upcoming merger with Virtual Therapeutics presents an opportunity for Akili to leverage new resources and expertise to enhance its offerings in the digital health space. However, the company must navigate ongoing market challenges and demonstrate the efficacy and value of its products to sustain growth and profitability in the competitive landscape of digital therapeutics. 

For prospective candidates and investors, Akili represents a unique opportunity in the evolving field of digital health, particularly as it seeks to innovate and expand its reach in addressing ADHD and other cognitive impairments.
