            <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This groundbreaking approach challenges traditional treatment methods by offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<h3>EndeavorRx</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indications</strong>: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.</li>

<h2>Business Model and Revenue</h2>
<p>Akili Interactive operates on a B2C model, primarily targeting individuals with ADHD and their families. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutics, both prescription-based and over-the-counter. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million but faced a net loss of $59.5 million due to challenges in securing insurance coverage for its products <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Scale and Distribution</h2>
<p>Akili's products are distributed through major app stores, making them easily accessible to users. The company has also shifted its focus from prescription sales to direct-to-consumer models, including the launch of EndeavorOTC <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>
<p>Since its founding, Akili has undergone significant changes, including going public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, achieving a valuation of approximately $1 billion at that time <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>. However, the company has faced financial difficulties, leading to workforce reductions and strategic shifts.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Descriptions</h2>
<p>Third parties describe Akili as a trailblazer in the digital therapeutics space, particularly for its innovative approach to treating ADHD through video games. However, the company has also been noted for its financial struggles and challenges in achieving market acceptance <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/">(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)</a>.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics</h2>
<p>On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html">(Business Wire, 2024)</a>.

<h2>Workforce Reductions</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce, a move attributed to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD.

The financial difficulties were compounded by a significant drop in stock price, leading to a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October 2023 <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>.</p>
