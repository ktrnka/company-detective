            <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This groundbreaking approach challenges traditional treatment methods by offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<h3>EndeavorRx</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indications</strong>: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.</li>
<li><strong>Cautions</strong>: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions, such as photo-sensitive epilepsy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EndeavorOTC</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding the reach of Akili's digital therapeutics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Model and Revenue</h2>
<p>Akili operates primarily on a B2C model, targeting patients and their families directly. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutics, although it has faced challenges in securing insurance coverage for its products. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with a net loss of $59.5 million <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>
<p>Akili went public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, initially valuing the company at around $1 billion <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>. However, due to sluggish sales and strategic shifts, the company announced significant workforce reductions in 2024 and is now in the process of being acquired by Virtual Therapeutics <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-05-29)</a>.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Akili's products are distributed through healthcare providers who prescribe EndeavorRx to patients. The company is also expanding its reach with EndeavorOTC, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults with ADHD, which received FDA clearance in June 2024 <a href="https://www.mpo-mag.com/contents/view_breaking-news/2024-06-18/fda-oks-akilis-endeavorotc-video-game-for-adhd/">(FDA, 2024-06-18)</a>.</p>

<h3>Product Features</h3>
