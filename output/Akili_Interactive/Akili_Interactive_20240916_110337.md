# About Akili Interactive

Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create digital medicines. Akili's flagship product, **EndeavorRx**, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This innovative approach challenges traditional methods of treatment, offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.

## Products

### EndeavorRx

- **Safety**: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.
- **Cautions**: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions like photo-sensitive epilepsy.

## Business Model and Revenue

## Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics
On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html). Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics [(Virtual Therapeutics, 2024)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240701029834/en/).

## Workforce Reductions
In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD. This decision followed a series of layoffs and strategic shifts aimed at restructuring the company to focus on more sustainable business models [(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/).

## Financial Performance
Akili's financial performance has been challenging, with reported revenues of $1.7 million in 2023, primarily from its over-the-counter product, EndeavorOTC. The company faced a net loss of $59.5 million in the same year [(Reuter, MedTech Dive, 2024)](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/). The acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is seen as a strategic move to stabilize the company amid these financial difficulties.

## Market Context and Challenges
The digital therapeutics market has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing insurance coverage for FDA-approved products. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the sector, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 due to similar issues with payer coverage [(Endpoints News, 2024)](cache://endpts/33). The recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is part of a broader trend of consolidation in the digital health space as companies seek to enhance their offerings and stabilize financially [(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)](https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/).

### Product Information
#### EndeavorRx
EndeavorRx is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. The game utilizes sensory stimuli and motor challenges to engage users and has been validated through clinical trials. In 2020, it received FDA clearance, marking a significant milestone as the first video game approved for treating a medical condition [(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/). 

#### EndeavorOTC
In June 2024, Akili received FDA clearance for **EndeavorOTC**, the first over-the-counter digital therapeutic for adults with ADHD. This product is designed to enhance attention function and is available for purchase without a prescription, reflecting a shift in Akili's business strategy to reach a broader audience [(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024)](https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/).

### Leadership and Vision
Matt Franklin serves as the CEO of Akili and has emphasized the company's commitment to delivering clinically validated solutions for ADHD. He stated, "Combining our proven track record developing and deploying rigorously validated mobile digital therapeutics with Virtual Therapeutics’ robust portfolio... we aim to create a compelling platform to address mental health needs across several high-impact indications" [(Business Wire, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html).

### Market Context and Challenges
The digital therapeutics market has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing insurance coverage for FDA-approved products. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the sector, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023 due to similar issues with payer coverage [(Endpoints News, 2024)](cache://endpts/33). The recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics is part of a broader trend of consolidation in the digital health space as companies seek to enhance their offerings and stabilize financially [(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)](https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/).

### Conclusion
Akili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its history, transitioning from a public company to a subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics amid significant workforce reductions and financial challenges. The company's innovative approach to ADHD treatment through video games has garnered attention, but its future success will depend on the effective integration with Virtual Therapeutics and the ability to navigate the complex landscape of digital therapeutics and insurance reimbursement. 

For prospective candidates and investors, the merger presents both opportunities and risks, as the combined entity aims to leverage Akili's expertise in digital therapeutics to address the growing mental health crisis.
