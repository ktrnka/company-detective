            <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is a prescription video game designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-17 with ADHD. This groundbreaking approach challenges traditional treatment methods by offering a more engaging and enjoyable experience for patients.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<h3>EndeavorRx</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indications</strong>: Designed for children aged 8-17 with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD. It aims to improve attention as measured by the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA®).</li>
<li><strong>Safety</strong>: Clinical trials showed low rates of treatment-related adverse events (TE-ADE), with no serious adverse events reported. Common TE-ADEs included frustration and headache.</li>
<li><strong>Cautions</strong>: It is a prescription-only device and should not be used as a standalone treatment. It may not be suitable for children with certain conditions, such as photo-sensitive epilepsy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EndeavorOTC</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding the reach of Akili's digital therapeutics. It received FDA clearance in June 2024 and is available without a prescription.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Model and Revenue</h2>
<p>Akili operates on a B2C model, primarily targeting individuals with ADHD. The company initially focused on prescription-based models but has recently shifted towards over-the-counter sales with the launch of EndeavorOTC. Despite initial success, Akili has faced financial challenges, reporting revenues of $1.7 million in 2023 with a net loss of $59.5 million <a href="https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/">(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Akili's products are distributed digitally, with users downloading the therapeutic games onto their mobile devices. The company also engages in community initiatives, such as the Akili Ambassador Program, to empower individuals with ADHD to share their experiences and contribute to product development.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>
<p>Akili has undergone significant changes over time, including going public in 2022 through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, achieving a valuation of approximately $1 billion at that time <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>. However, the company has faced ongoing challenges in building a sustainable business model, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs and a recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html">(Business Wire, 2024)</a>.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics</h2>
<p>On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics, a company focused on mental health solutions through immersive games. Under the terms of the agreement, Akili shareholders will receive $0.4340 per share in cash, valuing the company at approximately $34 million. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to certain conditions <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html">(Business Wire, 2024)</a>. Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/05/29/business/akili-interactive-merge-with-washington-based-virtual-therapeutics/">(Walia, Boston Globe, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Workforce Reductions</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce, a move attributed to sluggish sales of its ADHD treatment and a broader evaluation of strategic alternatives. This marked the third significant round of layoffs within a year, reflecting ongoing challenges in building a sustainable business model in the digital therapeutics space <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>Despite initial success, Akili has struggled financially. In 2023, the company reported revenues of $1.7 million, with a net loss of $59.5 million. The company has shifted its focus from prescription-based models to over-the-counter sales, launching <strong>EndeavorOTC</strong>, which is designed for adults with ADHD and received FDA clearance in June 2024 <a href="https://www.digitalhealthglobal.com/akili-secures-fda-clearance-for-endeavorotc/">(Scarpinati, Digital Health Global, 2024)</a>. The over-the-counter version has shown promising results, with 83% of participants in clinical trials reporting improved focus <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240701029834/en/">(Franklin, Business Wire, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Market Context and Challenges</h2>
<p>The digital therapeutics sector has faced significant challenges, particularly in securing reimbursement from insurers. Akili's struggles mirror those of other companies in the space, such as Pear Therapeutics, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023. The lack of widespread insurance coverage for digital therapeutics has hindered market growth and sustainability <a href="https://medcitynews.com/2024/08/digital-therapeutics-reimbursement-cms-medicare-insurance-payers-clinical-trials/">(Vinluan, MedCity News, 2024)</a>.</p>

<h3>Regulatory Information</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Business Model</h3>

<h2>Product: Akili Interactive</h2>
<h3>Product Features</h3>
