Bill Roberts, with twenty years of history at the TFS Companies and currently in the position of Vice President and Wealth Advisor in the Wealth Management Team, has a passion for his service to clients in helping them realize their goals and objectives.

Client Experience

THE TFS CLIENT EXPERIENCE

WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO

Private Wealth Management is our premier service. The clients who benefit the most from our service are generally successful professionals, some who are now entering their retirement years and wish to delegate their financial planning issues to a trusted advisor so they can be free to pursue a higher quality of life. They tend to be values-centered and they want to make smart choices about their money based upon what is important to them.

As your trusted advisor, we coordinate a professional resource team of specialists including Certified Financial Planners, Certified Public Accountants, Estate Attorneys, Investment Managers and Insurance Professionals to deliver our Private Wealth Management Service. The implementation of your plan and the monitoring of your progress over time is all a part of Private Wealth Management.

At TFS, The Private Wealth Management Client Experience is characterized by special value-added services that may include...

An annually updated Financial Road Map, which focuses on your values, goals and benchmarking your progress. It is reviewed with your tax and legal advisors.

An annually updated implementation plan, which summarizes the financial plan into a simple chronological list of action items.

Periodic progress reports that summarize the assets and the progress made toward your expressed goals.

Annual income tax planning to estimate and minimize taxes and forestall any surprises in April.

Periodic reviews of your estate plan. We'll review it more frequently if congress changes the rules or if something in your situation changes.

Assistance with cash, debt management, bill paying, record keeping, and major purchases as needed.

Periodic Insurance reviews to determine whether you actually need insurance, how much you need and also determine, based on your stage of life, what the right type of insurance for you would be.

Ongoing attention to milestones and goals and a game plan for accomplishing those goals, and updating the game plan when the financial plan is updated annually.

We feel the accomplishment of your goals is the greatest evidence that you have made smart choices about your money. It allows you to focus on the things in life that are really important to you. That is the mission of Private Wealth Management.

ELEVATE YOUR CAREER.

SEE WHERE TOMORROW TAKES YOU.

Small firm attention. With the complete financial world at your fingertips.

Life as a financial professional holds incredible opportunities for career success, personal fulfillment, and client satisfaction. At the same time, today’s highly competitive, increasingly regulated world can feel like an endless series of hoops to jump through and headaches to manage.

We believe you deserve more from your career.

At Tomorrow’s Financial Services (TFS), we have helped hundreds of ambitious, principled financial advisors like you achieve their dreams since 1976.

The TFS Advantage

As a privately owned business, our priority is to foster a supportive environment that encourages all of our employees and clients to excel. We don’t have outside investors, shareholders or private-equity firms pushing us to cut costs or corners. Instead, we offer total transparency, stable management, and complete independence.

When you join TFS, you gain a full suite of incredibly sophisticated resources — and direct access to every member of our firm’s leadership. As a result, you can provide your clients with the best possible service and support, while maintaining ownership of your book.

A Partner for Today — and Tomorrow

Chances are, you talk to your clients about their long-term goals — and how the choices they make today have a powerful impact on the life they live tomorrow. Every day, you help them seize the opportunities that will bring their dreams to life.

Are you doing the same for your own career?

With TFS, you can find true independence, long-term growth and the support you need. Unlike firms who offer big signing bonuses that come with even bigger strings attached, we will be your ally and advocate for the rest of your career. Our team will help you become each client’s primary trusted advisor, the person they turn to whenever they have a question or concern in their financial life.

When you join TFS, you can build the future you desire:

Grow your income

Increase your profitability

Improve your productivity

Streamline your operations

Compete more effectively

And most importantly, with our firm, you will have the freedom and ability to better serve your clients’ full wealth management needs.

What to Expect With TFS

Complete Independence

At TFS, you are free to run your practice your way. From market niche and revenue style to office location and hiring choices, you maintain control. And, you will never have to push proprietary products or meet sales quotas, so you can focus on your clients’ best interests, rather than corporate demands.

Excellent Compensation

We believe hard work deserves to be rewarded. So, we not only offer very competitive compensation — but we also provide a wide range of bonus opportunities. We’ll show you the many ways you can boost revenue with production bonuses, management overrides, overhead reimbursement programs and other lucrative opportunities.

Practice Management

We won’t dictate how you grow your practice, but we will be by your side providing support and insight that help you get to the next level. TFS Practice Management Consultants can guide you in all areas including selecting office space, comparing IT solutions, analyzing client agreements and navigating your prior contractual obligations.

Sophisticated Technology

We provide a suite of technology services that will make your work more efficient and connected. Our goal is to make every tool and resource you need to do your job accessible wherever and whenever you need it: forms, research, rates, trades, statements, financial planning and more.

A Simple Transition

Change can feel daunting, but we are here to ease your burdens. Our experienced Transition Task Force will help you make the move to independence with confidence through each step. We’ll even save you hours and hassle by printing all of your transition forms with pre-populated client, representative and broker-dealer data.

Supportive Compliance

Ultimately, our compliance team is here to protect your practice without holding you back. We know you need to connect with clients and prospects — but at many firms, compliance can be so bureaucratic and oppressive that it feels like sales prevention. So, we bring a collaborative, supportive perspective to our reviews, and work one-on-one with advisors to make intelligent business decisions while ensuring suitable and appropriate recommendations for our clients.

Succession and Continuity Planning

Take charge of your future by building a book of business you own and control. When the time comes for you to retire, we will help you find the best opportunity to maximize the value of the business you’ve worked so hard to build. Whether you want to grow a team that spans generations — or you’d rather sell your practice — we will support and assist you with solutions that uphold your goals, needs and values. At TFS, we work closely with our advisors to custom tailor succession and continuity planning strategies to their unique objectives.

The TFS Family of Companies

As a member of our team, you will have direct access to all of our affiliated firms’ services and leadership. And because each company shares a commitment to world-class service, you’ll enjoy synchronized support with every interaction.

TFS Securities, Inc.

Home to independent financial professionals since 1987, TFS Securities, Inc. is one of the few remaining boutique broker dealers in our industry. Here, you can enjoy one-on-one service, personalized training, and freedom from bureaucracy. You’ll even have a say in where the company goes, because our leadership will know and listen to you.

But don’t let our small size fool you. We have licenses to transact business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. And with state-of-the-art technology that rivals our largest competitors — along with a payout up to 98% — you’ll quickly see why our approach catapults advisors‘ careers.

TFS Insurance Brokerage, Inc.

Insurance is a valuable part of most wealth management strategies, but we think you should be free to choose the offerings that best suit your clients’ needs — rather than having to push proprietary products or meet quotas. TFS Insurance Brokerage represents more than 50 carriers, and we will help you find the options that fit your clients’ unique situations.

Simplify your work and earn highly competitive compensation with our state-of-the art producer website, quoting tools, status engine, and fully automated back office.

TFS Mortgage Corporation, Inc.

Proper financial planning and wealth management addresses more than just assets. Managing debts and liabilities is critical. When your clients need to purchase a home, refinance a mortgage, or incorporate more advanced leveraging strategies, they should turn to you. TFS Mortgage Corporation helps you deepen your role as a primary trusted advisor by offering the service and options your clients deserve. Our simple Mortgage Express Program eliminates paperwork hassles and makes offering home lending easier than ever.

Insurance is an integral part of most wealth management strategies. At TFS, we feel that you should be free to choose the offerings that BEST suit your needs and goals — rather than having to push proprietary products or meet sales quotas. Founded in 1968, TFS Insurance Brokerage is a nationally-recognized Master General Agent and Independent Marketing Organization which represents more than 50 carriers for the distribution of Life Insurance, Annuities, Long Term Care Insurance, Disability Insurance, Health Insurance, Employee Benefits, Wellness Programs, and Medicare Supplements. We empower our advisors and offer the tools they need to help you find the options that fit your unique situations.

Our high volume has earned our firm the top contractual arrangements with premier insurance carriers in each of these fields. TFS will deliver comprehensive coverage to our clients at a reasonable cost, while offering our associates the highest level of support and service available in the industry.
