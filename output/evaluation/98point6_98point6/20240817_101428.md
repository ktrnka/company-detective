# About 98point6

98point6 is a Seattle-based health tech company founded on March 1, 2015. The company specializes in providing on-demand virtual care through a text-based platform, combining advanced technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians. Initially, 98point6 operated as a direct virtual primary care provider but has since shifted its focus to licensing its technology to healthcare organizations. This strategic pivot aims to enhance scalability and sustainability in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.

The company generates revenue through a B2B model, licensing its technology to healthcare providers and organizations. It has raised a total of $299 million in venture capital, with significant funding rounds including $118 million in October 2020 and $32 million in April 2023. The company has faced financial challenges, including a decline in digital health funding and a shift in business strategy.

98point6's products are distributed through partnerships with healthcare organizations, allowing them to integrate the company's virtual care platform into their existing systems. The platform is designed to be accessible via a mobile app, providing private, text-based diagnosis and treatment to patients anytime, anywhere.

### Company Overview
