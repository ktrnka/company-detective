# Post ID bg7ip2:  Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-22 [+59 votes]
**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**

*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*

So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.

So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.

So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling "how to get a prescription online."  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.

Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- "This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?"

Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like "well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost."  This lady did not.

This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said "I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable."  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)

I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.

If anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.

That sounds like a great resource! Especially for my two most common ailments, pink eye (I work with kids, they’re gross) and strep. Thanks for sharing

Yeah, it's not a "this solves all your problems" thing, but it might be a "this solves some of your problems this week" thing.

I love children and are they are horrible little germ spreaders.  Wonderful munchkins, terrible pink eye.





## Comment ID eljwrv8 by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):
Sounds like a great service but what i don't understand is, If they cannot prescribe you the medication due to ie; controlled substance etc. Why is she giving you price to purchase it under GoodRX?

Sorry that part wasn't clear to me, I thought you needed a doctor approval to prescribe controlled substances.

### Comment ID eljx9uw by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljwrv8):
So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.

A prescription is for stuff like "the pill" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.

Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.

So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.

Does that make sense?

EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!

#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):
Controlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.

So, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.

That's great!! I will have to keep that service in mind, Thanks for clarifying.

## Comment ID hrmpl3t by MarketWorldly9908 on 2022-01-07 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):
My husband and I have used 98.6 three times. All three times they did not prescribe the needed antibiotic to get better. I had an ear infection, my husband had an ear infection, then I had a sinus infection. We had to wait and get into our family doctor, so we paid 98.6 and our family doctor. I would not recommend them!



## Comment ID elkkysu by NightSkyButterfly on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):
I'm not sure where your old prescription on file is, but I know at the big box pharmacy I used to work at we could send an electronic request to the doctor to write a new script without a visit. Doesn't always work, but worth a try for a med you need!

If it can't, ask your manager about EAP. It can help connect you to some resources, if not a (temporary) counselor.

# Post ID ipmklh:  98point6 PCOS appointment experience! by shortninja29 on 2020-09-09 [+21 votes]
Hi everyone 👋. I had a 98point6 text appointment the other day because it was late and I was frustrated at the scale again lol. For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages. My employer pays for my subscription but I think it's 10$/year for the first year or something. You can talk to a Dr for almost any condition 24/7!

Anyway...I spoke to a Dr and was able to get lab orders done for everything I wanted. (I used my insurance to cover the cost of the various labs) I just had a quick follow-up visit (at my desk at work) to get my results five days later. I finally asked to try metformin extended release (my gyno never gave me) and they sent in the prescription!

Overall it was an awesome experience and I got to avoid long waits and my copay.

## Comment ID g4lctwr by hellokittyunicorn on 2020-09-09 [+1 votes] (in reply to ipmklh):
That’s so fantastic. It seems that appointments with PCOS can be so hit or miss. I’ve been considering trying metformin as well. Just wondering what tests you happened to ask for?

### Comment ID g4mdneb by shortninja29 on 2020-09-10 [+1 votes] (in reply to g4lctwr):
Testosterone, tsh, cbc, kidney function, liver enzymes, dhea, and glucose stuff. Everything came back normal except for testosterone (73) and elevated lymphocytes.

- Reports of a toxic culture, especially after leadership changes, have emerged. "Morale visibly dipped - mine included and a lot of folks from my team all left" [Senior Security Engineer on 2023-05-10](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW76312091.htm).

## Changes Over Time
The company has experienced significant changes, particularly after the departure of key leadership figures, including the CEO. Many employees report a decline in morale and an increase in turnover, with some describing the company as no longer the same as it was a year ago. "It's not at all the same company at it was a year ago" [Software Engineer on 2023-06-21](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm).

## Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction
Employee satisfaction appears to vary significantly by job function, with clinical roles often reporting more dissatisfaction due to leadership issues and perceived inequities. In contrast, technical roles seem to have a more positive outlook, although they also express concerns about management and direction.

## Questions for Leadership
1. What specific steps are being taken to improve leadership effectiveness and employee morale?
2. How does the company plan to address the compensation concerns raised by employees?
3. What initiatives are in place to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion are genuinely practiced within the company?
4. Can you provide clarity on the long-term strategy for the company following recent leadership changes?
5. How does the company plan to improve communication and transparency with employees?
6. What measures are being taken to ensure that all employees feel valued and heard, regardless of their role?

A lot of this has been said

## Pros

Great goals - to improve access and quality of healthcare for all. A desire for diversity.

## Cons

The interview process is your first indication: this is a technical company trying to do everything measurable and data-based. But with the usual problem of humans not being able to understand their biases and produce valid measures. Having interviewed and been interviewed, I've seen both signs.
Then once you get on board, there's a lot to be celebrated (along with celebrations of people and the 'fun' environment). 
However, you soon realize that this is basically another Amazon in disguise. It makes sense when you consider that the CTO and CPO (along with CMO and many others in leadership roles) are ex-Amazonians. There's a complete lack of understanding of how human beings work, which leads to politics, bullying, exclusion and a lack of pyschological safety. If you're part of the in crowd (and you have enough emotional intelligence to realize that you are - and that other people are also valuable) you're golden. You can do and say what you want, and your voice is heard. If not, it's like being the odd kid out on the playground. 
The sad part is that many people want to get feedback and grow, however leadership has proven that they don't hear it - or can't.

## Advice to management

Stop using your background to assess others. Listen to feedback. Ensure that feedback can be given anonymously. Act on it. 
Value all employees, regardless of role. 
Learn emotional intelligence and organizational psychology.

Refusal to Listen to Employees

## Pros

It is extremely rewarding to work for a company with a mission like 98point6. Everyone at the company has this common motiving factor to better healthcare and strive to help people. Additionally the PTO and time-off are better than most companies.

## Cons

Outside of what I have included in the pros, everything else in a con. The biggest two factors are terrible managers and extremely weak pay. I have never worked harder in my career then I did at 98point6 and the company pays extremely low, even for a start-up. People across all departments leave 98point6 for ridiculous compensation increases. Similar to other reviews, it seems like HR refuses to listen to complaints or utilize data to improve known problems. Internal complaints go no where and annual merit increases are a joke. 

About a year into joining, everyone quickly realizes the pros of the company mission are far outweighed by the lack of compensation, tone deaf leadership, and huge work loads. There has been a max exodus from the company for the last couple months in addition to the CEO, CPO, and CTO all departing the company. It does seem like the writing is on the wall and employees are showing their feedback by departing the company since it seems to be the only way to be heard.

Ineffective clinical leadership with boys' club attitude and yes-men mentality

## Pros

The technology is great and it was great to be a part of a company that created an amazing new experience in healthcare. The company was great to work at in the beginning, with strong values and a motivating initial CEO/leader.

## Cons

The clinical side was a mess with poor leadership. 

There are some medical leaders who care only about optics and some who have been promoted without delivered anything successful. There is a command-and-control and boy's club mentality that apparently continues to persist, with senior leaders on the medical side who have no basic management or organization skills creating more confusion and lack of progress. Turf wars impacted real collaboration and progress and, while every every organization has behind the door conversations, you will leave with a sort of PTSD related to that. 

And if you're a female physician or a minority physician, expect to be addressed by your first name, while your white male and military-associated counterparts are often addressed with their titles or a bro-club collegial nickname. Not that you care about titles, but how can you NOT notice inequity?

An amazing and wonderful place

## Pros

the people, the mission, so organized and friendly, on a mission to improve healthcare and behavioral health is valued.

## Cons

Nothing, it is a steep learning curve but fun to learn.

## Advice to management

Nothing so far. Keep this amazing culture going. I think the Meet and Greets are a great idea to build community culture in the virtual world. I'm impressed with the culture, so friendly and respectful.

Wonderful Experience

## Pros

The company is very proactive in making sure their employees are happy and heard. They are very open with the business model. It has been a wonderful experience as a Physician. The medical group collaborates with one another. You definitely feel like you are part of a team from day 1.

## Cons

Training is an adjustment because you are learning the system and there is so much information in a short period of time.

Not many advancement options

## Pros

Great place to work if you want to get deep on a set of problems that has huge human impact.

## Cons

You are somewhat expected to go deep on a problem, and remain the IC expert there permanently. My experience has been that manager changes do not take into account the alignment of that manager's experience and the domain of the team they are taking over.

Not the worst experience, but not great either

## Pros

The benefits offered are on the better end.

## Cons

The management isn’t great- their inexperience in such roles definitely show in really cruddy ways. Micromanagement and shaming is common. There is a clear hierarchy in a negative way with preferential treatment. The company also speak to the idea of being transparent, but it is a facade.

## Advice to management

Get better, more experienced people in the roles, especially in the Behavioral Health sector.

## Pros

Remote work, great co-workers, exciting product. I feel like the company is moving in the right direction. Also, 2 weeks off at the end of the year is fantastic!

## Pros

I worked at 98point6 for 3 years before the clinical operations moved to Transcarent. It was the best 3 years of my 20+ year career. So many opportunities to grow and no micromanagement. I wish 98point6 Tech the best of luck on their future path!

Nice mission, good people but things did change

## Pros

One of the places I was most proud to work at in my longish career, and a really great mission to aspire for and realize.

## Cons

Over time after the CEO was fired and the whole fallout poorly handled, morale visibly dipped - mine included and a lot of folks from my team all left. Eventually I did too.

## Advice to management

Just stay genuine to what you truly believe. Don't say stuff that even you would have a hard time believing but have to say for the sake of keeping morale up. Its been a while since I have left, to be fair - so things may or may not be better now.

Massive Changes and Terrible Communication

## Pros

It used to pay well but there have been a lot of changes and emphasis on frugality. Fully remote work. Some team managers are good people to work for. This doesn't make up for the cons.

## Cons

It's not at all the same company at it was a year ago, but it is pitched as "many new opportunities" and "good problems to have". The well-liked CEO was fired about a year ago a lot of good employees left. Since then the exec level has had multiple reorgs and the healthcare part of the company was sold. Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with "we don't know yet" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.

## Advice to management

There are a lot of things to say but none of them matter because of how leadership behaves.

## News Summary
# Summary of 98point6 Technologies

## Company Overview
98point6 Technologies is a Seattle-based health tech company that specializes in licensed on-demand virtual care software. Founded in 2015, the company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its technology to healthcare providers. The flagship product, the 98point6 Technology Platform, is a cloud-based software solution that integrates artificial intelligence with automated clinical standards to enhance virtual care delivery.

## Key Developments

### Acquisitions
- **Bright.md**: On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which includes 16 customer contracts and the sales and customer success teams. This acquisition is part of a strategy to enhance its asynchronous care capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to communicate with patients at their convenience ([PR Newswire, Jan 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

### Partnerships
- **SteadyMD**: In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution. This collaboration aims to help healthcare organizations manage patient workloads and reduce clinician burnout by combining 98point6's technology with SteadyMD's network of trained clinicians ([SteadyMD, Oct 2023](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)).

### Fundraising and Financials
- In late 2020, 98point6 raised $118 million in funding, which significantly boosted its operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company has faced challenges, including a high-profile leadership shakeup and layoffs in 2022 and 2024, as it transitions to a licensing model ([Pragmatic DLT, Apr 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Business Model Transformation
- The company has shifted from direct healthcare services to a licensing model for its software solutions. This strategic pivot is aimed at achieving more stable and recurring revenue streams while addressing the financial pressures faced by many health tech companies post-pandemic ([Healthcare Dive, Jan 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

## Market Position and User Base
98point6 Technologies has established itself as a leader in the virtual care software market, with its technology being used by numerous healthcare organizations. The company aims to address the growing demand for digital healthcare solutions, as evidenced by a significant increase in patient messages to providers during the pandemic ([Healthcare Dive, Jan 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

## Key Personnel
- **Jay Burrell**: CEO of 98point6 Technologies, who emphasizes the company's commitment to enhancing patient engagement and provider efficiency through innovative technology solutions ([PR Newswire, Jan 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

## Opinions and Challenges
The company has received mixed opinions regarding its transition to a licensing model, with some experts noting that while this could lead to more sustainable growth, it also raises concerns about job security and the impact of layoffs on the local tech ecosystem ([Pragmatic DLT, Apr 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

## Conclusion
98point6 Technologies is navigating a significant transformation in its business model, focusing on licensing its virtual care technology to healthcare providers. With strategic acquisitions and partnerships, the company aims to enhance its offerings and address the evolving needs of the healthcare market.
