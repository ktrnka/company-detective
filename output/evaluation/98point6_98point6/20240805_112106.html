        <p class="about">Notes: 
            We process fewer threads than the search results mainly to save OpenAI costs. Sometimes we also filter search results if there aren't enough comments, or if we detect significant hallucination in the LLM summary of the individual thread.
            The threads are flattened and shortened to fit within the LLM context length. Very deep comment threads may be cut off, as well as very long threads.
            We also filter out comment trees with a negative score.

            <h3>Summary of 98point6 Glassdoor Reviews</h3>
<h4>Key Aspects</h4>
<h5>Leadership</h5>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some reviews highlight a strong leadership team that cares about employees and takes action on feedback (e.g., "Strong leadership team that cares about employees" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW72835871.htm">Anonymous on 2023-01-20</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are reports of inequity in how employees are treated based on gender and race (e.g., "expect to be addressed by your first name, while your white male counterparts are often addressed with their titles" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW62449921.htm">Physician on 2022-04-07</a>)).</li>

<h5>Work-Life Balance</h5>

</ul>
<h5>Growth Opportunities</h5>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities for skill development and deep engagement in impactful problems are noted (e.g., "Great place to work if you want to get deep on a set of problems" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW72835871.htm">Anonymous on 2023-01-20</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h5>Company Culture</h5>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reports of a changing culture, especially after leadership changes, have led to decreased morale (e.g., "morale visibly dipped" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW76312091.htm">Senior Security Engineer on 2023-05-10</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changes Over Time</h4>
<p>The company has experienced significant changes, particularly in leadership and structure. The departure of key executives and subsequent layoffs have led to a decline in employee morale and satisfaction. Many employees feel that the company is no longer the same as it was a year ago, with a shift towards a more toxic environment and a lack of clear direction.</p>
<h4>Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction</h4>
<p>Employee satisfaction appears to vary significantly by job function. While some roles, particularly in clinical and technical areas, report high levels of engagement and fulfillment, others express frustration with management and compensation. The overall sentiment suggests that those in supportive roles or with strong direct management tend to have a better experience.</p>
<h4>Questions for Leadership</h4>
<ol>
<li>What specific steps are being taken to improve leadership effectiveness and emotional intelligence within the management team?</li>
<li>How does the company plan to address the compensation concerns raised by employees?</li>
<li>What initiatives are in place to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the workplace?</li>
<li>Can you provide clarity on the company's long-term strategy and vision following recent leadership changes?</li>
<li>How does the company plan to improve communication and transparency with employees moving forward?</li>
<li>What measures are being implemented to ensure that employee feedback is heard and acted upon?</li>
<li>How does the company plan to support career growth and advancement opportunities for employees?</li>
</ol>
