        <p class="about">Notes: 
            We process fewer threads than the search results mainly to save OpenAI costs. Sometimes we also filter search results if there aren't enough comments, or if we detect significant hallucination in the LLM summary of the individual thread.
            The threads are flattened and shortened to fit within the LLM context length. Very deep comment threads may be cut off, as well as very long threads.
            We also filter out comment trees with a negative score.

- The firing of a well-liked CEO and subsequent layoffs have led to low morale (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW83458845.htm">Software Engineer on 2024-01-17</a>).
- Multiple reorganizations and a toxic atmosphere have been noted (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm">Software Engineer on 2023-06-21</a>).</p>
<h2>Compensation and Benefits</h2>

<h2>Growth Opportunities</h2>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
- Employees feel there is a lack of vision and long-term strategy from leadership, which may hinder growth opportunities (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW86345200.htm">Software Engineer on 2024-04-15</a>).</p>
<h2>Company Culture</h2>

<h2>Changes Over Time</h2>
<p>The company has undergone significant changes, including leadership turnover, layoffs, and a shift in focus that has led to a decline in employee morale and satisfaction. The once positive aspects of the company, such as good pay and a strong culture, have been overshadowed by instability and poor communication.</p>
<h2>Relationship Between Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Job functions appear to correlate with employee satisfaction, as those in supportive roles (like direct managers) tend to have a more positive view of the company. However, dissatisfaction is prevalent among software engineers and other technical roles, likely due to the pressures of leadership changes and lack of clear direction.</p>
<h2>Questions for Leadership</h2>

<li>What specific steps are being taken to improve communication and transparency within the company?</li>
<li>How does the leadership plan to address the concerns regarding diversity and inclusion?</li>
<li>What is the long-term vision for the company, and how do you plan to communicate this to employees?</li>
<li>Can you provide clarity on the compensation structure and the status of promised bonuses?</li>
<li>How do you plan to stabilize the company culture after recent changes and layoffs?</li>
<li>What opportunities for professional development and growth will be available to employees moving forward?</li>
