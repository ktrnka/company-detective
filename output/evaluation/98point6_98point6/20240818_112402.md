# About 98point6

98point6 is a Seattle-based health tech company founded on March 1, 2015. The company specializes in providing on-demand virtual care through a text-based platform, combining advanced technology with the expertise of board-certified physicians to deliver personalized consultation, diagnosis, and treatment to patients. Initially, 98point6 operated as a direct virtual primary care provider but has since shifted its focus to licensing its technology to healthcare organizations. This strategic pivot aims to leverage its proprietary software for scalable and economically sustainable growth in the evolving healthcare landscape.

The company primarily operates on a B2B model, partnering with healthcare organizations to provide its technology platform. Notable partnerships include collaborations with SteadyMD and Baptist Health. As of early 2023, 98point6 had raised a total of $300 million in venture capital, positioning the company for growth and expansion in the competitive healthcare technology market ([Crunchbase, 2024](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6)).
