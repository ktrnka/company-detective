#### Recent Developments
1. **Expansion of Fertility Services**: In April 2024, Maven launched a Trying-To-Conceive (TTC) health coaching program aimed at providing personalized support for couples trying to conceive without IVF. This initiative addresses the significant gap in preconception care, as 86% of women do not receive adequate support from traditional healthcare providers ([PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maven-clinic-expands-award-winning-fertility--family-building-solution-with-focus-on-natural-conception-302118815.html)).

The company has attracted investments from prominent venture capital firms, including General Catalyst, Lux Capital, and Sequoia Capital ([MobiHealthNews](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/maven-clinic-expands-partnership-att-give-employees-fertility-family-benefits)).

#### Return on Investment for Employers
Employers utilizing Maven's services report significant returns on investment, with a 2:1 clinical ROI and a 4:1 business ROI. This is achieved by optimizing natural conception and reducing the need for costly IVF cycles ([PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-from-maven-clinic-spotlights-global-demand-for-fertility-and-family-health-benefits-302061252.html)).
