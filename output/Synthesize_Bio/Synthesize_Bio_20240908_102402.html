            <h1>About Synthesize Bio</h1>
<p>Synthesize Bio is a biotechnology company that focuses on the innovative synthesis of bio-based materials and chemicals, particularly through the utilization of lignin, a complex polymer found in plant cell walls. The company aims to revolutionize the biorefining industry by developing sustainable methods for converting lignin into valuable products, thereby addressing the challenges of biomass utilization and contributing to a greener economy. The company's slogan, "Lignin Matters," reflects its commitment to maximizing the potential of this abundant natural resource <a href="http://english.dicp.cas.cn/news/headline/202405/t20240528_664493.html">(Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Nature, May 29, 2023)</a>.</p>
<h2>Products and Services</h2>
<h3>Primary Product</h3>
<p>Synthesize Bio's primary product involves the synthesis of bio-based materials from lignin through a novel condensation process. This method restructures the condensation reaction pathway to produce high yields of condensed lignin, which can be further processed into benign bisphenols. These compounds have versatile applications, including in the production of plastics and adhesives, serving as potential replacements for fossil-based materials <a href="http://english.dicp.cas.cn/news/headline/202405/t20240528_664493.html">(Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Nature, May 29, 2023)</a>.</p>
