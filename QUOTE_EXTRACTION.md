## Good

- I enjoy the characters and setting
- I found the game to be enjoyable and relaxing
- Cute, stress free game! Love the games color and graphics, design your home, build up your skills (gardening, fishing, mining, hunting, furniture making, cooking etc.) and befriend fellow Palians
- ALL cosmetic items and pets are paid for with real money and are expensive
- I connected with the doctor right away. The physician was super kind and understanding and took care of my needs immediately.
- Great and easy app
- Don't waste your time or money just to be told to go to a clinic in the morning

## Bad

- There are certainly big performance issues that come with it
- The cash shop is pretty toxic, I'm not sure Palia even has nice intentions
- I hope Singularity 6 addresses us about this soon, if we can help I want to start on it as soon as possible
- My e-visit was fantastic
- Great resource for banner employees! Highly recommend
- Thanks for wasting my time

## I/O examples

Input: A lovely game reminds me of the Disney game, with lovely graphics, and music.
Output: ... lovely graphics, and music

Input: even tho i like JUST started playing, and the game seems to be a little broken for me due to me computer not being too great,for what i had been looking for in a game so far, this is actually great it is calming, semi-reakistic in a VERY comfortable way, the farming if fun so far, and hunting deer with bow and arrow is quite fun. the world looks very nice and original, i just love the design of the flowers and plants, and the houses look great, they just feel like home to me. i honestly just hope that this game is going to retain these qualities\

Input: Really relaxed, friendly and helpful community. Lots of quests and goals to work towards. Safe environment for children to play. Slightly buggy sometimes but the game is absolutely free so happy to deal with a few glitches here and there :)

Input: Played it back when it was EA... for one day. I like cozy games, i don't need always high stakes... but the gameplay loop was so insanely boring, only two zones and max. 24 other Players with you on one map. The Story was generic and kinda uninspired. The Crafting was boring... and also the whole game was not what they advertised. The Server Structure back then was bad too. Don't know if they fixed it. I can't describe it better than, if you switched to the second zone or your home, you basically logged out one server and logged in on another server. Basically never meeting the same people again. Edit: Basically i'm amazed they made it that far.

Input: Would really love to actually play this game but either the game itself crashes or it crashes my pc. I can't even get to the main menu before a crash occurs. I've updated all my drivers and pc itself. This is all with a 14th gen i9, 32gb RAM, and an RTX 4070 super. Again, I really want to play this game, I've only ever seen and heard good things about it, but I can barely even get it to boot.
Output: I really want to play this game ..., but I can barely even get it to boot.

Input: You can be as starry eyed and full of hopr, optimism and positivity as you want. If your game isn't fun it's going to fail. Palia is the equivalent of "Thoughts and Prayers". Nice intention, but ultimately meaningless.
Output: If your game isn't fun it's going to fail.

Input: My e-visit was fantastic. I connected with the doctor right away. The physician was super kind and understanding and took care of my needs immediately.

Input: This service is amazing! It has really helped me and my family get the care we need quickly.
Output: It has really helped me and my family get the care we need quickly.

Input: The whole process from setting up the app to getting connected with a doctor was fast and super easy. I love the efficiency and I feel confident I received great attention and care for the reported issue I have. He even ordered the prescription immediately during the correspondence. I love it!

Input: This was amazing. Our daughter took a nasty fall and had a huge lump on her head. We weren’t sure if she had to go to the emergency room. But in talking with the doctor she helped us figure out a care plan and we probably saved hundreds of dollars.

Input: I have chronic migraines- needed a refill of my migraine medication-my normal doctor had a three week waitlist to refill my Rx!! I signed up and in 10 mins (9 actually) had a refill called in by a doctor and now I can’t believe I ever considered waiting to see my doctor - was in so much pain ! This is revolutionary!!
