Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.

Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource!

The well-liked CEO was fired about a year ago a lot of good employees left. Since then the exec level has had multiple reorgs and the healthcare part of the company was sold. Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with \"we don\\'t know yet\" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes.

Software Engineer, 2024-04-15).\\n- The firing of a well-liked CEO and subsequent reorganization has led to low morale and a toxic atmosphere (Software Engineer, 2023-06-21).\\n\\n**Quotations:**\\n- \"Communication overall has been terrible with \\'we don\\'t know yet\\' being the usual answer for any concerns.\" (Software Engineer, 2023-06-21)\\n- \"Exec team doesn\\'t seem to have long term strategy.\" (Software Engineer, 2024-01-17)\\n\\n## Compensation and Benefits\\n**Pros:**\\n- Previously, the company was noted for good pay, but this has changed due to a focus on frugality (Software Engineer, 2023-06-21).\\n\\n**Cons:**\\n- Employees have reported no raises and unfulfilled promises regarding bonuses (Software Development Engineer, 2024-06-11).\\n\\n## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\\n**Cons:**\\n- The company is noted to lack diversity (Backend Software Engineer, 2024-03-13).\\n\\n## Work-Life Balance\\n**Pros:**\\n- Flexible work-from-home policies and good work-life balance are frequently mentioned (Software Engineer, 2024-01-17;

What specific steps are being taken to improve communication and transparency within the company?\\n2. How does the leadership plan to address the concerns regarding diversity and inclusion?\\n3. Can you provide clarity on the company\\'s long-term strategy and vision moving forward?\\n4. What measures are being implemented to ensure employee morale is improved post-layoffs?\\n5. How does the company plan to address the compensation concerns raised by employees?\\n6. What initiatives are in place to foster a more collaborative and less dysfunctional work environment?')"
