If there are any other active forums that someone could point me to that radiologists actually visit, I\\'d be interested as well.\\n\\nSo, my job finally made the mistake of \"upgrading\" to PSOne. I could rant for hours about it and not even scratch the surface. I\\'ve read horror stories on auntminnie and heard from other radiologists about PSOne, but I was actually impressed to see that it was actually even worse in practice than everyone was saying. I mean -- they eliminated keyboard shortcuts, the UI is disastrous, you need 5-6 extra clicks to do anything you could do in PS360, the macro and report editor is schizophrenic, adding random spaces, new lines, deleting them to the point that it honestly feels like a psychological experiment someone is playing on me, everything requires switching tabs now, you can\\'t pull up the order page without it taking up half the screen, etc.\\n\\nNow, the one fucking thing that continues to drive me insane 50 times a day is -- clicking at the end of a sentence or anywhere after it (it seems this mostly happens in impression fields, since for some reason in the findings section it works normally, although just like everything in PSOne it is totally inconsistent behavior and sometimes does it, sometimes no), will put your cursor BEFORE the punctuation mark. So anything you say will just be added to the end of the last sentence BEFORE the period, completely fucking up your report. The only way to fix this is, no matter where you click, you then have to press right arrow to get to after the period. How the FUCKKKKKKK was this missed in testing? Like, how the fuck are we supposed to dictate?\\n\\nHas ANYONE found a solution for this behavior? I am wondering if like, maybe you need some kind of special impression field, some formatting, who the fuck knows. I also wouldn\\'t be surprised if other people using PSOne don\\'t experience this, because the software is THAT fucking inconsistent.\\n\\nAny ideas?\\n\\n## Comment ID kc7nmgx by MocoMojo on 2023-12-06 [+8 votes] (in reply to 18bymqt):\\nIt’s horrible. \\n\\nIn addition, our PACS (Visage) now crashes 2-4 times a day (the is never happened with PS360).\\n\\n### Comment ID kc7qy0x by tell_her_a_story on 2023-12-06 [+3 votes] (in reply to kc7nmgx):\\nWe\\'re running Sectra with PS One, seeing at least 4 crashes per day on average.

There is PSOne core version (looks and feels like PS360, but updated engine), and the PSOne UX version (the ‘new’ powerscribe with new UI and bells and whistles that they show at RSNA and has gotten the bad reviews). \\n\\nWe need to upgrade from 360 and have choice between PSOne Core and UX. Am told by vendor that new UX version received a service patch in last few months and has now been getting good reviews, with a lot of the issues discussed in this thread being fixed. Have held off on upgrading for over 2 years given all the bad reviews and budget, but now need to for technical reasons.

Wondering have they updated you to the new service pack (came out earlier this year) since you started with the new UI? Nuance has told us the initial new UI version was bad for many of the reasons you mentioned (which means it must have been very bad for the company to take ownership of it) but has now been fixed.

Am told by vendor that new UX version received a service patch in last few months and has now been getting good reviews, with a lot of the issues discussed in this thread being fixed.

(Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women\\'s work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It\\'s been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn\\'t like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don\\'t think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn\\'t possible to bring up concerns.', 'consOriginal': None, 'countHelpful': 27, 'countNotHelpful': 0, 'employer': {'__typename': 'Employer', 'id': 3543079, 'shortName': 'Rad AI', 'firstNotReassignedEmployerId': 3543079, 'activeStatus': 'ACTIVE', 'approvalStatus': 'APPROVED', 'headquarters': 'San Francisco, CA', 'size': '51 to 200 Employees', 'bestProfile': {'__typename': 'EmployerProfile', 'id': 1797535, 'rowProfile': False}, 'restOfWorldProfile': {'__typename': 'EmployerProfile', 'id': 8793387}, 'primaryIndustry': {'__typename': 'EmployerIndustry', 'industryId': 200059, 'industryName': 'Health Care Services & Hospitals', 'sectorId': 10012, 'sectorName': 'Healthcare'}, 'legalActionBadges': [], 'employerManagedContent({\"parameters\":[{\"employerId\":3543079}]})': [{'__typename': 'EmployerManagedContent', 'isContentPaidForTld': False}], 'squareLogoUrl': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/3543079/rad-ai-squareLogo-1617931435350.png', 'website': 'https://www.radai.com', 'squareLogoUrl({\"size\":\"LARGE\"})': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/3543079/rad-ai-squareLogo-1617931435486.png', 'squareLogoUrl({\"size\":\"REGULAR\"})': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/3543079/rad-ai-squareLogo-1617931435350.png', 'bestPlacesToWork({\"onlyCurrent\":true})': [], 'bestLedCompanies({\"onlyCurrent\":true})': [], 'coverPhoto': {'__typename': 'EmployerCoverPhoto', 'hiResUrl': None}, 'counts': {'__typename': 'EmployerCounts', 'benefitCount': 5, 'globalJobCount': {'__typename': 'EmployerJobCountHolder', 'jobCount': 16}, 'interviewCount': 11, 'photoCount': None, 'reviewCount': 13, 'salaryCount': 32}, 'employerManagedContent({\"parameters\":[{\"divisionProfileId\":1797535,\"employerId\":3543079}]})': [{'__typename': 'EmployerManagedContent', 'employerId': 3543079, 'divisionProfileId': 1797535, 'featuredVideoLink': None, 'isContentPaidForTld': False, 'profileCoverPhoto': None, 'diversityContent': {'__typename': 'DiversityAndInclusionContent', 'programsAndInitiatives': None}}], 'requirementsComplete': False, 'links': {'__typename': 'EiEmployerLinks', 'benefitsUrl': '/Benefits/Rad-AI-Benefits-E3543079.htm', 'faqUrl': '/FAQ/Rad-AI-Questions-E3543079.htm', 'interviewUrl': '/Interview/Rad-AI-Interview-Questions-E3543079.htm', 'jobsUrl': '/Jobs/Rad-AI-Jobs-E3543079.htm', 'locationsUrl': '/Location/All-Rad-AI-Office-Locations-E3543079.htm', 'orgStructureUrl': '/Affiliated/Rad-AI-Companies-E3543079.htm', 'overviewUrl': '/Overview/Working-at-Rad-AI-EI_IE3543079.11,17.htm', 'photosUrl': '/Photos/Rad-AI-Office-Photos-E3543079.htm', 'reviewsUrl': '/Reviews/Rad-AI-Reviews-E3543079.htm', 'salariesUrl': '/Salary/Rad-AI-Salaries-E3543079.htm'}, 'officeAddresses': [], 'parent': None, 'ratings': {'__typename': 'DefaultEmployerRatings', 'diversityAndInclusionRatingCount': 7}, 'subsidiaries': []}, 'employerResponses': [], 'employmentStatus': 'REGULAR', 'flaggingDisabled': None, 'featured': False, 'isCurrentJob': True, 'jobTitle': None, 'languageId': 'eng', 'lengthOfEmployment': 2, 'location': None, 'originalLanguageId': None, 'pros': \"Co-Founders are wonderful.

Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after.
