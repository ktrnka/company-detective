Just under 50 developers, around one third of the company, have been let go according to Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter.Environmental artist Daphne Fiato tweeted \"Whelp, I\\'ve been laid off,\" following up with \"49 people Thanos snapped\". Other Singularity 6 folk joined to reveal they\\'d also been laid off, including Brian Ernst who tweeted they\\'d been with the developer for five years. One developer revealed via LinkedIn that they\\'d been given the news while on vacation, according to MMORPG.com.Singularity 6 is yet to publicly address the layoffs, with its last Twitter post happening on April 3, one day before they occurred. It\\'s the same situation for the official Palia account.\\xa0Palia only just arrived on Steam on March 25, following a stint as an Epic exclusive. The free-to-play MMO has generated some praise for its cosy vibes and its stress-free cycle of farming and building, but it\\'s also been criticised for its slow progression, reliance on timers and limited multiplayer elements. Its development status has also led to some confusion—it\\'s not in early access, and the store page implies a feature-complete game, when in reality it is still in beta. On Steam, it\\'s currently sitting at just over 3,700 user reviews with a \"Mixed\" rating.\\xa0The studio joins a painfully long line of developers to have nixed a portion of its staff this year. Despite only being four months into the year, the number of layoffs are close to reaching last year\\'s count. It was estimated that around 10,500 developers lost their jobs last year, according to the Game Industry Layoffs tracker. The number is already up to around 8000 estimated job losses right now, with more undoubtedly on their way given the volatility of the industry.We compiled our own layoff chart earlier this year, showing the trajectory of 16,000 layoffs from January 2023 to January 2024. Since the chart was published, companies like Relic, Certain Affinity, Sony and Blackbird Interactive have joined the list.\\xa0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\n\\nMollie TaylorSocial Links NavigationFeatures ProducerMollie spent her early childhood deeply invested in games like Killer Instinct, Toontown and Audition Online, which continue to form the pillars of her personality today.

The studio has recently faced significant challenges, including layoffs affecting approximately one-third of its workforce, totaling around 49 employees. This situation reflects broader trends in the gaming industry, where layoffs have been prevalent, with an estimated 8,000 job losses reported in early 2024 alone ([PC Gamer, April 2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).\\n\\n## Product Information: Palia\\n**Palia** is a free-to-play MMO that emphasizes a relaxed gaming experience, focusing on farming and building mechanics. The game was released on Steam on March 25, 2024, after a period of exclusivity on the Epic Games Store. Despite its positive reception for its \"cosy vibes,\" Palia has faced criticism for its slow progression, reliance on timers, and limited multiplayer features. As of now, it holds a \"Mixed\" rating on Steam, with over 3,700 user reviews ([PC Gamer, April 2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).\\n\\n### Development Status\\nPalia is currently in beta, which has led to some confusion among players regarding its development status. The game\\'s store page suggests it is feature-complete, but it is still undergoing updates and improvements ([PC Gamer, April 2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).\\n\\n## Key Personnel\\nWhile specific names of key personnel were not mentioned in the articles, the layoffs included long-term employees, indicating a significant restructuring within the company. Notably, environmental artist Daphne Fiato and developer Brian Ernst publicly shared their experiences regarding the layoffs on social media ([PC Gamer, April 2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).\\n\\n## Industry Context\\nThe gaming industry is currently experiencing a wave of layoffs, with Singularity 6 being one of many studios affected. The trend has raised concerns about job security within the sector, as the number of layoffs in 2024 is on track to match or exceed the previous year\\'s total of approximately 10,500 job losses ([PC Gamer, April 2024](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).\\n\\n## Community Engagement\\nSingularity 6 has been active in communicating with its community through updates and dev blogs, although the latest posts were made prior to the layoffs. The company appears to be focused on maintaining a connection with its player base as it navigates these challenges ([Palia, August 2024](https://palia.com/news/patch-177)).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nFor prospective candidates or investors, Singularity 6 presents a mixed picture. While Palia has carved out a niche in the cozy MMO genre, the recent layoffs and industry volatility raise questions about the company\\'s stability and future direction. The ongoing development of Palia and its community engagement efforts may offer potential for recovery and growth, but caution is advised given the current landscape of the gaming industry.')"

It\\'s the same situation for the official Palia account.\\xa0Palia only just arrived on Steam on March 25, following a stint as an Epic exclusive. The free-to-play MMO has generated some praise for its cosy vibes and its stress-free cycle of farming and building, but it\\'s also been criticised for its slow progression, reliance on timers and limited multiplayer elements. Its development status has also led to some confusion—it\\'s not in early access, and the store page implies a feature-complete game, when in reality it is still in beta. On Steam, it\\'s currently sitting at just over 3,700 user reviews with a \"Mixed\" rating.\\xa0The studio joins a painfully long line of developers to have nixed a portion of its staff this year. Despite only being four months into the year, the number of layoffs are close to reaching last year\\'s count. It was estimated that around 10,500 developers lost their jobs last year, according to the Game Industry Layoffs tracker. The number is already up to around 8000 estimated job losses right now, with more undoubtedly on their way given the volatility of the industry.We compiled our own layoff chart earlier this year, showing the trajectory of 16,000 layoffs from January 2023 to January 2024. Since the chart was published, companies like Relic, Certain Affinity, Sony and Blackbird Interactive have joined the list.\\xa0The biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware dealsKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\n\\nMollie TaylorSocial Links NavigationFeatures ProducerMollie spent her early childhood deeply invested in games like Killer Instinct, Toontown and Audition Online, which continue to form the pillars of her personality today.
