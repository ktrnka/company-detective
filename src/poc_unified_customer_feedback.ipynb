       "\"# Thumbs Up [(Anonymous, Steam, 2024-07-23)](https://steam/76561199201971173)\\nI have been playing since Open Beta started last August, longer than I have been playing on Steam. There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. \\r\\n1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\\r\\n2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\\r\\n3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\\r\\n4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\\r\\n5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\\r\\n6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \\r\\n7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \\r\\n8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \\r\\n9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \\r\\n10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\\r\\n11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\\r\\n12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\\r\\n13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \\r\\n14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \\r\\n15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \\r\\n16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\\r\\n17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\\r\\n18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \\r\\n19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\\r\\n20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\\r\\n21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!\""
