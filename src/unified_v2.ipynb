      "Ex-Rippling here. I hope you took the interview to feel it out while doing your due diligence.  Glassdoor reviews are hit or miss and the way I look at it is consistency over time. There’s a lot of recurring themes over the course of 2+ years, and I’m sure you can figure that out. Also, there’s an influx of 30+ 5 star reviews during the last 3 weeks. Coincidence? I think not.  Executive leadership and HR have been pushing folks to spam positive reviews to try and turn their reputation around. Check Blind and you’ll see the same themes (poor WLB, lack of culture, poor leadership, etc).\n",

      "I'd say the biggest things are first, I like to do a lot of repetitive stuff in Powershell.  I walked in to a LOT of cleanup tasks that had been ignored for... as far as I can the life of the company.  Employees who had been gone for up to 18 months still had active M365 licenses with mailboxes, just disabled accounts.   My first instinct is to fire up Powershell to do the compliance searches and exports.   Rippling gets in the way though at login.  Like it's not passing the authentication request over to Rippling or something, so I'm dead in the water.  If I quick-fix turn off federation in Rippling, start my shell, then turn it back on, it works.   Not the end of the world but dammit, I hate having to jump through hoops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second pain point, when a user hits [www.office.com](http://www.office.com) and logs in, it sends them to Rippling to authenticate.  Now normally this happens pretty quick, but sometimes it hangs there for a moment, and the user sees that Rippling is authenticating their PERSONAL email address.  This is just how it works, but it almost always leads to a call to the Service Desk asking what that was all about, and if I can now read their gmail and shit.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, and I haven't actually bounced this one off Rippling yet, I don't see any way to tell Rippling that it's OK, I don't WANT to use their IdP, and instead have it authenticate against EntraID.  I really want to use a lot of the neat conditional access policies in Entra, but with Rippling in the way they just don't work.     \n",

      "Oh, and because I'm IT and not HR, I can't add/remove/change accounts in Rippling itself.  Our HR person has to do that.  Well, our HR person left a few weeks ago and the finance director took over that role.  They're not always the greatest about timely terminations, so things don't always get kicked off as soon as they should.  I tend to kill most accounts before Rippling gets started, but at least once a week the CEO asks ME why someone is still active in Rippling, when I can't do much about it.   (That could be solved by just giving me control of the whole thing, so not a HUGE gripe at rippling)\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and sorta on that topic, because it's the payroll system, terminated people still have access to log in and see their information, tax forms, etc.  I get that, and totally agree it should be that way, but... same CEO occasionally pops into the Activity Log and sees people he fired for theft/fraud/reallyBadReasons and flips his shit.   I've pretty much got him trained to look for the lack of a MS icon on their login, thus showing they were logging into Rippling only, but still, he's not that uncommon of a CEO.  I know I flipped my shit the first time I saw those people before digging deeper.   Would be nice to keep terminated employees into a separate activity log or something.  \n",

It's MDM and policy/compliance feature is a bit basic compared to Intune or something, but it does the job, and their warehouse/shipping thing is actually AWESOME.   I click two or three buttons and a new PC is sent to you.  I click two or three more and a box is sent to you to ship it back.   It goes to some warehouse somewhere where someone ELSE images it and does whatever.   Normally I wouldn't mind doing that stuff myself, but you know how it is, when shit gets busy, archiving and imaging older laptops falls to the side.   The finance/HR side of things seems to be pretty decent as well, but I don't see a lot of that.  I know the previous HR was shall we say \"challenged\" and even he was able to onboard me without any obvious hassle, so it can't be that bad.

      "Are you sure they literally require you to? Or it’s just recommended since the default is to move the processing date back one day if it falls on a bank holiday? You’re still processing well enough in advance if you were to process Tuesday in this case. My company gives clients the choice if they want to move back or forward, but back is the default. As long as they process 48 business hours before check date that’s all that matters. Bear in mind I’m not familiar with Rippling but I deal with most other bureaus on a regular basis and some of them even allow you to submit with 24 hours notice. Edit…I’m off this week so I forgot Tuesday was the holiday….so in this case you should have been able to process Monday anyway….seems dumb they would charge a late fee.\n",

      "(I'm not sure if any of these chat comments are overlapping, but for clarification - our work week ends at 8pm on Friday night, which is the cutoff for our contractors to submit work completed.   Submitted work needs to be inspected and approved, which is always completed by Saturday morning.)  \n",

      "I was originally with another payroll processor, who I absolutely enjoyed working with, but Rippling offered some automation features that I thought would help our business (like having onboarding contractors electronically sign documents and submit license / insurance information.

    "You seek to understand the authors to better interpret and debias their information by considering their background, affiliations, and potential motivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing product quality:\n",
    "- Companies typically exaggerate the positive aspects of their products and hide the negative aspects. Hence, you treat company statements about product quality with skepticism and seek corroborating evidence from independent sources.\n",
    "- Reddit tends to be polarized, often oversampling strong opinions, particularly negative ones. Therefore, you interpret feedback on Reddit by looking for patterns across multiple comments and considering the context of each comment to identify more balanced views.\n",
    "\n",
    "You review a wide range of sources to get a comprehensive view that's less susceptible to individual biases. You also consider the reliability of each source with respect to the type of information it provides. For example:\n",

Including dates in citations is crucial because:\n",
    "- The date is a key factor in determining relevance. For example, very positive but older sentiment about a company may not indicate much about its current state.\n",
    "- Certain key details about companies and products can change drastically over time, so noting the general timeframe is crucial for accuracy. For instance, a company may have had 300 employees in 2021 but only 20 employees in 2024. Including the date provides essential context for such information.\n",

    "You keep facts and opinions clearly separated but share both with your audience to provide a well-rounded perspective.
