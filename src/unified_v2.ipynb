      "Palia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. \n",

      "Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\n",

But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.

If they are tightening the belt for financial reasons, it does not bode well for future development.\n",

Theres also the option to create an outfit customizer that-allows you to say, pay 1$ more for the blue option of the sunglasses that cost 1.50$.

      "You have some legitimate criticism but I'd like to point out some things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Working for big game studios doesn't mean as much as you think.  If they were just junior devs they didn't make any decisions and just did what they were told to.  For all we know most of them worked just on UI.  I would say they are beginners to making a full game but being beginners isn't an excuse people should be using anyway.\n",
      "2. We don't really know how many FT permanent employees they have.  You can pull up numbers from many websites but those numbers will most likely include contractors who just did temporary work like VO or concept art.\n",
      "3. The budget part is interesting to be honest but I can't make a judgement on the money situation unless I see financial statements.  Maybe they're actually a company that pays their employees really well and gives great benefits.  If they pay 10 employees 100k a year that's 1 million USD just for those employees wages for one year and if they really have over 100 full time perminent employees they could be spending upwards of 10M a year on wages and benefits.  The point is that 50M doesn't go that far in this economy.  Especially when that's what's made over 5 years.  \n",
      "4. Many, many games go into beta (even release) missing secondary features like FFXIV 2.0 for example.  I'm willing to give them a bit of a break on this.  Mostly because the NPC content currently in the game is massive even if the story and map isn't.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I think what we should push for is public financial statements more than a roadmap.  Singularity 6 isn't publicly traded so public financial statements aren't required but I think it would do good for the community to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said I was disappointed in the patch yesterday but I personally realize it's only been 2 weeks since Closed Beta launch and not even a week since Open Beta started.  I'm personally going to give them some more time because they can't just shift what they were doing suddenly based on feedback.  Changes take time.  Coding/development takes time.\n",

Some will use indie to mean not a major studio with many games under their belt will some will use it to mean only small studios that fit that criteria.  It's the same in music.  I think the semantics of indie, and MMO, decrease the legitimacy of feedback though.  And I mean that for \"both sides\".  \n",

      "4. Eh.  I think release will be December and I don't see that as close.  They also are talking about having content patches every two weeks with bug fixes in-between.

      "I asked this before because the $50 million number always confused me and I couldn't find any clarification. Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead. Also how did COVID lockdowns affect development?\n",

Currently, their monetization feels predatory partly because of how closely it feels to all those other instances of games whose sole existence was to become a cash grab.

Taking away that feature would’ve lost them a ton of players as deeds(the activity that earns the store currency) are a very popular thing for many veteran players to work on once they’ve completed the current end game raids and dungeons. Essentially, the MMO saying “the true end game is fashion” is very much based in reality for LOTRO.

      "Honestly I can't see the problem with the palcats. It's purely cosmetic, it doesn't give any boost, so why are people so outraged? Because developers who are working so hard on a F2P HUGE MMO (for an indie dev) dare ask for money? Servers cost money. Work costs money. People who say they're gonna stop playing because they can't have a free cosmetic sound really entitled to me tbh the only thing they put behind paywall is cosmetic, which makes sense, since they need money to keep the game up. \"Playing our game isn't good enough\" as if we're doing them a favour by playing a game they're pouring so much work in.\n",

If they were making plenty off of people buying the clothing and just wanting to support the company, there wouldn’t have been layoffs. It sucks, but there’s a reason MMOs don’t follow this monetization model, and it’s not JUST corporate greed. I’d honestly prefer to see this than the alternative, where the game just shuts down entirely and everyone who worked on it is out of a job.\n",

I trust his judgement on this because all I am seeing is folks getting their underwear twisted over how the company choose to fund the work on the game. Frankly we are lucky to have had a free game which hasnt had anything but skins behind a paywall. So how about a bit of positivity and hope instead? S6 have as far as I can tell in the 4 months of playing, given players practically everything they could do within the game mechanics as it stands.  Wanted plushies? you got them.. wanted trees? got them, wanted flow trees on your plot? you got them! Wanted hotpot back? we got it! Bigger houses? got that too....! S6 have listened and delivered where they can. So enough whining and moaning about their partnership with an established game provider, they can rehire, and hopefully we will see the fruits of this soon! If you dont want to buy into stuff then dont but if you are going to moan about a FREE to play game that is still currently in dev mode then you really need to find something else to do with your life.   \n",

      "To be frank, this is a hope for the best and prepare for the worst scenario and unfortunately Daybreak isn't known for it's great monetization model and it tends to push it hard on any game studio it acquires. They are pretty much the exact opposite of what S6 was about when it comes to monetization. The fact S6 was even open to an acquisition in the first place isn't a good sign but if you couple that with them actually going through with it with such a publisher speaks volumes. This one line from the official acquisition statement says it all.\n",

Secondly, any time a company mentions 2 things under the same context you should always read them separately like this.\n",

      "\n",
      "Read that last one about players and what does it sound like to you? I'll spell it out for you just in case...we are the product, not the game. They have invested in a new player base that is outside there normal target audience. Whether this is good or bad will remain to be seen but they have an expectation of a return on that investment and with a game like Palia that could be tricky. It costs more to create something new then it does to place artificial limitations on us and people are far more likely to spend money on a better experience then on a prettier one. So like I originally said, hope for the best but prepare for the worst because the odds are not in our favor here by a long shot and it really pains me because I love this game.\n",

      "This DOES have a bright side to it. Investment from a bigger company can be a really good thing. Most of the games under Daydreams publishing are actually good games if you ignore the monetization factor. The world building and lore behind most of them are top notch, but the story writing tends to be a little lack luster. S6 however has great writing and a LOT of lore and world elements to build upon so with Daydreams backing Palia has a lot going for it in a good way.\n",

      "A: This is a fair point - and the cross section of cozy and nerfing is something we’re seeing more of as we’ve gone into Beta. Our goal with balance changes to date have primarily been to address large outliers - this unfortunately comes with players feeling like their way of play is no longer viable.

      "On the topic of multiplayer events, it would be cool to add more cooperative events rather than competitive. For example, the mini game rounding up the chapaas is fun, but it inherently puts the players in opposition to each other (ie, the more tickets others get, the less I get)\n",

      "An alternative would be something like releasing 100 chapaas at once and the players have to round them up within a time limit.

      "This is one of the challenges of blending the community sim genre and bringing multiplayer, always online components to the game. In most other community sim games that are offline, players' ability to acquire money grows exponentially, resulting in effectively unlimited currency, and removes any decision making around that friction point at some point in the game. At that point - I imagine most players stop playing and maybe restart (I know I do).   \n",

      "For a live service game that we want to last for years on end - we felt it was important to maintain the value of our currencies over time. The gold cap is one method of keeping the overall economy in range. When we set the current gold cap amount - we based it on earlier Alpha test engagement and earning rates. What we’ve seen since Beta launch is how much both the median player and higher earning players are actually gaining - players are playing both longer and earning more gold than we anticipated with the 300k limit.

      "A: The free outfit options we currently have are what will be available for now. If we add more free clothing in the future, we expect that all players will be able to get them, and there won’t be craftable outfits. Keeping cosmetics paid is how we plan on supporting Palia financially, and until we learn a lot more about how that’s working we can’t commit to more free outfits.

      "The truest answer to your question is: we use a premium currency because we don’t really have a choice if we want Palia to be cross-platform (which we do).  \n",
      "Each platform that we want to have Palia on has its own technical and business limitations on real money purchases, and the combination of all of them would make it essentially impossible to operate a premium store. If outfits were purchased for real money instead of Palia Coins, we would be limited in how many outfits we could offer, we would have minimal options in how we could provide discounts, you might not be able to use your outfits across all platforms, and a ton of other limitations.\n",

      "A: I can, but I know it won’t be a very satisfying explanation to many of you. We actually had the plan to give a prototype of pets (ie Palcats) to early purchasers for a very long time - since even before a single player ever logged into Palia (and well before the project was even called Palia FWIW). A version of it was actually originally slated for our first Alpha test but we cut it to work on some critical systems that had fallen behind and needed priority. The long and short of it is that it is a thank you to people willing to purchase early, but I want to be upfront that it’s also an important purchase incentive. We think that for a new game it’s really important that the first purchases people make are overloaded with value, and pets were our best option. - WizardCrab\n",

      "In general - our guiding principle is allowing you to play the game you want to play - we want players to feel like they have a reasonable path to earning gold and unlocking parts of the game by engaging in activities they enjoy. When we see one activity start to be notably better than others, it creates a pressure on a lot of players to start doing that activity or they will feel like they're being left behind.On the tomato seed front, we started to see those pop up as a high income generating item and that led us to investigate why, and in that investigation we realized that the timer was set incorrectly in the game. The rate that players started to sell tomato seeds over other seeds was a signal for us to investigate. That investigation exposed an error that simply made tomatoes the only crop you should be planting if you're trying to make money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cake parties on the other hand are awesome and an activity we very much want to preserve, but they are generating too much income right now. We intentionally designed cooking around being a multiplayer activity, and wanted to encourage players to play in ways like this. Given the high cost to organize a cake party, we think it’s ok for this to be one of the best, if not the best value generating activity in the game. We’re discussing options to bring the income earned down while preserving the overall benefit of this activity and will share when we have a path forward. Long term, the better solution is adding more dishes of this complexity to ensure players aren’t just making celebration cakes at these parties, but other dishes and multiplayer activities as well. - Forseti\n",

      "Thank you for this answer, Forseti. I do want to say though that the only real block I've found in progressing through the story is actually gold. I never have enough to buy all the \"Fine\" tool recipes and such, much less to expand my house the way I want. And without those better tools, I have trouble with certain quests--take, for example, the difficulty of catching a Void Ray with the Standard Rod, which I need to pass the first Night Sky bundle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admittedly, I was one of the people who made mad money off of tomatoes--I thought the pricing/timer was intentional, though. There aren't nearly enough ways to make gold in the game given how reliant the story is on gold, and so it bothers me that tomatoes were nerfed without providing another option. Especially since this update included a fresh gold sink in the form of wildly expensive Maji Market items.\n",

      "Why not buff other ways to make money rather than continuously nerfing ways the community finds to earn it? Everything costs SO much (60k for a maji plushi?!) it doesn't feel like there are any ways to earn the income without spending 24/7 on the game UNLESS you do cake parties. To me that signifies that there's something wrong not with how much cake parties earn, but how little everything else does.\n",

      "Respectfully, I disagree with the reasoning given for the tomato seed nerfing. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) “Our guiding principle is allowing you to play the game you want to play”, but nerfing a process that many enjoy and have modeled their routine around is in fact forcing us to change the way that we play, even if it’s not how we want to play. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) The pressure to make a tomato farm wasn’t really an issue in my opinion based on talking with other players, but since that’s subjective I’d ignore that, except now those of us who were making money through the tomato seeds and not cake parties now feel pressured to do cake parties. Not everyone has the time or honestly the mental capacity that those take. I like logging on and watering my tomatoes and being chill and cozy, having to go to a huge party where there’s a list of rules to follow, roles assigned, pressure to cook the right things, and on top of that needing to either organize it or find one that has an open slot with items that you are able to provide. It’s great for those who want to do it, but now the pressure that you were referring too is increased ten fold to do the only alternative you’ve left. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) If the issue you found was the timer was wrong, then why would the solution be to DECREASE the timer and cost an additional tomato rather than just increase the timer. It seems there was never an error in the first place if that was the solution and the timer was an excuse to nerf the seed profits with cause, making it seem like it was always supposed to be that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The money was honestly such a non issue, so I don’t get why it needs nerfing in the first place. There are so many things to do and buy, especially if events are going to have limited time items, that being able to afford the things is motivating to keep playing and saving for the things you want to buy or the vision you have for your house. Having earnings nerfed for anything and taking longer and longer to buy the things that get more and more expensive is very demotivating to continue gameplay. \n",

      "Hope this input helps as I’d love to continue the gameplay I was enjoying!\n",

They absolutely pay attention to social media, probably more so than individual complaints/requests. If a topic is getting a lot of traction publicly, they are more likely to address it.

      "Not surprised considering the game isn't monetized at all except for some clothing. It's refreshing, but obviously isn't making enough money. A low spender like me isn't gonna pay $20 for a single outfit, and high spenders don't have much to buy either. Surprised they don't have more pets or any furniture in the cash shop. Hell, the community has been begging for mounts, which would do great in a shop too.\n",

      "This was immediately clear to me when I played during testing (they had cash shop purchases available even then). I found the prices exorbitant for what was being offered and that's a major turn-off. As such, I decided to stop playing because I didn't enjoy being presented with amazing and interesting outfits on other players while I run around in the starter rags, but also finding those amazing and interesting outfits to be out of my justifiable purchase range.\n",

      "My take on it is that I would have no problem with cosmetics being monetised in the store if there was also some way of earning extra cosmetics in game. What I am thinking, based on another game I play, is them having Festivals or huge community events with specific quests that reward new items of clothing, but they are limited to that event. That way, there is some chance for people to change up their look if they find the store pricing too excessive, and it incentivises people to log in for those events. I also think that they need to offer every outfit (or ever 1/3 of an outfit, since they basically offer the same thing 3 times....) in ALL colour combinations. Paying 1200ish coins for one cosmetic, but it only coming in 3 colour swatches, is ridiculous. I would happily pay that for one outfit that I really liked if I knew it came in all the colour swatches they offer.\n",
