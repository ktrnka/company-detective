      "Palia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence.

      "Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\n",

Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  \n",

      "When Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n",

I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n",

Especially in a new studio, newly formed team that literally doubled in size multiple times over the last 3-4 years.

      "You have some legitimate criticism but I'd like to point out some things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Working for big game studios doesn't mean as much as you think.  If they were just junior devs they didn't make any decisions and just did what they were told to.  For all we know most of them worked just on UI.  I would say they are beginners to making a full game but being beginners isn't an excuse people should be using anyway.\n",
      "2. We don't really know how many FT permanent employees they have.  You can pull up numbers from many websites but those numbers will most likely include contractors who just did temporary work like VO or concept art.\n",
      "3. The budget part is interesting to be honest but I can't make a judgement on the money situation unless I see financial statements.  Maybe they're actually a company that pays their employees really well and gives great benefits.  If they pay 10 employees 100k a year that's 1 million USD just for those employees wages for one year and if they really have over 100 full time perminent employees they could be spending upwards of 10M a year on wages and benefits.  The point is that 50M doesn't go that far in this economy.  Especially when that's what's made over 5 years.  \n",
      "4. Many, many games go into beta (even release) missing secondary features like FFXIV 2.0 for example.  I'm willing to give them a bit of a break on this.  Mostly because the NPC content currently in the game is massive even if the story and map isn't.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I think what we should push for is public financial statements more than a roadmap.  Singularity 6 isn't publicly traded so public financial statements aren't required but I think it would do good for the community to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said I was disappointed in the patch yesterday but I personally realize it's only been 2 weeks since Closed Beta launch and not even a week since Open Beta started.  I'm personally going to give them some more time because they can't just shift what they were doing suddenly based on feedback.  Changes take time.  Coding/development takes time.\n",

Some will use indie to mean not a major studio with many games under their belt will some will use it to mean only small studios that fit that criteria.  It's the same in music.  I think the semantics of indie, and MMO, decrease the legitimacy of feedback though.  And I mean that for \"both sides\".  \n",

      "4. Eh.  I think release will be December and I don't see that as close.  They also are talking about having content patches every two weeks with bug fixes in-between.

I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious.

Currently, their monetization feels predatory partly because of how closely it feels to all those other instances of games whose sole existence was to become a cash grab.

If they are tightening the belt for financial reasons, it does not bode well for future development.\n",

Theres also the option to create an outfit customizer that-allows you to say, pay 1$ more for the blue option of the sunglasses that cost 1.50$.

      "Palia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence.

      "Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\n",

      "When Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.\n",

      "I get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.\n",

But that trust has been getting worn, and they needed to be more proactive with addressing specific concerns before that trust got completely broken.

      "You have some legitimate criticism but I'd like to point out some things.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Working for big game studios doesn't mean as much as you think.  If they were just junior devs they didn't make any decisions and just did what they were told to.  For all we know most of them worked just on UI.  I would say they are beginners to making a full game but being beginners isn't an excuse people should be using anyway.\n",
      "2. We don't really know how many FT permanent employees they have.  You can pull up numbers from many websites but those numbers will most likely include contractors who just did temporary work like VO or concept art.\n",
      "3. The budget part is interesting to be honest but I can't make a judgement on the money situation unless I see financial statements.  Maybe they're actually a company that pays their employees really well and gives great benefits.  If they pay 10 employees 100k a year that's 1 million USD just for those employees wages for one year and if they really have over 100 full time perminent employees they could be spending upwards of 10M a year on wages and benefits.  The point is that 50M doesn't go that far in this economy.  Especially when that's what's made over 5 years.  \n",
      "4. Many, many games go into beta (even release) missing secondary features like FFXIV 2.0 for example.  I'm willing to give them a bit of a break on this.  Mostly because the NPC content currently in the game is massive even if the story and map isn't.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I think what we should push for is public financial statements more than a roadmap.  Singularity 6 isn't publicly traded so public financial statements aren't required but I think it would do good for the community to see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said I was disappointed in the patch yesterday but I personally realize it's only been 2 weeks since Closed Beta launch and not even a week since Open Beta started.  I'm personally going to give them some more time because they can't just shift what they were doing suddenly based on feedback.  Changes take time.  Coding/development takes time.\n",
