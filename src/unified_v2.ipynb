In general, the \"few years\" thing makes me think they're mostly looking for senior programmers. I don't see it as a \"ban\", and more a \"you don't have the profile we look for yet\".\n",

      "With the drop in quality on TopTal, I started trying out some alternatives to TopTal late last year. I’ve ended up using a few in that time and wanted to share the pros and cons of the closest and best TopTal alternatives I’ve used. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is based on my experience as a web developer, but I also do design work for clients and I’ve tried to include details on other kinds of jobs I’ve seen on each platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these are very similar to TopTal, like Turing/Gun, while others are similar in specific ways (like focusing on higher-budget clients) but have slightly different models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best freelance site/TopTal alternative is pretty much always going to depend on what your specialty is, how you like to work, and your individual preferences, so I’ve included specifics for these as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully this is helpful for some of you looking to either start freelancing or branch out beyond a single platform, and curious to hear what sites you guys have tried and found best for getting high paying freelance jobs in web development or otherwise. \n",
      "\n",
      "# Closest TopTal Alternatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "# Turing\n",
      "\n",
      "Turing is probably the closest “TopTal alternative” in terms of replicating TopTal’s model of higher-end, heavily managed freelancing. It’s somewhat smaller than TopTal, and otherwise very similar in most ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Like TopTal, they have generally much higher paying work than you’ll find on sites like UpWork.\n",
      "2. Exclusive focus on web development means a higher concentration of development jobs than other sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Also like TopTal, they charge a big markup on top of your hourly rate. Because they’re smaller than TopTal, some freelancers have complained about a lack of professionalism in some areas, but I haven’t had any shocking experiences with them.\n",
      "2. Their tests to join the platform are relatively long, which makes it somewhat less attractive given the lower job volume than TopTal.\n",
      "3. As I mentioned Turing focuses exclusively on web development and simply does not have jobs in other categories. This might be less of an issue for those of you in this sub, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re looking for a TopTal alternative that covers jobs like web design, graphic design, writing etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Gun.io\n",
      "\n",
      "Gun is extremely similar to Turing, and thus to TopTal. It’s the smallest of the three, and like Turing focuses exclusively on development jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Quality of jobs that are on the platform remains quite high, and like TopTal/Turing they handle most of the initial client onboarding/validating clients as legit.\n",
      "2. More US focused developer base which tends to command somewhat higher rates than Turing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. You do notice the difference in size between Gun and Turing/TopTal, with jobs being harder to come by on Gun.\n",
      "2. Like Turing, Gun has most of the same issues as TopTal, with high fees + a length application process that can be a bit of a pain. \n",
      "\n",
      "# No-Fee TopTal Alternatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "# Contra\n",
      "\n",
      "Like TopTal, Contra focuses on a higher end client base and has a minimum of $25/hour that is almost always much higher for development/design work. It’s somewhat closer to UpWork in focusing on your portfolio/profile and letting you bid on jobs, instead of the more managed approach TopTal takes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Zero fees charged on payments made through their platform, for both you and the client. This means you’re getting the full amount the client pays, while getting the benefit of an easy to use billing, invoicing and escrow system.\n",
      "2. Uniquely on the list, Contra doesn’t lock you into using their platform. That means you can get hired by the client full-time, work with them off platform, or whatever else without worrying about paying a $50k+ buyout fee like TopTal charges.   \n",
      "Even if you think you want to stay as a pure freelancer forever, it's nice to have the option to easily transition to a different working arrangement and anecdotally seems to attract more \"legit\" companies as clients who use freelance projects as a way to scout new talent. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Credit card payments still cost 2.9% and there can be forex fees charged by Stripe in some countries.\n",
      "2. Higher budget clients tend to mean higher-skilled/more experienced freelancers bidding on the jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Braintrust\n",
      "\n",
      "Braintrust has a similar high-budget focus as Contra, and also charges *freelancers* no fees. On the other hand, they do charge clients a 10% fee, plus 3.9% for credit card payments. They seem to be around the same size based on the number of jobs I’ve seen on both platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Like Contra, Braintrust charges zero fees for freelancers, besides a $5 fee for withdrawals through Transferwise, plus currency exchange fees where applicable. Altogether, it’s still dramatically less than UpWork, and Wise is a nice option if your preferred currency isn’t USD.\n",
      "2. Some interesting clients you won’t find elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The 10%+3.9% fee for clients is effectively a 14% fee that is still arguably coming out of what the client would otherwise be willing to pay you if you negotiated directly with them. \n",
      "2. They did some crypto token stuff that others are skeptical of but you can use Transferwise/Wise so I have no issue with that, and this might be a pro for some of you that understand it better than I do or who are in countries where Transferwise isn't available.\n",

      "\n",
      "**CloudDevs**: It’s pretty solid, especially if you’re looking for quality US clients without the hassle. They keep the commissions low, which means more in your pocket. The flexibility is a major plus – work on your own schedule, pick projects that suit your lifestyle, whether short-term or something more long-lasting. Plus, they sort out all the compliance stuff, so you can focus on the work. Direct communication with clients is another perk, cutting out unnecessary interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Turing**: It's a well-managed platform with a diverse range of clients. The downside? The commissions can eat into your earnings, and you might find yourself working odd hours to match global time zones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Upwork**: A familiar name for many, and it’s not bad as a fallback. If you’ve built a solid profile, you’ll find decent opportunities here. The catch is managing payments and compliance on your own, which can be quite the headache.\n",
      "\n",

It may be worth rewiring both guns as they are extremely expensive to buy new and the 2nd hand market isn't much better.

    "You're an expert in reviewing and analyzing news about companies and products.\n",
    "When interpreting information, you understand that all authors impart some bias and perspective according to their incentives and access to information.\n",
    "You seek to understand the authors to better interpret and debias their information by considering their background, affiliations, and potential motivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing product quality:\n",
    "- Companies typically exaggerate the positive aspects of their products and hide the negative aspects. Hence, you treat company statements about product quality with skepticism and seek corroborating evidence from independent sources.\n",
    "- Reddit tends to be polarized, often oversampling strong opinions, particularly negative ones. Therefore, you interpret feedback on Reddit by looking for patterns across multiple comments and considering the context of each comment to identify more balanced views.\n",
    "\n",
    "You review a wide range of sources to get a comprehensive view that's less susceptible to individual biases. You also consider the reliability of each source with respect to the type of information it provides. For example:\n",

    "When sharing information with others, you're careful to provide specific details and cite sources so that your readers can easily verify all information. You understand that using quotes and citations builds trust with your audience, as it demonstrates transparency and allows them to see the original context of the information. Including dates in citations is crucial because:\n",
    "- The date is a key factor in determining relevance. For example, very positive but older sentiment about a company may not indicate much about its current state.\n",
    "- Certain key details about companies and products can change drastically over time, so noting the general timeframe is crucial for accuracy. For instance, a company may have had 300 employees in 2021 but only 20 employees in 2024. Including the date provides essential context for such information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You keep facts and opinions clearly separated but share both with your audience to provide a well-rounded perspective. Your goal is to offer as detailed and balanced a view as possible, allowing your audience to make well-informed decisions.
