Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource! Especially for my two most common ailments, pink eye (I work with kids, they’re gross) and strep. Thanks for sharing\\n\\n### Comment ID eljexpb by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to elj1h0o):\\nYeah, it\\'s not a \"this solves all your problems\" thing, but it might be a \"this solves some of your problems this week\" thing.\\n\\nI love children and are they are horrible little germ spreaders.  Wonderful munchkins, terrible pink eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID eljwrv8 by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nSounds like a great service but what i don\\'t understand is, If they cannot prescribe you the medication due to ie; controlled substance etc. Why is she giving you price to purchase it under GoodRX?\\n\\nSorry that part wasn\\'t clear to me, I thought you needed a doctor approval to prescribe controlled substances.\\n\\n### Comment ID eljx9uw by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljwrv8):\\nSo there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!!

All three times they did not prescribe the needed antibiotic to get better. I had an ear infection, my husband had an ear infection, then I had a sinus infection. We had to wait and get into our family doctor, so we paid 98.6 and our family doctor. I would not recommend them!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID elkkysu by NightSkyButterfly on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nI\\'m not sure where your old prescription on file is, but I know at the big box pharmacy I used to work at we could send an electronic request to the doctor to write a new script without a visit. Doesn\\'t always work, but worth a try for a med you need!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID idl52u3 by Sweetcynic36 on 2022-06-24 [+1 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nHelped me get paxlovid for covid more quickly than I otherwise would have been able to.

I had a 98point6 text appointment the other day because it was late and I was frustrated at the scale again lol. For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages. My employer pays for my subscription but I think it's 10$/year for the first year or something. You can talk to a Dr for almost any condition 24/7!\\n\\nAnyway...I spoke to a Dr and was able to get lab orders done for everything I wanted. (I used my insurance to cover the cost of the various labs) I just had a quick follow-up visit (at my desk at work) to get my results five days later. I finally asked to try metformin extended release (my gyno never gave me) and they sent in the prescription!\\n\\nOverall it was an awesome experience and I got to avoid long waits and my copay.\\n\\n## Comment ID g4lctwr by hellokittyunicorn on 2020-09-09 [+1 votes] (in reply to ipmklh):\\nThat’s so fantastic.

I don’t have to rent cars often but the process is so stinking simple with Costco. It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver. This was one of the only things about one of my recent trips that went exactly as planned with no complications along the way.\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5h743x by didyouseemynipple on 2022-04-20 [+10 votes] (in reply to i5g414h):\\nThanks for this - I never rent elsewhere again\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5hkuv8 by nicoco2211 on 2022-04-20 [+2 votes] (in reply to i5g414h):\\nInteresting that you’re finding it to be cheaper.

A week or so before my trip I will check price again to see if they have dropped. If so I cancel and make a new reservation. I saved around $250 on my last weekly rental doing this.

The value of the service provided by FIGO is in line with the other services that we provide.\\n\\nMain points:\\n- You can use any veterinarian\\n- Coverage can range from UTI\\'s to Cancer\\n- You can customize plans to cater to your needs\\n- Insurance quotes differ for breeds, age and by zip code just like vehicle\\n- Like vehicle, you get additional 5% discount for\\nmultiple animals\\n- As a Gold Star member you get access to 15% off normal prices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment ID i5g0w5t by magicalgirlvalkyrie on 2022-04-20 [+12 votes] (in reply to i5fslmd):\\nHow is the pet insurance.

Right now I’m using my work’s insurance and it’s completely useless. Doesn’t cover dental cleanings, check ups, or vaccinations\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5hja6u by AromaticStrike9 on 2022-04-20 [+12 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nPet health insurance generally works more like traditional insurance (e.g. vehicle) that covers unexpected or infrequent incidents (e.g. car accident) rather than routine procedures (e.g. oil changes). Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it\\'s worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5ih6rv by screenwriter61 on 2022-04-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nI don\\'t know ANY that cover full dentals as they are so expensive.

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

      "Does that make sense?\n",

      "EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n",

For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages. My employer pays for my subscription but I think it's 10$/year for the first year or something. You can talk to a Dr for almost any condition 24/7!\n",

I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.

It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).

I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

      "EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.

The pharmacy didn't have the specific dose for my size dog in stock so they did have to oder it in. That took a few extra days. I think it was a Thursday or Friday and picked it up at Costco on a Wednesday. Hope it works out for you as well.\n",

      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",

      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages. My employer pays for my subscription but I think it's 10$/year for the first year or something. You can talk to a Dr for almost any condition 24/7!\n",

I finally asked to try metformin extended release (my gyno never gave me) and they sent in the prescription!\n",

      "# Post ID bg7ip2:  Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-22 [+54 votes]\n",
      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n",

      "Pet health insurance generally works more like traditional insurance (e.g. vehicle) that covers unexpected or infrequent incidents (e.g. car accident) rather than routine procedures (e.g. oil changes). Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it's worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\n",

Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Wonderful munchkins, terrible pink eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID eljwrv8 by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nSounds like a great service but what i don\\'t understand is, If they cannot prescribe you the medication due to ie; controlled substance etc. Why is she giving you price to purchase it under GoodRX?\\n\\nSorry that part wasn\\'t clear to me, I thought you needed a doctor approval to prescribe controlled substances.\\n\\n### Comment ID eljx9uw by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljwrv8):\\nSo there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!!

Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it\\'s worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5ih6rv by screenwriter61 on 2022-04-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nI don\\'t know ANY that cover full dentals as they are so expensive.

Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!!

Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it\\'s worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5ih6rv by screenwriter61 on 2022-04-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nI don\\'t know ANY that cover full dentals as they are so expensive.
