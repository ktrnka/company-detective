Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource! Especially for my two most common ailments, pink eye (I work with kids, they’re gross) and strep. Thanks for sharing\\n\\n### Comment ID eljexpb by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to elj1h0o):\\nYeah, it\\'s not a \"this solves all your problems\" thing, but it might be a \"this solves some of your problems this week\" thing.\\n\\nI love children and are they are horrible little germ spreaders.  Wonderful munchkins, terrible pink eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID eljwrv8 by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nSounds like a great service but what i don\\'t understand is, If they cannot prescribe you the medication due to ie; controlled substance etc. Why is she giving you price to purchase it under GoodRX?\\n\\nSorry that part wasn\\'t clear to me, I thought you needed a doctor approval to prescribe controlled substances.\\n\\n### Comment ID eljx9uw by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljwrv8):\\nSo there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!! I will have to keep that service in mind, Thanks for clarifying.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID jl3md0l by booalijules on 2023-05-22 [+1 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nWhat about something like dexamethasone or prednisone?\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID hrmpl3t by MarketWorldly9908 on 2022-01-07 [+3 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nMy husband and I have used 98.6 three times. All three times they did not prescribe the needed antibiotic to get better. I had an ear infection, my husband had an ear infection, then I had a sinus infection. We had to wait and get into our family doctor, so we paid 98.6 and our family doctor. I would not recommend them!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID elkkysu by NightSkyButterfly on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nI\\'m not sure where your old prescription on file is, but I know at the big box pharmacy I used to work at we could send an electronic request to the doctor to write a new script without a visit. Doesn\\'t always work, but worth a try for a med you need!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID idl52u3 by Sweetcynic36 on 2022-06-24 [+1 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nHelped me get paxlovid for covid more quickly than I otherwise would have been able to.

I had a 98point6 text appointment the other day because it was late and I was frustrated at the scale again lol. For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages. My employer pays for my subscription but I think it's 10$/year for the first year or something. You can talk to a Dr for almost any condition 24/7!\\n\\nAnyway...I spoke to a Dr and was able to get lab orders done for everything I wanted. (I used my insurance to cover the cost of the various labs) I just had a quick follow-up visit (at my desk at work) to get my results five days later. I finally asked to try metformin extended release (my gyno never gave me) and they sent in the prescription!\\n\\nOverall it was an awesome experience and I got to avoid long waits and my copay.\\n\\n## Comment ID g4lctwr by hellokittyunicorn on 2020-09-09 [+1 votes] (in reply to ipmklh):\\nThat’s so fantastic.

I don’t have to rent cars often but the process is so stinking simple with Costco. It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver.

Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it\\'s worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5ih6rv by screenwriter61 on 2022-04-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nI don\\'t know ANY that cover full dentals as they are so expensive.

There’s nothing stopping them from selling it at Costco prices.\\n\\nAnd before you yell “small business”, those gas stations are big name brands like Chevron.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5gljpf by nearfignewton on 2022-04-20 [+6 votes] (in reply to i5fyhgr):\\nI’m an early riser so I pull up about 5 minutes before they open on sat/sun.

I might try to transfer my prescription elsewhere but the only other pharmacy anywhere near me is a CVS and from what I\\'ve seen, they also don\\'t fill many telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. \\n\\nAnd yeah, I understand caution with controlled substances, but it\\'s really weird to me that if any other certified provider had prescribed this, it would have been fine, but because it was a certified provider online it\\'s not ok??? It\\'s just frustrating.\\n\\n#### Comment ID isvmbc3 by milliarius on 2022-10-19 [+86 votes] (in reply to isu7f5c):\\nquick comment, you would need a whole new rx sent to whichever pharmacy may be willing to fill it for you. can’t transfer CII rxs\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID isum0f8 by None on 2022-10-18 [+184 votes] (in reply to isu7f5c):\\nfwiw I’ve had no issues with getting my telehealth prescription filled at CVS.

Words can’t describe how much I hate that stupid company. I’d recommend calling your primary care provider and explaining the situation. Most of the time they can write it as long as you can show a diagnosis and proof you’ve taken it before. \\n\\nThat’ll also protect you from losing your prescription when the pandemic exemption eventually expires— it’s a general rule for controlled substances that you need at least one in-person meeting with the doctor before they can fill it. I think some places don’t require this, but AFAIK it was a requirement pre-2020. I know they did also always require the person who prescribed it to be in-state back then as well. \\n\\nAt least they stopped requiring you to physically deliver HANDWRITTEN prescriptions. That was the stupidest thing. You’d normally get 3 at a time, and if you lost one for the month? Sucks to suck. Can’t think of a less adhd-friendly system. I think that changed 2018-ish?

Luckily, I get my prescriptions just fine at my local Walgreens (but had to switch to an independent pharmacy just because of shortages at the wholesaler), but the whole reason I was able to get diagnosed and prescribed medication was because of how accessible telehealth services are. Finding a prescriber/doctor and therapist on my own and going in person were more than my depressed, anxious brain struggling with executive functioning can handle, and I\\'m sure it\\'s the same for many people.\\n\\nProviders write Rxs.

I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I\\'ve seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\\n\\nAdderall works great for a lot of people, there are plenty of people that depend on it. It is also a dangerous stimulant that is wickedly over-prescribed. I can understand the pharmacy having hesitations about this. In the not-so-distant past, it was opioids being handed out like candy. We are approaching a similar situation with psychostimulants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID isw0m6l by Random_182f2565 on 2022-10-19 [+1 votes] (in reply to isu7f5c):\\nIsn\\'t that just bad faith tho?\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID isx707b by NegotiationTx on 2022-10-19 [+1 votes] (in reply to isu7f5c):\\nThey can ef off with that policy.

It sucks miserably all the same. \\n\\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see regulations get even tighter about how prescriptions have to be formatted to be accepted, especially to prove that the practitioner is legitimately licensed to prescribe in the state. My state requires a physical paper prescription be presented every time, no refills, no digital, no call-ins. My psych writes them 3 months at a time and post-dates them with “do not fill before m/d/yy” on each one. Took me a year to learn that the pharmacy I use for my Cotempla will take them all at once if they’re post-dated. I didn’t know that was allowed. \\n\\nThe system is so damn ableist, I’m waiting for them to say the doctor has to practice inside a hospital and the script can only be filled there for verification.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment ID iswdn14 by CountBacula322079 on 2022-10-19 [+1 votes] (in reply to isusvie):\\nI have also had good experience with Costco\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID isvm5em by brokerceej on 2022-10-19 [+34 votes] (in reply to y7elk6):\\nYeah for 20 years I’ve been putting up with this shit at Walgreens and CVS.

Snorting my adderall up in 3 days then going without for 27. Sure. \\n\\nSome people like me have been on these drugs for decades and the stigma attached to stimulants hasn’t really improved. I even switched to vyvanse for years because I figured I’d be hassled less about a drug you can’t really abuse. Nope. Same shit. \\n\\nMom and pop pharmacy was a blessing. They pre order my meds so they are in stock when I need them and I’ve never been hassled. They even fill them 2-3 days early when Walgreens assured me they didn’t care if I was traveling for a week tomorrow and had one pill left, filling it a day early was *illegal*.

Basically pill mills started up, and doctors at them would write scripts for millions of pills for \"patients\" all over the country that they could never have possibly seen. So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you\\'ve not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI get telehealth can be a good thing, but for psychoactive medication that can be abused like stimulants, I think what Walgreens and CVS are doing is a reasonable control mechanism on  MDs/DOs/PAs/APNs just writing scripts like crazy.\\n\\n#### Comment ID isvvl0w by Tragically_Fantastic on 2022-10-19 [+7 votes] (in reply to isve0mi):\\nI do think it\\'s an ok policy, but basically what this pharmacist said was if they can get in touch with my prescriber, they\\'ll fill it one time, but after that they won\\'t do it again, which feels kinda backwards to me? I feel like it should be the other way around, if they get in touch with the prescriber then they can fill my prescription because they know it\\'s legit, but the way they\\'re doing it is like \"Alright, you can abuse these drugs one time, but no more after that\".

I couldn’t get myself to just find a therapist or a way to get help that I could tell I desperately needed. I got prescribed a non-stimulant from the telehealth provider and it was a pain in the ass to get answers to my concerns about the medication side effects.

Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that\\'s why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first.

I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \\n\\nI can also understand that seeing a doctor in person is difficult for some people and their schedules- I have to schedule an appt once every 3 months in person myself and it is very difficult with my unpredictable schedule. Bottom line is our license and livelihood is on the line. I think of telehealth as a non-permanent solution while establishing a provider in your community.\\n\\nLastly, with so many rx now coming from telehealth we are hitting our max of many stimulants that we can order from the DEA on a monthly basis. I cannot take care of our current clientele with the massive influx - we already hit our DEA limit as it is. I usually suggest folks try another pharmacy in a more suburban area (we are urban and Adderall-sense) so you don’t have to go weeks without your medication. \\n\\nAlso as some others have mentioned, C2s cannot be transferred so you will need to have your prescriber send in a new rx to the pharmacy at which you want to have it filled. \\n\\nWe’re also extremely understaffed which complicates everything. Please be nice to us. It is hell on earth at most pharmacies right now. \\n\\n**I would suggest doing mail order pharmacy to get your med (Amazon has a pharmacy) or any independent pharmacy in your area.** I hope this helps clarify some misunderstandings.\\n\\n### Comment ID isyt1l9 by Tragically_Fantastic on 2022-10-19 [+2 votes] (in reply to isyqlmt):\\nYeah, I understand that.

It used to be sooo easy with my psychiatrist. Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \\n\\nBut she retired... now i go to my practioner because I\\'m fucking stable! (Honestly super proud of that accomplishment) however, this new doctor can\\'t prescribe them for 90 days only 30. So every month I have to remember to call their office. Explain to the person on the phone what I need. That yes I have two meds with the same name. I\\'ve been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn\\'t call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill. And now its time to  start the whole refill process over again. And GOD FORBID MY MED COUNTS ARE OUT OF SYNC\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID it6nzlf by None on 2022-10-21 [+1 votes] (in reply to y7elk6):\\nThe telehealth stuff was during the pandemic.  I\\'m gonna miss it so much.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID j19m78e by Crybabysmom on 2022-12-22 [+1 votes] (in reply to y7elk6):\\nLMAO story of my life. I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn\\'t have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was so down in the dumps. Then I was taught a new method of thinking by a person I look up to. I started ending all the negative shit. I started saying positive stuff to myself to build myself up... \"You are a pre-med student and will get any treatment you need for any illness you are diagnosed with.\" I looked on reddit for pharmacies that other students of UCF were using and not having trouble getting their rX\\'S filled.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI basically changed up my thinking and if I got a negative response from a pharmacy (I did, a few times...) I simply acted confused (Because deep down I was anyways)... If someone treats you in a way you know for a fact you do not deserve, do not get upset back at them, do not get upset period... It is okay to show confusion, which is justified. Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am a good person. I do however have ADHD. I deserve treatment. I deserve to be treated with respect. Trust me, okay, there is a way to get your RX filled. It may not be through Walgreens, but there is a way if you keep up your spirits and be true to what you deserve. Do not use this as an excuse to get frustrated and head back to the streets for illegal adderall. Fight for your own prescription!!!!  \\n\\n\\nI ended up getting mine filled at a Costco, a pharamcy which has been deemed to be problematic for telehealth prescriptions. However I did not have one single problem with them and they treated me like a decent human being. Yes its 1 hour from my house, but I will gladly pass all the pharmacies that literally are 100% fine with prescribing 1,000,000s of lethal Oxycontin pills but not 1 helpful stimulant or OUD MAT therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID j6dvo6h by PenaltyParticular909 on 2023-01-29 [+1 votes] (in reply to y7elk6):\\nThat\\'s why I stopped going to Big box pharmacies because they\\'re always looking at you sideways like they don\\'t drink their bottles of wine as soon as they get home.

Even when I got my supplement prescription, I take a 10 mg extended release once per day and also I\\'m prescribed a 10 mg instant release once per day, when they added that instant release they were really cool about it too, they even helped reach out to my insurance company to get it covered.\\n\\n',\n",

SOme people can\\'t digest enough of it even if they eat plenty of food sources with it, and all the more likely if you have bad gut health.  Folate, copper or protein are also needed for production of white blood cells.  In general, copper, iron, vitamin A, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 are specifically associated with the production of blood cells.  b1 is needed for red blood cells.  And there may be others, not sure if I got them all.  \\n\\nAlso over exercising or endurance sports are known to lessen the body\\'s supply of wbc, the body is really not designed for chronic intense exercise over long periods.   If you exercise a lot and are low in some of these vitamins, that can make it worse, exercise depletes a lot of vitamins like b1. \\n\\nI would make sure all these issues are settled before looking at any more potentially serious issues.  If you have poor gut function or are trying with b12 which many can\\'t digest, you can use sublingual vitamins to bypass the gut.  Some people even have to get occasional b12 injections (which you can do at home).\\n\\n### Comment ID hpjx4kz by devilsadvocado on 2021-12-22 [+1 votes] (in reply to hphi5a6):\\nThis is exactly the kind of information I was hoping to receive from my post.

You\\'d need to do the test for transketolase activity to get an accurate read which I think may not even be available in your area.

Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don\\'t know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\\n\\nBut ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don\\'t get the pay if you don\\'t work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn\\'t want to call out I really didn\\'t want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\\n\\nWe have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\\n\\nI haven\\'t got a test because I can\\'t find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\\n\\nI seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn\\'t as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won\\'t be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\\n\\nBut like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don\\'t even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn\\'t give an hours notice. When I can\\'t because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated. If anyone has the unum number that redirects to the afterhours thing or the teledoc I would appreciate it.

Hope it’s useful. by annetteisshort on 2020-01-08 [+3288 votes]\\nYou guys left so many awesome resources throughout the comments of the last post, so I thought I’d consolidate the info into an easier to read list for whoever might need it. I went ahead and looked up each service to verify they are legit, and listed the basic details of each one. \\n\\nAs always, shop around. Depending on what you need, some services may be cheaper than others.\\n\\n\\n**—** Digital Doctor Services **—**\\n\\n**K Health**\\n\\n*        $14 for one appointment with 2 weeks open for questions and follow-up.\\n*        $39 per year for unlimited appointments. \\n*        Subscription not required for the $14 appointments. \\n*        You can get labs and prescriptions.\\n*        Can use with or without insurance.\\n*        Monthly subscription service for anxiety/depression with benefits of normal yearly subscription + mental health specific consultations, treatment plans, referrals, and monthly medication delivery. Must consult app to sign up and get approved for this particular service.\\n\\n\\n**HeyDoctor**\\n       \\n*        $20 for most appointments, though costs can vary depending on what you need an appointment for. Most typical appointments are $20, but check the website for all prices.\\n*        You can get labs and prescriptions \\n*        Can use with or without insurance.\\n \\n\\n*The prices of the next two digital doctor services are extremely comparable to typical cash prices for seeing a regular doctor. Not all that budget friendly in my opinion, but I’ll list them and their prices since they were in the comment section of the previous post.*\\n\\n\\n**Teladoc**  \\n\\n*        $49 or less for typical doctor consultations.\\n*        $75 or less for Dermatology consultations\\n*        $80 per visit for licensed Therapist.\\n*        $95-$200 per visit with licensed Psychiatrist.\\n*        Can provide prescriptions.\\n\\n\\n**Doctor on Demand**\\n\\n*        $75 for 15 minute consultation with doctor.\\n*        $129-$179 for 25-50 minute consultation with psychologist. \\n*        $299 for 45 minute consultation with Psychiatrist.\\n*        $129 for 15 minute follow-up with psychiatrist.\\n*        Consultations can be extended for additional fees.\\n*        Prices above are cash prices, but this service also accepts insurance.\\n*        Can provide prescriptions.\\n\\n\\n*In addition to the services listed above, you should also consult your insurance, if you have any, to see what telehealth services they might offer.

It’s worth a try to look it up and what might be available where you live.\\n\\n**Cash Discounts**\\n\\n*        Some doctors accept a discounted cash payment for treatment, so shop around where you live to see what options might be available to you.\\n\\n**Local Health Districts**\\n\\n*        You can get low cost or free vaccinations at local health districts. \\n*        Also ask them about other preventative vaccines, like HPV and Flu Shots. It doesn’t hurt to check if your town/city offers free or discounted preventative vaccines.\\n\\n\\n**—** Medication Discounts **—**\\n\\n**GoodRX**\\n\\n*        Medication discount up to 80%.\\n*        Lists the after-discount cost of all local pharmacies, as some are cheaper than others.\\n*        Use discount coupons when you pick up your prescriptions from your pharmacy.\\n*        Will call your pharmacy for you if they initially refuse to accept it, or don’t understand what it is.\\n*        Free service. No subscription needed.\\n\\n**Blink Health**\\n\\n*        Buy online and pick up medications at your pharmacy, or have them delivered.\\n*        Free delivery.\\n*        Can get consult with doctor if you don’t currently have a prescription.\\n*        Free service, no subscription needed.\\n*        See their website for a list of participating pharmacies.\\n*        Can request refills, transfer prescriptions, and consult a licensed pharmacist with any questions.\\n\\n**Manufacturer’s Website**\\n\\n*        Every medication manufacturer may offer huge discounts on their medications on their own websites.\\n\\n**Grocery store discount programs**\\n\\n*        Your local grocery stores, including Walmart, likely have prescription discount plans, so make sure to ask your pharmacy about theirs!\\n*        Typically it’s a yearly fee to sign up for these services. For instance, at Kroger it is $36/year. \\n\\n**Honeybee Health**\\n\\n*        Online discount pharmacy.\\n*        No insurance accepted.\\n*        Free Delivery.\\n*        Offers medications at wholesale prices.\\n\\n**Pharmacychecker**\\n\\n*        Price comparison service for online pharmacies.\\n*        Free to use.\\n*        Does not provide medications, just helps you compare prices.\\n\\n**The Pill Club**\\n\\n*        Birth Control Only.\\n*        $0 medication with most insurance.\\n*        $15 consultation fee + cost of medication with no insurance, or if out of market insurance.\\n*        Free medication delivery with a few feminine goodies.\\n\\n**Nurx**\\n\\n*        Sexual Health only.\\n*        $15 consultation fees for each various service.

Consult their FAQ page for detailed test prices.\\n*        Medications can be billed to insurance.\\n*        Provides sexual health medications, including birth control and Plan B.\\n*        Provides home testing kits for sexual-related illness such as STI testing and HPV screening.\\n*        Can also order lab testing if preferred over home testing.\\n\\n**Simple Health**\\n\\n*        Birth Control Only.\\n*        $0 prescription with most insurance.\\n*        $20 annual fee for the care package, includes initial consultation with doctor.\\n*        As low as $15 per month prescription cost with no insurance.\\n*        Free shipping.\\n*        Automatic Refills.\\n\\n\\n**—** Prescription Skin Care **—**\\n\\n**Curology**\\n\\n*        $19.95 per month, plus shipping.\\n*        Includes ability to talk to provider\\n*        Includes customized skin care formula.\\n*        Includes cleanser and moisturizer.\\n*        Includes 2 minute skincare routine to follow with the above products.\\n\\n\\nWith any prescription that is more than you’re able to afford, you should also ask your pharmacist about alternative options, as they likely know something cheaper, or they can point out an over-the-counter medication or supplement that can help in the meantime if you can’t afford a doctor. I’ve personally had my pharmacist show me what over the counter medications would help with anxiety medication withdrawal that happens with certain anxiety and depression medications when you stop taking it. They helped me pick a vitamin that would help keep the anxiety at bay a bit so I didn’t have a complete breakdown while waiting for more meds. Pharmacists are a fantastic resource, and they’re happy to help.\\n\\nAlso, try applying for free healthcare. It is available for people in hardship, and there is no shame in getting help from the government when you need it. It doesn’t hurt to just see if you qualify. I’ve used it before, and it can help relieve a little of the stress from poverty to at least know you’re covered if something happens. \\n\\nThanks everyone for all your input on the previous post. If you know of other free and low-cost medical services, please comment below and tell us about them!\\n\\nEdit: formatting\\n\\nEdit2: Another user has had success using GoodRX at Publix.

I\\'ve been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I\\'ve called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need. I\\'ve been battling with worsening anxiety and symptoms of adult ADHD, and have felt nothing short of hopeless about it. But now I\\'ve just signed up for K Health and am currently waiting to speak to a doctor now, all at an *affordable* price.\\n\\nOP, you\\'re a rockstar. Thank you *thank you.* And thank you to everyone who contributed to this amazing list!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit/update: after filling in my info, waited \\\\~25 mins for a doctor to speak to me.

I can reach out any time for help or with questions, and he will follow up in a couple weeks. I\\'m in awe how easy this was, and the relief of not having to worry how I\\'ll afford this is overwhelming. Give this a try if needed, folks! Good luck to you all!\\n\\nEdit 2: Sorry, I should clarify I’m being sent anti-anxiety medication, not something for ADHD.

I think we’re conditioned at this point to not trust anything like this, because it just seems too good to be true, and life is rarely that easy for people in our shoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment ID fdlq3k7 by Hobo-and-the-hound on 2020-01-09 [+11 votes] (in reply to fdkhzuk):\\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what medication?

You pay a one time $59 fee to join, and then they subsidize the costs of your therapy appointments (if you see one of the providers listed on the website). Therapy appointments are $30-60 a session depending on the provider and your financial need. This is 1/3-1/2 of what you\\'d pay a therapist out of pocket without mental health insurance.\\n\\nThis is specifically for therapy, not psychiatry. A regular doctor can write a RX for psychiatric meds, you don\\'t have to see an expensive psychiatrist for this.  So if you\\'re wanting medication and therapy, go to a regular doctor for the meds, and use a low-cost therapy resource.\\n\\nIf you are on Medicaid or Medicare, community mental health agencies will give you free mental health therapy and usually free psychiatric medication also.\\n\\n### Comment ID fdkr0iy by annetteisshort on 2020-01-08 [+12 votes] (in reply to fdkqrut):\\nThis is fantastic info.

I used to manage the private practice for a psychiatrist. I dealt with insurance every day for 3 years. Still have a hard time navigating healthcare related stuff. And I didn’t know many of these resources. \\n\\nAlso, can confirm that going through the manufactures website is super helpful. You can find specific coupons and resources not available on GoodRx or through your pharmacy. I take Vyvanse for ADHD, which does not have a generic yet. With a coupon (without insurance) it costs almost $300 for a month supply. I found a program called Shire Cares (through the manufacture) that gives you a coupon to get Vyvanse (and some of their other meds) at no cost if you make less than around $80,000. It took around 3 months for it all to go through (they make it difficult for a reason), but I did end up getting it! As a grad student, this was a lifesaver.

When the recession hit the drug companies realized they’d go out of business if they didn’t provide copay assistance.

Also, I’ve updated one of my responses on the other post but Publix DOES accept GoodRX. If a pharmacy location rejects your discount card or coupon, it’s because the pharmacy manager or district manager is forcing everyone’s hand into not mentioning other discount programs or accepting said discounts, which is NOT okay. If this happens to you, immediately transfer your prescription(s) to a different pharmacy. If this is a regular occurrence at multiple pharmacies in a certain area, go to a different chain or if another city is close enough try one there. I’ve had this happen many times to me when I worked in that field and I feel like it’s totally unfair.\\n\\nAnother thing to note would be that if they reject your discount one time, it may not be the same another time. If they tell you their price for a prescription is cheaper than your GoodRX price, this is for a SCRIPT BY SCRIPT BASIS. If they tell you this and their price is cheaper it does NOT mean you can’t use GoodRX there for your other scripts that are cheaper via GoodRx or another site.\\n\\nAlso, a coupon is different from a discount/savings program. A coupon is something you can ONLY get from a manufacturer website (not all discounts from these sites are coupons though) or through your provider if said manufacturer has given them coupons, or sometimes through other programs. It is MANDATORY that these are accepted. An example of a coupon vs savings/discount would be that a coupon would state you can get x quantity for free, but a discount would just lower the cost. Coupons almost always make your prescription cheaper than savings/discount sites and must always be accepted.\\n\\n### Comment ID fdlzkv3 by annetteisshort on 2020-01-09 [+2 votes] (in reply to fdkmumt):\\nYou’re fantastic!\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID fdkojpe by ThePersnicketyBitch on 2020-01-08 [+9 votes] (in reply to elryxp):\\nJust a suggested edit - Publix absolutely *does* take GoodRX!

Has anyone had experience getting the depo shot from any of the sites mentioned, I checked out the pill club but it doesn\\'t have depo shot as an option which makes sense, but I didn\\'t know if anyone else had any ideas?

I just had to go off of my anti-depressants because I couldn\\'t afford multiple doctor appointments, but can I get them re-prescribed through the app?\\n\\n### Comment ID fdluy11 by annetteisshort on 2020-01-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to fdldrq4):\\nYes, you should be able to. When you download the app, you make a profile and the AI, K, will help you out by asking a bunch of questions about your history and symptoms. You pay $14, and then she will connect you to a doctor. Takes 10-20 minutes to have a doctor connect to you.\\n\\nOnce the doctor joins chat, they confirm your symptoms, and ask any additional questions they need to know. If you’ve got an anti-depressant you already like that works well with you, let them know what that is, and how long you’ve been off of it. They’ll let you know what they want to prescribe. They should be able to send the prescription directly to your pharmacy, or you can get it from K Health and have it mailed to you. From other comments, it sounds like the cost of meds from the app was comparable to a pharmacy with a discount coupon. \\n\\nHope this helps. :)\\n\\n#### Comment ID fdmgc2h by hologram_girl on 2020-01-09 [+2 votes] (in reply to fdluy11):\\nOmg, this is amazing.

There are several more doctors apps now since this post was made, and recently https://costplusdrugs.com was created to prove that medications don’t have to be insanely expensive. Check there if you need medication without insurance to see if it has what you need, and compare with the GoodRX app prices. For tons of medications it’s way cheaper on the new online pharmacy, and for medications they don’t have, GoodRX is still the next best option.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID jkkp12v by Kimmioio82 on 2023-05-18 [+2 votes] (in reply to elryxp):\\nYou just blessed me and this literally helped me get through a really hard time because I found care that I otherwise would not have if I didn’t come across this.\\n\\n### Comment ID jkl44cg by annetteisshort on 2023-05-18 [+2 votes] (in reply to jkkp12v):\\nI’m glad it was able to help you.

I already have to pay for meds put of pocket. If anyone else is in that position there is an app called 98point6. It's a telemedicine app that's 20 dollars for the year then no further fees. I downloaded it because I was desperate and had a week's worth of my meds left. I talked to a doctor for about an hour and he gave me a refill for everything I needed plus a couple other scripts for other things going on with me. This app saved my sanity. I have a job starting this coming week and not having meds would have probably ruined everything. I can't recommend this enough if you can't see someone to get your refills refreshed.\\n\\n## Comment ID eleoyfu by Demilitarizer on 2019-04-21 [+5 votes] (in reply to bfj4ni):\\nDo they fax them to your pharmacy?

      "# Post ID bg7ip2:  Internet medicine is awesome, 98point6 was so so helpful for me by FrugalChef13 on 2019-04-22 [+57 votes]\n",
      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that make sense?\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n",

      "Pet health insurance generally works more like traditional insurance (e.g. vehicle) that covers unexpected or infrequent incidents (e.g. car accident) rather than routine procedures (e.g. oil changes). Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it's worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\n",

They will try to fill it for me once if they can get in touch with the person who prescribed in to me, but idk if that's actually going to happen.

There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids.

      "Try seeing your primary care provider. Let them know you were diagnosed by a therapist and it’s tough to get quick follow-up care or responses to your medication questions and you want to start getting your meds from them to have more localized access to your needs. I was diagnosed through a telehealth provider because executive disfunction wouldn’t let me get help the traditional way. I couldn’t get myself to just find a therapist or a way to get help that I could tell I desperately needed. I got prescribed a non-stimulant from the telehealth provider and it was a pain in the ass to get answers to my concerns about the medication side effects. So I went to my regular doctor and told them everything and they just switched me over to Adderall thankfully. I was really just wasting time and torturing myself with the non-stimulant and it’s side effects\n",

      "Honestly, I wish everyone with ADHD could get diagnosed and prescribed at Mayo... I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first. Side side note, for anyone who has had problems with Mayo, I'm sorry you went through that, and this is just my own personal experience.\n",

      "Pharmacist here. I promise we aren’t trying to make life miserable for you. I have adhd too. We have a duty to fill a prescription “in good faith” - I can lose my license otherwise. Example: There are 2 providers from telehealth that I see hundreds and hundreds of Adderall rx from - from their FL, CO, and CA office. I do not see them prescribe *anything* except Adderall. At all. That is a massive red flag for me. They have also (confirmed) never met with any of their patients in person. Another red flag. \n",

Dr. Awesome would prescribe my meds for 90 days. So I would call her once every 3 months and l would... get this... only have to leave her a message. All her phone calls went directly to voice mail. And if I left her with my name, meds refilled and phone number to reach me I would get a notification 1 hour later that she sent my script in. I would see her in person every six months as a general check up. So fucking easy. \n",

I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill.

      "LMAO story of my life. I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n",

Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year. Other pharmacies were following their lead. \n",

      "Being low in some vitamins can cause low wbc, for instance several of the b vitamins are required.   b12 is the most common one to be low on as it is a big molecule and harder to digest.  SOme people can't digest enough of it even if they eat plenty of food sources with it, and all the more likely if you have bad gut health.  Folate, copper or protein are also needed for production of white blood cells.  In general, copper, iron, vitamin A, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 are specifically associated with the production of blood cells.  b1 is needed for red blood cells.  And there may be others, not sure if I got them all.  \n",

If you have poor gut function or are trying with b12 which many can't digest, you can use sublingual vitamins to bypass the gut.

I don’t believe Amazon will continue the investigation if you’re no longer a employee.

      "# Post ID ru2atc:  Costco Employee trying to call out sick but can't because I open by ShiranaiJittai on 2022-01-02 [+0 votes]\n",
      "Thankfully we get the day off on Major Holidays. Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don't know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n",

      "I haven't got a test because I can't find a pharmacy nearby that stocked any my mom ordered one offline that said it would get there on friday (when she was ordering it for herself) then it said sunday and now it says TBD)\n",
      "\n",
      "I seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don't even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn't give an hours notice. When I can't because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\n",

I've been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I've called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need.

      "Not gonna lie, I legit thought I was going to be scammed when I used it too, but decided after a little research that it was worth the $14 risk. Even called my pharmacy to verify they got a prescription shortly after talking to the doctor. Just in case. Lol I still didn’t fully believe it, and felt mildly shady passing my phone to the pharmacy tech with the GoodRX info on it even though that pharmacy told me about it in the first place. I think we’re conditioned at this point to not trust anything like this, because it just seems too good to be true, and life is rarely that easy for people in our shoes.\n",

      "Yay I’m so glad you made this post! Also, I’ve updated one of my responses on the other post but Publix DOES accept GoodRX. If a pharmacy location rejects your discount card or coupon, it’s because the pharmacy manager or district manager is forcing everyone’s hand into not mentioning other discount programs or accepting said discounts, which is NOT okay. If this happens to you, immediately transfer your prescription(s) to a different pharmacy. If this is a regular occurrence at multiple pharmacies in a certain area, go to a different chain or if another city is close enough try one there. I’ve had this happen many times to me when I worked in that field and I feel like it’s totally unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to note would be that if they reject your discount one time, it may not be the same another time. If they tell you their price for a prescription is cheaper than your GoodRX price, this is for a SCRIPT BY SCRIPT BASIS. If they tell you this and their price is cheaper it does NOT mean you can’t use GoodRX there for your other scripts that are cheaper via GoodRx or another site.\n",

A coupon is something you can ONLY get from a manufacturer website (not all discounts from these sites are coupons though) or through your provider if said manufacturer has given them coupons, or sometimes through other programs. It is MANDATORY that these are accepted. An example of a coupon vs savings/discount would be that a coupon would state you can get x quantity for free, but a discount would just lower the cost. Coupons almost always make your prescription cheaper than savings/discount sites and must always be accepted.\n",

      "So this is my first year without health insurance as I got priced out of the market this year for some reason (possibly because I got married). So my question is, I found a doctor that will inject my depo shot for cheap but on this list it says that Publix doesn't honor the goodrx coupons for birth control, so should I use something else? Has anyone had experience getting the depo shot from any of the sites mentioned, I checked out the pill club but it doesn't have depo shot as an option which makes sense, but I didn't know if anyone else had any ideas? Also, has anyone had any experience with getting a yearly gynecology appointment without insurance? I don't have Planned Parenthood in my area sadly so I can't use them.\n",

If you're not very low income and don't have a healthcare card, they'll just say that's what it costs. But if you call a different imaging centre like Capital, they're usually bulk billing for anyone, not just healthcare card holders or pensioners. If that helps anyone.

      "Hey guys I was recently in the spot where I don't have insurance so I can't really afford to see a psychiatrist to get refills. I already have to pay for meds put of pocket. If anyone else is in that position there is an app called 98point6. It's a telemedicine app that's 20 dollars for the year then no further fees. I downloaded it because I was desperate and had a week's worth of my meds left. I talked to a doctor for about an hour and he gave me a refill for everything I needed plus a couple other scripts for other things going on with me. This app saved my sanity. I have a job starting this coming week and not having meds would have probably ruined everything. I can't recommend this enough if you can't see someone to get your refills refreshed.\n",

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",

      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",

      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages.

It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver.

      "Definitely. I don’t have to rent cars often but the process is so stinking simple with Costco. It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver. This was one of the only things about one of my recent trips that went exactly as planned with no complications along the way.\n",

      "The way the pharmacist explained it, it's basically that they don't fill telehealth prescriptions because they want the prescriber to be local and they can't guarantee that telehealth doctors are following proper guidelines. They will try to fill it for me once if they can get in touch with the person who prescribed in to me, but idk if that's actually going to happen. I might try to transfer my prescription elsewhere but the only other pharmacy anywhere near me is a CVS and from what I've seen, they also don't fill many telehealth prescriptions for controlled substances. \n",

      "The telehealth thing is getting entirely out of hand, they basically serve as a rubber stamp for scheduled prescription drugs. I love the simplicity and often lower cost of telehealth, but I honestly wonder if they ever decline to give out a prescription. If you want Adderall, you just pay the online provider and get a script. There are even telehealth services for testosterone replacement therapy prescribing 200mg of testosterone to 19 year old kids who basically want legal anabolic steroids. I've seen guys with testosterone levels of 800pg/dL getting TRT scripts for quadruple the normal dosage. While some providers may be acting responsibly, there are countless services that are not.\n",

So as a response Walgreens (and CVS, I believe), the two largest pharmacy chains in the US, have instituted a policy that if you are presenting a new script, the prescriber is not local, and you've not been on the medication before, the pharmacist can, and usually will require that they speak to the doctor to confirm the script, dosage, and DX before dispensing the drug. \n",

I have not had one ounce of ill will or trouble from anyone at Mayo, and I can just go to their pharmacy and get my Rx filled. The worst part is waiting between appointments... The journey from initial consult to CBT appointments and then confirmation with a psych eval and prescribing meds took about a year, not because they were unsure, but because the calendars were (and remain) pretty well booked up. Side note: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (recurrent), and that's why I had CBT appointments mixed in there. They had to rule out anxiety before ADHD, but the doc smartly suggested the ADHD was leading to my anxiety, so he is treating the ADHD first. Side side note, for anyone who has had problems with Mayo, I'm sorry you went through that, and this is just my own personal experience.\n",

I've been through this routine so many times I can pronounce dexemethlyfenidate. She passes it along to the doctor. Doctor approves it and after two days if the pharmacy doesn't call me I have to call them to make sure it got pushed through. Wait another day. Now it takes them a week or so to figure out billing me. By the time they do bill me I forget about it and it ends up getting close to being over due. I pay the bill.

      "LMAO story of my life. I wonder if its a blessing in disguise for some people. Guys if you are going through this, do not let it stress you. This is what I did, now be prepared because it is going to sound cheesy because I am a very cheesy person... When Walgreens made me wait 3 weeks for my newly prescribed telehealth Adderall 10mgs during the last few weeks of school (including finals), it made me feel like... worse than poop. I will admit when I got the RX, I had the most surreal sense of calm and peace. Like finally my war was over and I could be treated like a normal person. I didn't have to seek illegal alternatives anymore and feel like a criminal. I could finally get help for my issues and my life was about to improve dramatically. Then doubt crept in, I am not worth this RX, I am not worth getting better, I am a criminal, I am a bad person. I do not deserve to be high functioning like my friends and family. I deserve to live the life I am living. (Obviously have self-esteem issues) With all this thinking floating around in my head, I called Walgreens to see if they ahd received my medication, and this started the whole awkward \"Oh, the medication is on back-order and we do not know when it will be in.\" If a pharmacy wants to fill your RX, the alternative to this wil be \"Oh, your medication is not in stock but go ahead and get your RX sent in so we can get it in stock ASAP.\" There is no such thing as just telling a patient who has been prescribed a medication by a licensed physician that their medication is just not available with no explanation. I did not know this though. It took me weeks to learn this. I thought the medication was really out of stock! It took calling other pharmacies and hearing the condescending tone in their nvoice that made me realize this was a catch all resposne to telehealth prescriptions. They even started denying the other script that I had been getting for over 5 years through telehealth! (Suboxone - huge deal to be cut off).\n",

Acting confused changed up the dynamics so much that a few pharmacy techs even explained to me what was actually going on, Walgreens had decided to implement a policy where the prescribing doctor had to be within a 30 mile radius of the patient and had seen the patient in the last year.

Even when I got my supplement prescription, I take a 10 mg extended release once per day and also I'm prescribed a 10 mg instant release once per day, when they added that instant release they were really cool about it too, they even helped reach out to my insurance company to get it covered.\n",

      "Being low in some vitamins can cause low wbc, for instance several of the b vitamins are required.   b12 is the most common one to be low on as it is a big molecule and harder to digest.  SOme people can't digest enough of it even if they eat plenty of food sources with it, and all the more likely if you have bad gut health.  Folate, copper or protein are also needed for production of white blood cells.  In general, copper, iron, vitamin A, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 are specifically associated with the production of blood cells.  b1 is needed for red blood cells.  And there may be others, not sure if I got them all.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also over exercising or endurance sports are known to lessen the body's supply of wbc, the body is really not designed for chronic intense exercise over long periods.   If you exercise a lot and are low in some of these vitamins, that can make it worse, exercise depletes a lot of vitamins like b1. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would make sure all these issues are settled before looking at any more potentially serious issues.  If you have poor gut function or are trying with b12 which many can't digest, you can use sublingual vitamins to bypass the gut.  Some people even have to get occasional b12 injections (which you can do at home).\n",

      "Blood tests for some vitamins like b1 are very inaccurate, the tissues can be low but the body maintains b1 in the blood for heart activity or you would die.  You'd need to do the test for transketolase activity to get an accurate read which I think may not even be available in your area.  However IDK about all the other b vites, you'd need to research them one by one.  But you can see why most peeps just elect to take more of them and see if it seems to help.\n",

      "Thankfully we get the day off on Major Holidays. Unthankfully ADMIN is closed as well and  I am sick have been for several days and it is very likely the transformer variant Omicron. I don't know yet because I was to busy trying to remain alive barely able to move except to sip water or gatorade while looking at the ever increasing temperature reading on my thermometer 104.1 is my record so far? Go me? Currently its at 100.9 so much better than it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ya since the dirty little secret of holiday day entails that you don't get the pay if you don't work the previous and next shifts between that day. I didn't want to call out I really didn't want to I knew probably by about 7 tonight that there was no way I was going to be able to go in.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have to give notice an hour before our shift right? Normally that would be fine just one problem. I open. This morning in 4 hours. I looked up the unum number and called it but an automated message told me UNUM hours and disconnected the call. So clearly not the number I have called before.\n",

      "I seriously considered just calling out ahead of time on Friday Night but figured what kind of lunatic calls out sick over a day before their shift. Now that the temperature isn't as high and hallucinations have faded from the frying of my brain I realize the lunatic is the one who DOESNT call out a day before knowing full well you won't be better a day after having a 104 degree fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But like protocols and all that right. I am pretty damn sure I have it but I have not officially been tested as such have no documented proof to give other than 5 of the 17 people at family christmas party have it. Ive been vaccinated J&J but not boostered (had planned to eventually should have acted sooner) I don't even care about the covid pay my brain and muscles hurt to much for me to care about anything but this hell ending. But I do care about accountability and not being marked as a no call no show because I didn't give an hours notice. When I can't because if I work at 4am and managers enter the building at 345 am wtf am I supposed to do?\n",

I've been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I've called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need.

I found a program called Shire Cares (through the manufacture) that gives you a coupon to get Vyvanse (and some of their other meds) at no cost if you make less than around $80,000. It took around 3 months for it all to go through (they make it difficult for a reason), but I did end up getting it! As a grad student, this was a lifesaver.

When the recession hit the drug companies realized they’d go out of business if they didn’t provide copay assistance.

      "Yay I’m so glad you made this post! Also, I’ve updated one of my responses on the other post but Publix DOES accept GoodRX. If a pharmacy location rejects your discount card or coupon, it’s because the pharmacy manager or district manager is forcing everyone’s hand into not mentioning other discount programs or accepting said discounts, which is NOT okay. If this happens to you, immediately transfer your prescription(s) to a different pharmacy. If this is a regular occurrence at multiple pharmacies in a certain area, go to a different chain or if another city is close enough try one there. I’ve had this happen many times to me when I worked in that field and I feel like it’s totally unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to note would be that if they reject your discount one time, it may not be the same another time. If they tell you their price for a prescription is cheaper than your GoodRX price, this is for a SCRIPT BY SCRIPT BASIS. If they tell you this and their price is cheaper it does NOT mean you can’t use GoodRX there for your other scripts that are cheaper via GoodRx or another site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, a coupon is different from a discount/savings program. A coupon is something you can ONLY get from a manufacturer website (not all discounts from these sites are coupons though) or through your provider if said manufacturer has given them coupons, or sometimes through other programs. It is MANDATORY that these are accepted. An example of a coupon vs savings/discount would be that a coupon would state you can get x quantity for free, but a discount would just lower the cost. Coupons almost always make your prescription cheaper than savings/discount sites and must always be accepted.\n",

So my question is, I found a doctor that will inject my depo shot for cheap but on this list it says that Publix doesn't honor the goodrx coupons for birth control, so should I use something else? Has anyone had experience getting the depo shot from any of the sites mentioned, I checked out the pill club but it doesn't have depo shot as an option which makes sense, but I didn't know if anyone else had any ideas?

      "Yes, you should be able to. When you download the app, you make a profile and the AI, K, will help you out by asking a bunch of questions about your history and symptoms. You pay $14, and then she will connect you to a doctor. Takes 10-20 minutes to have a doctor connect to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the doctor joins chat, they confirm your symptoms, and ask any additional questions they need to know. If you’ve got an anti-depressant you already like that works well with you, let them know what that is, and how long you’ve been off of it. They’ll let you know what they want to prescribe. They should be able to send the prescription directly to your pharmacy, or you can get it from K Health and have it mailed to you. From other comments, it sounds like the cost of meds from the app was comparable to a pharmacy with a discount coupon. \n",

From my own experience though, pet insurance is the most cost effective way to save a ton of money on vet bills and medications for pets. It can be pretty cheap monthly fees depending on the plan you get, and is really worth it if your pet gets sick. Most will cover teeth cleanings too, and some plans even cover getting them fixed.\n",

      "Hey guys I was recently in the spot where I don't have insurance so I can't really afford to see a psychiatrist to get refills. I already have to pay for meds put of pocket. If anyone else is in that position there is an app called 98point6. It's a telemedicine app that's 20 dollars for the year then no further fees. I downloaded it because I was desperate and had a week's worth of my meds left. I talked to a doctor for about an hour and he gave me a refill for everything I needed plus a couple other scripts for other things going on with me. This app saved my sanity. I have a job starting this coming week and not having meds would have probably ruined everything. I can't recommend this enough if you can't see someone to get your refills refreshed.\n",
