      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",

      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",

      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

After struggling with severe back pain and unable to afford a traditional doctor's visit, they paid $20 for a one-year membership, allowing unlimited online consultations. The user described a helpful interaction with a doctor who prescribed an affordable anti-inflammatory medication and utilized GoodRx to find the best price. They praised the service for its convenience and accessibility, particularly for basic medical needs, while acknowledging its limitations for more serious conditions. Other commenters shared their own experiences and thoughts on internet medicine.\n",

One user suggested using Google Voice to create an alternate account for another subscription. Others mentioned options like Doctor on Demand, which is free with certain insurance plans, and CVS Minute Clinic. Additionally, a user provided a link to a compilation of low-cost medical resources. The conversation included some light-hearted banter among participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Reddit user inquired about using the Amazon Care or 98point6 apps to obtain a doctor's note for minor illnesses like food poisoning or a cold. In response, another user noted that their site does not accept doctor's notes for minor ailments unless the illness is severe enough to warrant a medical leave of absence (LOA). A third user added that the doctor's note must be very specific and include three exact details to be accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Reddit user inquired about the 98point6 primary care service for depression treatment. Responses included encouragement for seeking help, with one commenter noting the service's accessibility for physical health but uncertainty about its mental health capabilities. Another user criticized the service, claiming it rarely prescribes medication and often redirects patients to clinics.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user shared their positive experience with a 98point6 text appointment for PCOS management, facilitated by an app that allows 24/7 access to primary care physicians. They successfully obtained lab orders and a prescription for metformin extended release, which their gynecologist had not provided. The user appreciated the convenience of avoiding long waits and copays. In response to a comment, they listed the tests they requested, which included testosterone and glucose levels, noting that most results were normal except for elevated testosterone and lymphocytes.\n",

ChiCroat expressed gratitude for the assistance.\n",

They paid $39, had a brief video consultation, and received assistance in getting their prescription covered by insurance, resulting in no out-of-pocket cost. Other users chimed in with similar experiences using various telehealth services, highlighting the convenience and efficiency of virtual consultations for skincare needs. The discussion also included inquiries about costs and insurance coverage, with many expressing satisfaction with their experiences.\n",

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",

      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",

      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",

      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.

For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages.

      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",

      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",

      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

For anyone who doesn't know, 98point6 is an app that lets you have appointments with PCPs over text messages.

Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!!

I don’t have to rent cars often but the process is so stinking simple with Costco. It was also a minimum of 10 dollars cheaper than I could find anywhere else, usually more, and it was free to reserve. Plus the free additional driver. This was one of the only things about one of my recent trips that went exactly as planned with no complications along the way.\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5h743x by didyouseemynipple on 2022-04-20 [+11 votes] (in reply to i5g414h):\\nThanks for this - I never rent elsewhere again\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5hkuv8 by nicoco2211 on 2022-04-20 [+2 votes] (in reply to i5g414h):\\nInteresting that you’re finding it to be cheaper. I’ve rented through Costco probably half a dozen times and every time the price is the same as I can find renting directly through the car rental company, but I still rent through Costco usually for the free additional driver.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5k0ecs by Spudtater on 2022-04-21 [+2 votes] (in reply to i5g414h):\\nI use this service a lot. A week or so before my trip I will check price again to see if they have dropped. If so I cancel and make a new reservation. I saved around $250 on my last weekly rental doing this. Just the extra driver for free can save you a bundle.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment ID i5gjtw2 by alexdelicious on 2022-04-20 [+43 votes] (in reply to i5fqp30):\\nJust returned a rental in Maui, where everything is super expensive, this morning.

Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.\\n\\n## Comment ID elj1h0o by None on 2019-04-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to bg7ip2):\\nThat sounds like a great resource!

Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\\n\\nA prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\\n\\nControlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\\n\\nSo the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nEDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn\\'t prescribe the thing I\\'d taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I\\'d taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\\n\\n#### Comment ID elkh6df by Mr_Fuzzo on 2019-04-23 [+3 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nControlled substances, for the un-initiated are medications like opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.\\n\\nSo, meds like Xanax, OxyContin, Ritalin, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID eljy54o by AnotherDay_RS on 2019-04-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to eljx9uw):\\nThat\\'s great!!

(I used my insurance to cover the cost of the various labs) I just had a quick follow-up visit (at my desk at work) to get my results five days later.

Some plans (including Figo) do let you add extra riders to pay for routine procedures, but whether it\\'s worth the extra cost probably depends on vet costs in your area.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment ID i5ih6rv by screenwriter61 on 2022-04-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to i5gv6qa):\\nI don\\'t know ANY that cover full dentals as they are so expensive.
