<p><h1>Post 18bymqt:  Powerscribe One -- are you for real? by stumpovich on 2023-12-06 [+10 votes]</h1>
<p>So now that auntminnie is effectively defunct, I figured I would search for help here. If there are any other active forums that someone could point me to that radiologists actually visit, I'd be interested as well.</p>
<p>So, my job finally made the mistake of "upgrading" to PSOne. I could rant for hours about it and not even scratch the surface. I've read horror stories on auntminnie and heard from other radiologists about PSOne, but I was actually impressed to see that it was actually even worse in practice than everyone was saying. I mean -- they eliminated keyboard shortcuts, the UI is disastrous, you need 5-6 extra clicks to do anything you could do in PS360, the macro and report editor is schizophrenic, adding random spaces, new lines, deleting them to the point that it honestly feels like a psychological experiment someone is playing on me, everything requires switching tabs now, you can't pull up the order page without it taking up half the screen, etc.</p>
<p>Now, the one fucking thing that continues to drive me insane 50 times a day is -- clicking at the end of a sentence or anywhere after it (it seems this mostly happens in impression fields, since for some reason in the findings section it works normally, although just like everything in PSOne it is totally inconsistent behavior and sometimes does it, sometimes no), will put your cursor BEFORE the punctuation mark. So anything you say will just be added to the end of the last sentence BEFORE the period, completely fucking up your report. The only way to fix this is, no matter where you click, you then have to press right arrow to get to after the period. How the FUCKKKKKKK was this missed in testing? Like, how the fuck are we supposed to dictate?</p>
<p>Has ANYONE found a solution for this behavior? I am wondering if like, maybe you need some kind of special impression field, some formatting, who the fuck knows. I also wouldn't be surprised if other people using PSOne don't experience this, because the software is THAT fucking inconsistent.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<h2>Comment kc7nmgx by MocoMojo on 2023-12-06 [+8 votes] (in reply to 18bymqt):</h2>
<p>It’s horrible. </p>
<p>In addition, our PACS (Visage) now crashes 2-4 times a day (the is never happened with PS360).</p>
<h3>Comment kc7qy0x by tell_her_a_story on 2023-12-06 [+3 votes] (in reply to kc7nmgx):</h3>
<p>We're running Sectra with PS One, seeing at least 4 crashes per day on average. We've found that it's delays in PSOne causing Sectra to believe that PSOne has disconnected from the integrated system and locking everything up. </p>
<p>It's been a nightmare since we upgraded in July with nothing helpful coming from Nuance support.</p>
<h3>Comment kc7o1wp by stumpovich on 2023-12-06 [+1 votes] (in reply to kc7nmgx):</h3>
<p>Do you experience the same punctuation issues? Yeah we got Visage so it's a net upgrade overall but oh my god, why couldn't they just keep PS360. Literally any radiologist who has ever talked to ANYONE who has used PSOne should know that that is a piece of software that must be avoided AT ALL COSTS.</p>
<h4>Comment kc7qgqt by MocoMojo on 2023-12-06 [+1 votes] (in reply to kc7o1wp):</h4>
<p>I didn’t have this specific issue but a friend in my group had it. It somehow got fixed (not sure how, unfortunately). </p>
<p>Our group made the switch because all the servers can be housed on-site, which the admins said would save lots of money (won’t say how much, though). </p>
<p>Also, I like to use a stand alone mic instead of the mic in the dictaphone (gives me elbow issues). PSone won’t recognize the stand alone mic and after 2 weeks of IT support nobody can figure out why. So now in addition to everything else, my elbow hurts.</p>

<p>That was one of the first problems I noticed. My solution was to program one of the mic buttons to put the cursor at the end of the current line.</p>

<p>I use a boom mic, but yeah, I will have to write an AHK macro to do that. That's a good idea. Hilarious that we have to resort to these workarounds to like .... PUT THE CURSOR WHERE I'M TRYING TO BY CLICKING ON IT.</p>
<h2>Comment l6hp4ey by nufan333 on 2024-05-31 [+1 votes] (in reply to 18bymqt):</h2>
<p>For those of you who have upgraded to PSOne and have had issues, which version did you upgrade to? There is PSOne core version (looks and feels like PS360, but updated engine), and the PSOne UX version (the ‘new’ powerscribe with new UI and bells and whistles that they show at RSNA and has gotten the bad reviews). </p>
<p>We need to upgrade from 360 and have choice between PSOne Core and UX. Am told by vendor that new UX version received a service patch in last few months and has now been getting good reviews, with a lot of the issues discussed in this thread being fixed. Have held off on upgrading for over 2 years given all the bad reviews and budget, but now need to for technical reasons. Wondering if anyone is on this new UX version (since service patch) and can share their experience?</p>
<h3>Comment l8e5y3c by stumpovich on 2024-06-13 [+1 votes] (in reply to l6hp4ey):</h3>
<p>No. Use the old PS360 UI with the updated engine. Do NOT use the new UI.</p>
<h4>Comment l8f1elo by nufan333 on 2024-06-13 [+1 votes] (in reply to l8e5y3c):</h4>
<p>Thanks, I saw your original post which was very helpful. Wondering have they updated you to the new service pack (came out earlier this year) since you started with the new UI? Nuance has told us the initial new UI version was bad for many of the reasons you mentioned (which means it must have been very bad for the company to take ownership of it) but has now been fixed. Wondering if that’s sales reps doing their job, or they actually fixed things.</p></p>

<p><h1>Post 18oytib:  Is the Grey Matter DNA Asmuths? by PhoonThe on 2023-12-23 [+993 votes]</h1>
<p>I think that asmuth put in his dna into the omnitrix. Asmuth has shown to put alien dna that are at the prime of their species. So what if asmuth thought “oh I’m the best galvin, my dna should go into the omnitrix”.  I feel like it fits with his cocky attitude.</p>

<p>You know you’d think but apparently there’s WOG statements that say it’s not him or Albedo for whatever reason </p>
<p>Makes no sense whatsoever to me why Azmuth WOULDN’T just prick his own finger sounds like the easiest option if nothing else to me but whatever </p>
<p>However it Has lead me to develop the head cannon that the Galvan donor was Zenith (Azmuth’s ex who we saw in the flash back episode of the Dagon arc who left him) because perhaps he considers HER the best of the Galvan species rather than himself (would also make sense given the context from the flashback)</p>

<p>It fits young Azmuth's ego too. Of course he'd be the best sample for a "peak" Galvin. I headcanon he imparted some of his general knowledge into the Galvin transformation that's why Grey Matter can understand complex scientific facts and build technology on the fly.</p>

<p>Azmuth isolated himself in a backwater planet before being persuaded to go back to Galvan, not exactly the kind of guy you'd expect to give away his genome. That being said, wasn't the Omnitrix originally signed with his DNA before his assistant tampered with it?</p>
<h2>Comment keknx6v by Independent_Peace144 on 2023-12-23 [+21 votes] (in reply to 18oytib):</h2>
<p>Smart =/= wisdom and knowledge. Azmuth is the wisest and most knowledgeable Galvan, but may not be the smartest. He has accumulated years of wisdom to become where he is right now. You can be smart and don't know anything if you never bothered to learn. Given Ben's lack of experience compared to Azmuth it makes sense why he seemed to be not as "smart"</p>

<p>Since it isn’t Azmuth’s DNA, does that mean that Ben has the potential to become smarter than Azmuth? Since he’s the prime example of the species</p>
<h3>Comment kemmrdx by Pen_isnt on 2023-12-23 [+2 votes] (in reply to kelpnaw):</h3>
<p>I assume if Ben was as old as Azmuth and turned into Grey Matter he’d be as smart if not smarter than Azmuth. But Frankenstrike has no intelligence boost despite Dr Victor, and his DNA was the one scanned as well, as intelligence is something Dr Victor just has, not an ability of his species, so it’s possible Ben would still not be as smart as Azmuth anyway since his intelligence is above that what a Galvan can achieve even with years of evolution, as Ultimate Albedo still wasn’t as smart as Azmuth either.</p>

<p>You can't be smart if you don't know shit. In theory, if Ben were to turn in Gray Matter for a looooong time and started studying and doing researchs, then eventually he would become smarter. But since he obviously ain't doing none of that, his smart is limited.</p>

<p>The omnitrix randomises it and alters it to become a prime specimen. Ben is about as related to Azmuth as Eunice is to any human on the planet. Why are we still having these conversations ? Did you guys watch the show on YouTube ? How are you missing all this. Albedo in omniverse specifically changed the Galvan DNA in his ultimatrix from his own to Azmuth’s own. As seen in the episode where him and Vilgax team up to kill Azmuth and Ben.</p>
<h2>Comment kemusao by SuperMegaGoji on 2023-12-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to 18oytib):</h2>
