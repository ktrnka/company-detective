            <h1>Summary of 98point6 Glassdoor Reviews</h1>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
- Some team managers are described as good and responsive (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW83458845.htm">Software Engineer, 2024-01-17</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>

- The firing of a well-liked CEO and subsequent reorganization has led to low morale and a toxic atmosphere (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm">Software Engineer, 2023-06-21</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Quotations:</strong>
- "Communication overall has been terrible with 'we don't know yet' being the usual answer for any concerns." (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm">Software Engineer, 2023-06-21</a>)
- "Exec team doesn't seem to have long term strategy." (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW83458845.htm">Software Engineer, 2024-01-17</a>)</p>
<h2>Compensation and Benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
- Previously, the company was noted for good pay, but this has changed due to a focus on frugality (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm">Software Engineer, 2023-06-21</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
- Employees have reported no raises and unfulfilled promises regarding bonuses (Software Development Engineer, 2024-06-11).</p>
<h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>

- The company is noted to lack diversity (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW85303799.htm">Backend Software Engineer, 2024-03-13</a>).</p>
<h2>Work-Life Balance</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>

<h2>Growth Opportunities</h2>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
- Employees feel that the company lacks a clear vision and long-term strategy, which may hinder growth opportunities (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW86345200.htm">Software Engineer, 2024-04-15</a>).</p>
<h2>Company Culture</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
- Many reviews highlight a collegial atmosphere and the presence of smart, nice people (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW85303799.htm">Backend Software Engineer, 2024-03-13</a>; Customer Success Manager, 2024-05-10).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>

<h2>Changes Over Time</h2>
<p>The company has undergone significant changes, including leadership turnover, layoffs, and a shift in focus that has led to a decline in employee morale and satisfaction. The once positive work environment has been marred by instability and poor communication.</p>
<h2>Relationship Between Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction</h2>
<p>Job functions appear to correlate with employee satisfaction, as those in supportive roles (like direct managers) tend to receive more positive feedback, while those in technical roles express dissatisfaction with leadership and strategic direction.</p>
<h2>Questions for Leadership</h2>
<ol>
<li>What specific steps are being taken to improve communication and transparency within the company?</li>
<li>How does the leadership plan to address the concerns regarding diversity and inclusion?</li>
<li>Can you provide clarity on the company's long-term strategy and vision moving forward?</li>
