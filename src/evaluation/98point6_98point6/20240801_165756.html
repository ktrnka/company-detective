        <p class="about">Notes: 
            We process fewer threads than the search results mainly to save OpenAI costs. Sometimes we also filter search results if there aren't enough comments, or if we detect significant hallucination in the LLM summary of the individual thread.
            The threads are flattened and shortened to fit within the LLM context length. Very deep comment threads may be cut off, as well as very long threads.
            We also filter out comment trees with a negative score.

<h4>Key Aspects</h4>
<h5>Leadership</h5>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reports of inequity in treatment based on gender and race, particularly in the medical group (e.g., "expect to be addressed by your first name" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW62449921.htm">Physician on 2022-04-07</a>)).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High workloads and expectations can lead to stress, impacting work-life balance (e.g., "People across all departments leave 98point6 for ridiculous compensation increases" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW61107869.htm">Anonymous on 2022-03-13</a>)).</li>

<li>Some employees feel there are opportunities to grow and learn (e.g., "Great place to work if you want to get deep on a set of problems" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW72835871.htm">Anonymous on 2023-01-20</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limited advancement options and a tendency for employees to become pigeonholed in their roles (e.g., "Not many advancement options" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW72835871.htm">Anonymous on 2023-01-20</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Company Culture</h5>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The company culture is often described as positive, with a strong mission and friendly environment (e.g., "the people, the mission, so organized and friendly" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW70903749.htm">Anonymous on 2022-11-08</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reports of a toxic culture, particularly after leadership changes, with issues like micromanagement and lack of psychological safety (e.g., "massive changes and terrible communication" (<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW77606714.htm">Software Engineer on 2023-06-21</a>)).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changes Over Time</h4>
<p>The company has experienced significant changes, particularly in leadership and structure. The departure of key executives and subsequent layoffs have led to a decline in morale and employee satisfaction. Many employees feel that the company is no longer the same as it was a year ago, with a shift towards a more toxic environment and a lack of clear direction.</p>
<h4>Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction</h4>
<p>Employee satisfaction appears to vary significantly by job function. While some roles, particularly in clinical and technical areas, report high levels of stress and dissatisfaction due to management issues and workload, others, especially in supportive roles, express contentment with their work environment and the mission of the company.</p>
<h4>Questions for Leadership</h4>
<ol>
<li>What specific steps are being taken to improve communication and transparency within the company?</li>
<li>How does leadership plan to address the concerns regarding compensation and ensure it is competitive?</li>
<li>What initiatives are in place to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the workforce?</li>
<li>Can you elaborate on the long-term strategy for the company following recent leadership changes?</li>
<li>How does the company plan to support employee growth and advancement in their careers?</li>
<li>What measures are being implemented to improve the company culture and address reports of toxicity?</li>
<li>How does leadership intend to gather and act on employee feedback moving forward?</li>
</ol>
