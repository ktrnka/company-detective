# 1 stars by [Anonymous on 2022-01-11](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW57771728.htm)

A lot of this has been said

## Pros

Great goals - to improve access and quality of healthcare for all. A desire for diversity.

## Cons

The interview process is your first indication: this is a technical company trying to do everything measurable and data-based. But with the usual problem of humans not being able to understand their biases and produce valid measures. Having interviewed and been interviewed, I've seen both signs.
Then once you get on board, there's a lot to be celebrated (along with celebrations of people and the 'fun' environment). 
However, you soon realize that this is basically another Amazon in disguise. It makes sense when you consider that the CTO and CPO (along with CMO and many others in leadership roles) are ex-Amazonians. There's a complete lack of understanding of how human beings work, which leads to politics, bullying, exclusion and a lack of pyschological safety. If you're part of the in crowd (and you have enough emotional intelligence to realize that you are - and that other people are also valuable) you're golden. You can do and say what you want, and your voice is heard. If not, it's like being the odd kid out on the playground. 
The sad part is that many people want to get feedback and grow, however leadership has proven that they don't hear it - or can't.

## Advice to management

Stop using your background to assess others. Listen to feedback. Ensure that feedback can be given anonymously. Act on it. 
Value all employees, regardless of role. 
Learn emotional intelligence and organizational psychology.

Refusal to Listen to Employees

## Pros

It is extremely rewarding to work for a company with a mission like 98point6. Everyone at the company has this common motiving factor to better healthcare and strive to help people. Additionally the PTO and time-off are better than most companies.

## Cons

Outside of what I have included in the pros, everything else in a con. The biggest two factors are terrible managers and extremely weak pay. I have never worked harder in my career then I did at 98point6 and the company pays extremely low, even for a start-up. People across all departments leave 98point6 for ridiculous compensation increases. Similar to other reviews, it seems like HR refuses to listen to complaints or utilize data to improve known problems. Internal complaints go no where and annual merit increases are a joke. 

About a year into joining, everyone quickly realizes the pros of the company mission are far outweighed by the lack of compensation, tone deaf leadership, and huge work loads. There has been a max exodus from the company for the last couple months in addition to the CEO, CPO, and CTO all departing the company. It does seem like the writing is on the wall and employees are showing their feedback by departing the company since it seems to be the only way to be heard.

## Advice to management

None


# 2 stars by [Physician on 2022-04-07](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW62449921.htm)

Ineffective clinical leadership with boys' club attitude and yes-men mentality

## Pros

The technology is great and it was great to be a part of a company that created an amazing new experience in healthcare. The company was great to work at in the beginning, with strong values and a motivating initial CEO/leader.

## Cons

The clinical side was a mess with poor leadership. 

There are some medical leaders who care only about optics and some who have been promoted without delivered anything successful. There is a command-and-control and boy's club mentality that apparently continues to persist, with senior leaders on the medical side who have no basic management or organization skills creating more confusion and lack of progress. Turf wars impacted real collaboration and progress and, while every every organization has behind the door conversations, you will leave with a sort of PTSD related to that. 

And if you're a female physician or a minority physician, expect to be addressed by your first name, while your white male and military-associated counterparts are often addressed with their titles or a bro-club collegial nickname. Not that you care about titles, but how can you NOT notice inequity?

An amazing and wonderful place

## Pros

the people, the mission, so organized and friendly, on a mission to improve healthcare and behavioral health is valued.

## Cons

Nothing, it is a steep learning curve but fun to learn.

## Advice to management

Nothing so far. Keep this amazing culture going. I think the Meet and Greets are a great idea to build community culture in the virtual world. I'm impressed with the culture, so friendly and respectful.

Wonderful Experience

## Pros

The company is very proactive in making sure their employees are happy and heard. They are very open with the business model. It has been a wonderful experience as a Physician. The medical group collaborates with one another. You definitely feel like you are part of a team from day 1.

## Cons

Training is an adjustment because you are learning the system and there is so much information in a short period of time.

None


# 4 stars by [Anonymous on 2023-01-20](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW72825995.htm)

Not many advancement options

## Pros

Great place to work if you want to get deep on a set of problems that has huge human impact.

## Cons

You are somewhat expected to go deep on a problem, and remain the IC expert there permanently. My experience has been that manager changes do not take into account the alignment of that manager's experience and the domain of the team they are taking over.

Not the worst experience, but not great either

## Pros

The benefits offered are on the better end.

## Cons

The management isn’t great- their inexperience in such roles definitely show in really cruddy ways. Micromanagement and shaming is common. There is a clear hierarchy in a negative way with preferential treatment. The company also speak to the idea of being transparent, but it is a facade.

## Advice to management

Get better, more experienced people in the roles, especially in the Behavioral Health sector.


# 5 stars by [Anonymous on 2023-02-13](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-98point6-RVW73579833.htm)

Mission Driven

## Pros

Remote work, great co-workers, exciting product. I feel like the company is moving in the right direction. Also, 2 weeks off at the end of the year is fantastic!

## Cons

Tech debt from a legacy product has taken time to work through and can be a little frustrating.

Great place to work with collaborative teams

## Pros

I worked at 98point6 for 3 years before the clinical operations moved to Transcarent. It was the best 3 years of my 20+ year career. So many opportunities to grow and no micromanagement. I wish 98point6 Tech the best of luck on their future path!

## Cons

The usual cons of a startup.

Nice mission, good people but things did change

## Pros

One of the places I was most proud to work at in my longish career, and a really great mission to aspire for and realize.

## Cons

Over time after the CEO was fired and the whole fallout poorly handled, morale visibly dipped - mine included and a lot of folks from my team all left. Eventually I did too.

## Advice to management

Just stay genuine to what you truly believe. Don't say stuff that even you would have a hard time believing but have to say for the sake of keeping morale up. Its been a while since I have left, to be fair - so things may or may not be better now.

Massive Changes and Terrible Communication

## Pros

It used to pay well but there have been a lot of changes and emphasis on frugality. Fully remote work. Some team managers are good people to work for. This doesn't make up for the cons.

## Cons

It's not at all the same company at it was a year ago, but it is pitched as "many new opportunities" and "good problems to have". The well-liked CEO was fired about a year ago a lot of good employees left. Since then the exec level has had multiple reorgs and the healthcare part of the company was sold. Then there were layoffs and more employees at all levels left on their own. Goals have not changed. More have been added and all dead lines were kept the same. Of course when these deadlines are not met the next company meeting is negative with a lot of general blaming and saying we all just need to work harder. Communication overall has been terrible with "we don't know yet" being the usual answer for any concerns. Weeks without answers. Any answers are just as rushed and poorly thought out as the changes. This toxic attitude is starting with the top level but you can see it affecting teams as they feel more pressure.

## Advice to management

There are a lot of things to say but none of them matter because of how leadership behaves.

# Summary of 98point6 Technologies

## Company Overview
98point6 Technologies is a Seattle-based health tech company that specializes in licensed on-demand virtual care software. Founded in 2015, the company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its technology to healthcare providers. The flagship product, the 98point6 Technology Platform, is a cloud-based software solution that integrates artificial intelligence with automated clinical standards to enhance virtual care delivery.

## Key Developments

### Acquisitions
- **Bright.md**: On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which includes 16 customer contracts and the sales and customer success teams. This acquisition is part of a strategy to enhance its asynchronous care capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to communicate with patients at their convenience ([PR Newswire, Jan 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).

### Partnerships
- **SteadyMD**: In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution.

### Fundraising and Financials
- In late 2020, 98point6 raised $118 million in funding, which significantly boosted its operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company has faced challenges, including a high-profile leadership shakeup and layoffs in 2022 and 2024, as it transitions to a licensing model ([Pragmatic DLT, Apr 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

### Business Model Transformation
- The company has shifted from direct healthcare services to a licensing model for its software solutions. This strategic pivot is aimed at achieving more stable and recurring revenue streams while addressing the financial pressures faced by many health tech companies post-pandemic ([Healthcare Dive, Jan 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).

## Market Position and User Base

## Opinions and Challenges
The company has received mixed opinions regarding its transition to a licensing model, with some experts noting that while this could lead to more sustainable growth, it also raises concerns about job security and the impact of layoffs on the local tech ecosystem ([Pragmatic DLT, Apr 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).

## Conclusion
