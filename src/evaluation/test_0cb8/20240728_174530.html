<li>"An experienced shopper with the store usually finds 19 items out of 20, and replaces that 1 item with something similar based on past experience. Whereas, with a lot of newbies, they will find 14-15 items and refund the 5-6 while spending much more time." (source: 1bzu33v)</li>

<h2>Original Thread</h2>
<p><h1>Post 1ad7vuv:  What TF Happened To Instacart? by killbillsfatbitch on 2024-01-28 [+64 votes]</h1>
<p>So I used to make $400-$500 a week using Instacart. When considering this was during the peak of the COVID pandemic, that was still pretty good profit. I got another job so dropped Instacart for about a year and a half. Now, I’m back on and the batches SUCK ASS. </p>
<p>2-3 years ago, you’d get offered $70 or over for three orders in one batch. Now, I’m seeing three orders in one batch for like $25-$30. I just saw one batch that was over 30 items with a payout of only $12. What kind of profit is that when you consider all the gas you’re using during delivery?? I live in Wilmington, Delaware - so I get offered batches even in Glen Mills, PA and Philly - so theres an ABUNDANCE of grocery stores. It’s just ridiculous how much Instacart has fallen off. </p>
<p>I’m sure it’s due to people not wanting to tip (and I understand that they don’t have to), the company being cheap, and more competitive delivery services are out now. But damn, Instacart unfortunately isn’t worth it anymore.</p>
<h2>Comment kjzaocv by Comprehensive-Young5 on 2024-01-28 [+32 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>several of my local grocery store started offerin delivery and they have better promotion than instacart and the prices stays the same as in the store</p>
<h3>Comment kk45ybe by Middle-Yam8239 on 2024-01-29 [+15 votes] (in reply to kjzaocv):</h3>
<p>Replying to killbillsfatbitch...
Funny thing is that most of them use Instacart or DoorDash to do the shop. I'm a shopper for IC and the app will literally tell me not to mention Instacart to the customer, because they may be confused as they did not order through Instacart but through a store like Costco or giant. It's like why can't I mention Instacart, just seems kind of odd.</p>
<h4>Comment kk507ie by Personal-One-4572 on 2024-01-29 [+8 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>I find that odd as well because when I order delivery off of the McDonald's app it tells me that it'll be delivered via doordash</p>
<h4>Comment kk46wlw by Top-Obligation-8732 on 2024-01-29 [+3 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>I use stopandshop and they actually have a designated truck specifically for delivering. But for Walmart yea they use DoorDash,Instacart etc</p>

<p>Exactly! Kroger uses instacart, tells you it does on the app, but guess what? I get to tip the driver but I don't have to kick back at least $10 to Instacart, PLUS I get Kroger in-store prices and get to use their coupons. When my IC+ membership is done later this year, I'm done with it.</p>

<p>Just tell them. It's a crap deal because you could go above and beyond. Ex. Driving 15 mins, No parking for a city apartment and have to carry 14 bags and 2 cases of water across a highway and into a locked access building.. take it up 3 floors and then place it inside for a customer all for $14. 
Then the customer cannot increase your tip or leave you positive comments on IC. I'll no longer pickup  bags at the grocery store. The last straw was a pickup 12 bags, drive 6 miles into the middle of nowhere for $4.76, no tip haha </p>

<p>That is odd. I do ubereats and deliver walmart orders often, whenever i need to call i say hi I'm ____, your ubereats driver assigned to deliver your walmart order. Never seen anything tell me not to mention I'm with a different company. I'm still new to instacart so I'm yet to see this on there either.</p>

<p>Hopefully more states/municipalities start doing what Cali and Seattle have done. It’s actually sustainable in Seattle now but it’s only within city limits, so places like shoreline/Bothell/Edmonds or Bellevue/Kirkland/Redmond are just as trash to work in as the rest of the country. Maybe somewhat better since people swarmed to the city for orders, leaving batches easier to grab, but I haven’t bothered. The guaranteed minimum removes the more stressful parts of the job for me.</p>
<h2>Comment kk0am38 by Emergency_Holiday_49 on 2024-01-28 [+11 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>In my area they've completely oversaturated the market with HORRIBLE shoppers!! I live in a really good IC area with customers that have money &amp; love the idea of not having to go to the grocery store, along with tourists that are usually always very generous while they're down here on vacation. But because IC has now prioritized batches to shoppers that accept a lot of orders instead of prioritizing them to the 5-star shoppers like they used to, so many of the good customers have stopped using the service and/or have reduced their default tip from 20% to 10% or less, and will increase with excellent service. Unfortunately, you don't know which they are, so you have to accept low paying orders to find out which ones they are. Personally, I'm not willing to accept low paying orders to find out. I've come across FIVE customers recently that I used to deliver to regularly, when IC prioritized to 5-star shoppers, that used to have a 20% default tip, that now have it set at 10% because of all the terrible shoppers they get now. IC has shot themselves in the foot, and I'm assuming their bottom line, by hiring so many new shoppers that don't know what their doing &amp; most don't seem to care, in order to get the low &amp; no-tip orders picked up. It's a shame because it is a really great service. Unfortunately it's not great anymore, but simply a DD that delivers groceries instead of restaurant food. #bringbackapoorva</p>

<p>Prices being higher than in store, plus the fees, plus the fact that Walmart+ has been getting good reviews is driving customers away from IC and shrinking their tips when they do use it. As a customer, it feels like a rip off and the shoppers suffer as a result. And in classic shitty company style - they pit the shoppers against the customers.
Walmart literally incentivizes online shopping with better prices than in store (sometimes). I used to use instacart more often when the stores in my area offered in-store prices. Some of them have changed that, so now I'll go without until I can go in myself.</p>

<p>So, when you list the reasons why Instacart became a shitty place to work for - please don't blame clients and no tipping. Blame the Instacart itself only and only.</p>
<h2>Comment l2vfdol by ovalleysuszee on 2024-05-06 [+2 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>What happened to Instacart is they got too expensive and people like me quit using them. I had been using them even before the pandemic, and I didn't mind paying a tip or even a little extra for the groceries. What I do mind is having to pay their new service fee. I have found that I can shop through the Kroger Boost app or on Walmart Plus, pay in-store prices, and not have to pay a service fee at all. Today I was shopping for an Aldi order and IC wanted a $12 service fee, on top of what I was tipping. I switched over to the Kroger app, still paid the same tip for the shopper, saved money because Kroger prices were cheaper, and came out almost $30 less on my total.  </p>
<p>And this is why people aren't using Instacart.</p>

<p>this terable componey has people working 5 hours to end up only making 15 dollars. Worst part is that even thogh they break minimum wage laws they get away with this thievery.

Because they need that money to feed there obease boys. The goverment pays for it to throgh food stamps.

<h1>Never had a shopper like this by Inside_Ninja4264 on 2024-01-22</h1>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19cne6y">https://www.reddit.com/gallery/19cne6y</a>

The Reddit thread discusses a negative experience with an Instacart shopper who replaced items with more expensive alternatives and was rude to the customer. The discussion includes various user experiences, employee perspectives, and insights into Instacart's pricing practices.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"I’ve been using instacart for years on a weekly basis and I normally get the sweetest most helpful shoppers." (source: kj433o6)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"Every single item he replaced things with were all more expensive, and then he replaced the digestive enzymes which were $3 with something that was $45 and said it’s on sale. And then snapped at me." (source: 19cne6y)</li>
<li>"I had a shopper in 2021, when my aunt was dying of COVID, tell me if I wanted specific yogurts like I did for my medically fragile child, I should get off my lazy ass and do it myself." (source: kj0pkjs)</li>
<li>"The one and only time I used Instacart the guy subbed & charged my card for two $50 bottles of Hennessy for himself, then showed up drunk at my house and delivered me a sack of potatoes (??) and none of the groceries I had ordered." (source: kj5zelx)</li></ul>

<h2>Employee Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>



<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"The pay from instacart typically only covers the expense of driving it to you, and they keep lowering it more constantly. It actually used to be a good side gig, but it’s definitely not anymore." (source: kj1aq16)</li></ul>

<h2>Investor Perspective</h2>

<ul><li>"Instacart and DoorDash have labeled prices more than what it is if you actually went in to the store or restaurant they’re trying to add in a dollar here or a dollar there to make extra money." (source: kj4pl8k)</li></ul>

<p>Every single item he replaced things with were all more expensive, and then he replaced the digestive enzymes which were $3 with something that was $45 and said it’s on sale.

<p>I’ve had this happen recently with a drive up order from a big box store and a door dash order…it’s maddening.  The big box store order was for 3 medium sized items and the person that brought them out to me gave me a hard time until I pointed out that I have a little baby in the back and it’s flu/rsv season.  The door dasher gave me a hard time for ordering from a restaurant super close to my house but I told them I’m sick and can’t leave so that’s why I tipped so well and it’s a quick order.  I tipped like $10 on an order that was literally like 3 blocks distance.</p>

<p>I've never had it that bad but close. I told one that I was pregnant and that I'm due any day now. They treat you like you're just being lazy for not going to the store yourself. Those are usually the ones who have the nerve to bitch about the pay and want a higher tip. They always say it's the app that's not paying your driver is enough but it's like if you don't want to do the job then don't do the job. Go find a different job. Stop taking it out on the customers because the app is greedy.</p>

<p>I feel so incredibly lucky... I've got celiacs disease so I have to be very careful about brands and flavors. One of my requested items was out of stock tonight so I said a refund would be fine since I've had issues with some of the common replacements. The shopper took the time to find a brand that was both gluten free and didn't have the other grain I'm sensitive to. And she's not the first! I swear, they're more careful about checking labels and finding new foods I can eat than I am!</p>

<p>It’s never happened before. I’ve been using instacart for years on a weekly basis and I normally get the sweetest most helpful shoppers. Only one time have I had a bad shopper but he wasn’t rude to me or anything, just got all wrong items. This is why I have my tip automatically set to 20%, I’m always happy with the service 99.999% of the time. I still am, just a uncomfortable with that interaction.

<p>This guy knows that you will be paying what instacart is saying you will pay. He also knows that if the tip is a percentage, he will get more money if you pay more, which is probably why he is subbing larger more expensive items and trying to tell you that they're 'on sale' or some crap. I would report this guy.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure; people say the stores jack up the prices, and some say instacart jacks up the prices. They probably both do it to a certain extent. I have seen people saying that some stores won't jack up prices on things that are necessities, like bread, eggs, etc but they do so on things like snacks and soda and possibly, pizza. I guess in the end, greed is why, because instacart is also charging service fees and delivery fees and other fees on top of the jacked up price. The stores I guess want a bigger profit on the service as well maybe.</p>

<p>Instacart an store make a set price for each item. You will not pay store price on most items. They are a reseller of items. You get a receipt in ur email. Never a paper one.</p>

<p>Instacart literally tells shoppers not to include a paper receipt in the bag for this exact reason (current shopper).</p>

<p>They don’t go by the store prices that’s how they can afford to pay these people they have to make money somehow paying for all these people shopping and delivering but they should go by store receipt but they definitely don’t so I don’t know why he’s lying to her and getting mad I think he was trying to be sneaky and is a sociopath or narcissist and thought he’d get away with it hoping you wouldn’t argue</p>

<p>They upcharge so they can make profit. They have their own sales, not related to the stores. Shoppers are instructed not to give you a paper receipt as you are basically buying from instacart not the store.</p>
<h4>Comment kj5pf2y by HuckerDisc on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Instacart loves sale items. They’ll charge you full price and make their money from the sale price. Maybe why they always show the buyer lots of items that are on “sale”.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6380n by gremlinsbuttcrack on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Yeah instacart shoppers are told all over the app not to leave the receipt behind so customers don't realize how much they're upcharged</p>
<h4>Comment kj63qwo by Le_loup on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Yeah I’m pretty sure that Instacart tells you if it’s the same price in-store, or not (marked up). Most orders I’ve made have been marked up. It’s not shady, they’re transparent about pricing.</p>

<p>Because Instacart does not charge in store prices. Everything is marked up and it says this on their website. It is roughly 15% markup and likely you will not get in store prices.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6fd35 by b1ackcr0vv on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>There’s a reason the shoppers aren’t supposed to give you the paper receipt. Instacart sets their own prices, will put the same items on sale as at the store, but for their own prices. It’s how they make money.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6gflk by NeighborhoodFront229 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Think you gotta load the coupons in app to get the sale price when you are placing you're order. Otherwise its full price or whatever app says but if you click on the sales/deals and apply it you can get the sales is how it works basically</p>
<h4>Comment kj6md5f by TheHumbleKatsu on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Because p2p delivery services had a service charge to every item that is ordered Instacart is the worse, but all of them do it, everything is going to cost more if you have it delivered through the app.</p>

<p>IC charges around 10% or more for every item bought and adds 10% on the end plus delivery fees ect.  Unfortunately, the delivery driver don't get much of that. Drivers make on average $10 per order anda lott of the time that includes tips.  What they charge is on the agreement that everyone signs people just don't read it.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6rlxl by Beginning_Alps_1817 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>The stores set the prices. Not IC. IC charges the stores a %, they can either offer in-store pricing on the app, and eat that cost themselves…or mark up the cost on the app. </p>
<p>The only time the Customer gets the sale prices is if it’s in the app. If it’s not listed as a sale price in the app, it will get rung up at the register as a sale price, but you won’t get charged any differently. IC keeps the difference.</p>

<p>Instacart buys the goods from the store and they can resell them to you at whatever price they want.  Very few stores on Instacart will give you the in-store price on goods.  The pricing policy for each store can be found in-app.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6ukkt by kukumonkey854 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Yes, but they tell you their prices are different (not defending them, just saying this is known to be the case). If you click on the store name on Instacart then "pricing policy" it will usually say it's different than in person.</p>
<h4>Comment kj72on9 by KasLea82 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>The price on Instacart is always higher than in the store. It’s the same thing with DoorDash. If you compare menu item prices say Panera’s app for pickup versus delivery, the price is higher for delivery. And then there’s the delivery fee on top of the higher prices. It’s all a racket. Do your own shopping and get your own food. They’re charging higher prices for the convenience and their cost of operations.</p>

<p>Delivery companies are going to up charge you how do you think they’re able to pay people to deliver ? My fare from instacart is usually only $8-10 and then whatever the customer tips and it’s a lot of work.</p>

<p>The tip is whatever the customer chooses though. You can enter it as a percentage, or a flat dollar amount, or you can enter no tip. The shopper is likely screwing himself out of a tip altogether by acting this way.</p>
<h4>Comment kj1u1gz by quantumcalicokitty on 2024-01-22 [+52 votes] (in reply to kj1kk4l):</h4>
<p>Yeah, but you often place a tip before ordering. The drivers see it before accepting the order. If the person placing the order isn't paying attention, or is perhaps susceptible to manipulation (elderly, young adult, disability, etc), then the tip will go up for the driver.</p>
<p>That being said, tips <em>can</em> be adjusted for a time after the delivery is made.</p>
<p>The shopper was trying to make himself more money, that's just the truth. And, I'm sure the scam absolutely works at times.</p>
<h4>Comment kj1urwh by Wamblingshark on 2024-01-22 [+8 votes] (in reply to kj1kk4l):</h4>
<p>Tip may not always be a percentage but unless it's changed from when I was a shopper it certainly seemed like the base pay was something plus a percentage.</p>
<p>If I refunded anything the base pay went down and if stuff was more expensive or got added I got paid more.</p>
<p>I would never behave like this guy did though. Even if I had no morals, this is a great way to lose a tip altogether.</p>

<h1>The reason why instacart is losing customers  by DalaiRamen on 2024-04-09</h1>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1bzu33v/the_reason_why_instacart_is_losing_customers/">https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1bzu33v/the_reason_why_instacart_is_losing_customers/</a>

The Reddit thread discusses various reasons why Instacart is losing customers, with a focus on the impact of new shoppers, high costs, and competition from other services.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"I am still very grateful that the service and you shoppers are out there." (source: kyt5tr7)</li>
<li>"I also pay $3 for Priority because in my experience - since using it for the past year - is that I get consistently get better professional shoppers." (source: kyt0uos)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"An experienced shopper with the store usually finds 19 items out of 20, and replaces that 1 item with something similar based on past experience. Whereas, with a lot of newbies, they will find 14-15 items and refund the 5-6 while spending much more time." (source: 1bzu33v)</li>
<li>"Moldy produce, items not in cold bags when it's 90 degrees, expired items, deliver to wrong apartment door, wrong items, not getting the replacement I asked for in my notes if something is out, missing items that are in the store." (source: kyvv4gz)</li>
<li>"Instacart charges even more now, pays shoppers less and from reading this sub, shoppers expect the customer to make up the difference with higher tips by begging on chat which is a huge turnoff." (source: kysnaca)</li>
<li>"I get my produce daily on the last shop of the day). Anyway I tell them I'll be tipping them based off the job they do, and I put it as no tip and was hoping to just snag the order myself. I finish my drop off and check in, I ordered 2 pounds of hanger steak...the app shows 1.02 pounds, ordered 2.5lbs ground sirloin, shows 1.26, so I message him asking if that's all they had, in the hanger steak and asked them to get another package of the ground sirloin(there was 50 packs of the ground sirloin, 30 minutes prior). They respond saying nothing but it is hanger steak I got it at the counter.....no more communication." (source: kyszx00)</li></ul>

<h2>Employee Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"They provide the tools to be a good shopper which is inherently easy." (source: kys7nv9)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"Know wonder 3 C level positions left last month. Must be all the games they play with people's money and experienced shoppers." (source: kyssffa)</li>
<li>"Shoppers go into this thinking how hard could it be it’s shopping for groceries and driving which I do every week. What they fail to see bc they’re too good to learn how to do a job better, is that there’s hiccups in the process." (source: kys7nv9)</li></ul>

<h2>Investor Perspective</h2>

<ul><li>"Revenue is up but growth is slow because people have gone back to shopping in person." (source: kysy2ym)</li>
<li>"Instacart charges even more now, pays shoppers less and from reading this sub, shoppers expect the customer to make up the difference with higher tips by begging on chat which is a huge turnoff." (source: kysnaca)</li></ul>

<h2>Original Thread</h2>
<p><h1>Post 1bzu33v:  The reason why instacart is losing customers  by DalaiRamen on 2024-04-09 [+56 votes]</h1>
<p>It’s the new shoppers, or should I say, its the overflow of new shoppers that is the main cause of customers stop using instacart.</p>
<p>I am not saying all new shoppers are bad, or getting more new shoppers is bad. Once upon a time, I was a new shopper, too.</p>
<p>Just imagine, an experienced shopper with the store usually finds 19 items out of 20, and replaces that 1 item with something similar based on past experience.
Whereas, with a lot of newbies, they will find 14-15 items and refund the 5-6 while spending much more time.
So the customer comes home from work and finds that 5-6 ingredients are missing for the dinner recipe, so drives to the store to shop for her/himself only to find out everything is there… if the customer keeps experiencing the same thing over and over, will she/he keep using the service?</p>

<p>As a customer, I can say that I am using Instacart much less than I did before. But it's because of how astronomical grocery prices have become. It used to not be a big deal to pay a little extra for delivery, but now I have to do whatever I can to save - especially with the stores that have higher prices on IC. I might have stopped altogether but right now I have cancer and often can't get to the store. So I am still very grateful that the service and you shoppers are out there.</p>
<h2>Comment kys7nv9 by J_L_jug24 on 2024-04-09 [+24 votes] (in reply to 1bzu33v):</h2>
<p>Main issue I’ve noticed is that they provide the tools to be a good shopper which is inherently easy. However, these tools aren’t required to be reviewed or tested on. Shoppers go into this thinking how hard could it be it’s shopping for groceries and driving which I do every week. What they fail to see bc they’re too good to learn how to do a job better, is that there’s hiccups in the process. Whether it’s the app crashing, unfamiliarity with the store, necessary replacements to multiple out of stocks, long lines, short expiration dates, traffic etc these require customer service that new shoppers may not be familiar or experienced with and in some cases unwilling to learn. So the job then becomes what’s the least I can do to earn the most money. I served in restaurants for a long time so I’m very familiar with this attitude and you see it often on here in the various posts about how awful customers are or this job sucks or whatever. Unfortunately, what these shoppers don’t see is that the bad experience you just provided for the customer doesn’t just affect you, it impacts their willingness to reuse the platform next time or move onto something else which impacts every other shopper. It truly is an easy job that for a lot of customers is necessary. If you can’t learn and adjust quickly then it isn’t for you and you should see yourself out. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think it’s because of the new shoppers even though they do tend to suck I think it’s rather so inflation and how expensive Instacart has always been. It’s not a necessity for people right now people who just made it into middle class are now back considered living paycheck to paycheckand broke</p>

<p>Shopper and a customer. For me, it's new shoppers. Pre 2020, every order was perfect. Now I have a 40% chance if getting what I want. And that's for doordash and IC</p>
<p>.  It has become an absolute crapshoot. And bc of the increased cost, 40% chance of having a good experience does not justify the increased cost. I do amazon/whole foods delivery now bc after trying IC again, the extra hassle just wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>Moldy produce, items not in cold bags when it's 90 degrees, expired items, deliver to wrong apartment door, wrong items, not getting the replacement I asked for in my notes if something is out, missing items that are in the store. I NEVER had these issues before. The service was 100% pre 2020. For me, it's the new shoppers hands down. </p>
<p>And don't get me started on doordash/ubereats. I order a salad 1 MILE away and its brought to me cold, bc dd assigns it a double order. I watch driver multi app and bring me melted ice cream bc of it. Or the "delivery" driver who is only here to delivery, won't grab me a cup of ice water with my delivery. (I ALWAYS UP TIPS post service too, so dude would've definitely been compensated.) Driver, Won't go to my door, bc it's an apartment. And their personal delivery policy, is they do not go inside apartments.  </p>
<p>No, man. This new breed of gig workers seem to only in it for the money. The service has taken a deep dive in the last 3-4 years.  </p>
<p>But my amazon/whole foods orders/deliveries are perfect so thats what I do now. </p>

<p>Doubt it's the shoppers. As someone who used to use instacart often, I stopped because it's way too expensive now. It's not worth it anymore and hasn't been for over a year.</p>
<p>Instacart charges even more now, pays shoppers less and from reading this sub, shoppers expect the customer to make up the difference with higher tips by begging on chat which is a huge turnoff.</p>
<p>It's only going to keep getting worse as instacart tries to make more money.  They can still afford to pay less since some people depend or can't do anything else and will take shitty batches out of desperation.</p>
<h3>Comment kyssm36 by JaeShoppie on 2024-04-09 [+11 votes] (in reply to kysnaca):</h3>
<p>That is the part that really irks me. They should NEVER ask a customer for any type of compensation...EVER. It is disgusting. Its Instacarts fault we make beans, not the customers. They are already paying a markup, fees, and whatever tip they feel they can afford. Shoppers that ask need to be suspended for 24 hours for first offense, a week for 2nd offense and deactivated permanently for the third.</p>
<h3>Comment kythtkt by yetzederixx on 2024-04-09 [+1 votes] (in reply to kysnaca):</h3>
<p>Tips aren't for gratuity, they're bait to get our attention. I avoid instacart orders because they, like Uber Eats, can allow a customer to "tip bait" by decreasing the tip after the fact. I get why, but frankly customers are at least as scummy as drivers.</p>

<p>We almost exclusively use Instacart for groceries and we get a "good shopper" maybe 1 out of every 4 or 5 times. We're in a smallish market, so when I get one who is good (and especially when I recognize their name) I tip 25%-30%. I just want my food.....</p>

<p>Small markets the good shoppers relocate from unfortunately the competition is not for us to sit around and wait for 25 dollar orders when we can go to a larger market and get 50 dollar orders for 5 miles.

<p>I’m new, but I’ve been doing all the grocery shopping for my family for over a decade now.  It’s not rocket science either.   The app even tells you what aisles to look in. </p>
<p>I’ve seen other new shoppers lately and OMG they are clueless.  One lady was starting a shop as I was doing one, I delivered, came back and did another order and she was still there!  Chatting in the aisle with some friend.  Her husband was with her too, I could hear him getting testy with the cashier 🤦.   Two adults can’t finish an order in over 2 hours?!?   Their cart was a mess also.  </p>
<p>I’m not sure if IC could vet  some of these people but I guarantee I wouldn’t have been satisfied if I was that lady’s customer.</p>

<p>They lost me as a customer for a number of reasons, big one was they kept adding more fees. Number two once the pandemic lock downs ended it became a non essential expendature. Number three the value over time wasn't there for me, the amount of time saved ceased to be worth the extra money I was paying for the convenience. Number 4 Walmart+ with in home offers me a better deal without having to feel like I'm being a pinch penny because I can't afford to tip as much as I'd like.</p>
<h2>Comment kyt0uos by Jujulabee on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bzu33v):</h2>
<p>While there is always going to be bad experiences, I think the major reason for fewer customers is the extremely high cost of using Instacart.</p>
<p>I say this as a customer who uses it and plans to continue to use it - I also tip well - at least 20%.</p>
<p>However, the amount that I pay for this luxury is astronomical - I have a $99 annual membership so delivery is free. However, there is a "service fee" which seems to be about 5% and so I pay $13.00 or so additional on a $200 order.</p>
<p>And there is the extreme level of markups which can be 25% or more of the in-store price.</p>
<p>I also pay $3 for Priority because in my experience - since using it for the past year - is that I get consistently get better professional shoppers - i.e. ones who have been working for at least 2 years with 1000 or more shops.</p>
<p>I am lucky enough so that I can afford to use the service and pay probably $100 or more for using it on a moderate weekly shop.</p>
<p>I can't imagine someone who has a tighter budget using it when there are less expensive options. When my finances were different, I made time to do a weekly shop on Sunday because I wouldn't have paid to save an hour or so of time.</p>

<h2>Comment kyszx00 by not_today_1996 on 2024-04-09 [+5 votes] (in reply to 1bzu33v):</h2>
<p>It's the shoppers in general not just new.  Yesterday I got the whole spend $80 get $40 off...okay I'm in, even with fees markup etc I'm coming out way ahead.  I also placed the order with no tip, hoping it would pop and I could grab it myself(for even more win).  Anyway while waiting to see my order, a banger $52 triple with 52 items and 4 miles pops...so my early night where I was hoping to end it with my own shop changes.  As I'm checking out I get a notification that my order was assigned, 4.9 shopper Diamond over 4k batches done.  Okay cool, now I'm gonna need to tip, but even being extremely generous I'm still ahead with the coupon.  I message them telling them I'm a shopper also, let me know if they can't find anything(because I was at the store on the escalator leaving and my order was small item wise, all the protein and staples for the week, I get my produce daily on the last shop of the day).  </p>
<p>Anyway I tell them I'll be tipping them based off the job they do, and I put it as no tip and was hoping to just snag the order myself.  I finish my drop off and check in, I ordered 2 pounds of hanger steak...the app shows 1.02 pounds, ordered 2.5lbs ground sirloin, shows 1.26, so I message him asking if that's all they had, in the hanger steak and asked them to get another package of the ground sirloin(there was 50 packs of the ground sirloin, 30 minutes prior).  They respond saying nothing but it is hanger steak I got it at the counter.....no more communication.  </p>
<p>Delivery arrives, unprofessional, rude hands me the groceries and before I even start unpacking them he's messaging me about the tip, annoyed I tipped $8 (9 item 13 unit order, not even 2 miles from the store).  I then find I'm missing 3 items, and there is two packages wrapped in the butcher paper of the steak, he went back to the counter and got more but didn't update the app(way for me, covered the tip).</p>
<p>If this is even close to a semi normal customer experience, just wow.....you would think knowing its another shopper they would put forth best effort as we all know what it's like</p>

<p>It seems like instacart is doing fine OP: 
https://www.grocerydive.com/news/instacart-reports-strong-q4-highlights-investments-in-customer-incentives/707422/ check it the facts . Of course customer base went down because we are passed the pandemic years so customers have gone back to shopping in person . Plus it’s a luxury to use instacart . Growth is slow and not steady. 
TL;DR Unga bunga ; more people have gone back to shopping in store because it’s expensive to use instacart. OP is just writing a rage piece blaming new shoppers for a decrease in shops but recommend OP to go use doordash and shouldn’t rely on one app for income</p>

<p>I feel like there should just be some kind of try out shop where you get paid to do all the shopping at a couple different places while communicating with the "customer" who is an instacart employee and then you don't check out and return the items to the shelves or something. </p>
<p>After reading some things it's obvious some people shouldn't be shoppers but as a new shopper myself I know that I'm fairly efficient while getting the products needed and not just refunding when something isn't available the way the customer requested. And I take my big Grubhub cooler bag into the store to keep cold items in</p>

The general sentiment is that Instacart is struggling, with many users and workers expressing dissatisfaction with the company's practices and future outlook.

<p>IC is dying a slow death and has been for 2+ years. I hope nobody here is expecting that they can live off IC in the upcoming months. You will only get less and less from here on out. Please don't wait around and expect an upturn. IC will likely be out of business or bought by Uber within 12-18 months. Please - please - go get a real job as soon as you can. </p>
<p>IC is offering you pennies out here and people seem more than happy to sit in parking lots for 12 hours a day to pocket $75 after costs and taxes rather than just bite the bullet and go get a real job that will pay them way more in only 8 hours a day and with benefits and no personal costs. </p>
<p>The hole you're digging yourself hoping that IC will somehow get better is only going to get worse. It was time to bail 18 months ago. Now it's even worse. If you have a line on a real job, grab it.</p>

<p>Yes, this is what a company that is dying does. They make things worse for employees and raise fees on customers. Because they have to.  Do you know that IC used to pay the national rate of reimbursement of 65 cents per mile? I mean, its pretty obvious that you need to pay your employees the price it costs them to drive their car. But IC said, "Nah, how about 30 cents instead?" Every company wants to pay their employees well. But they don't if they can't.</p>
<p>IC couldn't care less if 10 of us do 10 batches per day each or if 100 shoppers do 1 batch a day. It makes no difference to them. Oversaturation is good for them. It guarantees desperation by the shoppers who are waiting and desperate shoppers will grab bad batches that nobody used to ever take. Every day I talk to other shoppers who say "Yeah, I took that 10-mile, $17 job because I had been sitting there for 3 hours and was desperate". This is IC's ideal scenario.</p>

<p>Or they don't pay it because they don't have to? </p>
<p>Like you just said people are happy sitting in parking lots for 12 hours a day for $75. They keep squeezing because people keep accepting it. </p>
<p>Your "because they can't afford to" rule applies to businesses that actually have to make the numbers work. VC and tech companies don't always operate by those logical rules. </p>
<p>Look at their financials. Revenue up 8% but margins down like 80%. Not that it was profitable before lol. So the punishment for performing so terribly? Share price still up like 40% just since February. </p>

<p>This is definitely true and it gets me thinking about whether or not a certain threshold/benchmark should be established by law that would prevent these companies from using independent contractors when they’re not paying them enough to truly be “independent.” As we know, the industry payed fairly in the beginning, but it has now turned into yet another case of all-out corporate welfare where federal, state and local governments are forced to help subsidize its workers in various ways. They’ve even forced government/taxpayers’ hand via customer EBT payments. Man oh man, the system is broken and the gig economy is a perfect example of why. The ability to successfully code a Hungarian algorithm (IC’s engineering foundation) should not mean that it gets rewarded with unlimited indirect tax subsidies.</p>

<p>Im tired of seeing sub $10 and 3 delivery batches. People still pick them up. It’s sad. That’s just blatant exploitation. I ended up signing up for Shipt because I’m right by a target and it’s at least 13 for ~5-10 items and the delivery is always close. It still sucks, but instacart sucks now. Ubereats is horrible too.

<h3>Comment kxl295u by NewLegacySlayer on 2024-04-01 [+22 votes] (in reply to kxkj39h):</h3>
<p>In all honesty, there’s probably just two reasons for people to pick that batch up </p>
<p>The first is people have family and kids so they don’t see that $10 as $10 they see that $10 as food for their family and kids and that $10 is better than nothing especially with how expensive everything is now</p>
<p>The second is drugs. I’ve definitely been addicted before and $10 is everything to someone who’s addicted. That $10 means that at the end of it they’ll get to like get that high and they’re happy to pick that batch up for $10. That’s just how it works</p>

<p>Thanks for being candid about the addiction-related component to the equation. It’s the third time in a week that I’ve seen mention of the subject in these gig subs by individuals who are unfortunate enough to have first-hand experience. These companies have become so monstrous and predatory that they now deliberately exploit and target our friends, family, and neighbors who struggle with addiction in order to please their admin and shareholders. It’s something that hearkens back to the Industrial Revolution era and should be talked about more.</p>

<p>As a person that did IC on and off since 2013, SF Bay Area and years later in the Central Valley… I can say I seen a HUGE influx of both instances you mentioned. When I first started. It was suggested as a supplement income when I was in college. It wasn’t ever a lot of money, but it definitely helped. I stopped for a while; I was working in my field, the pandemic hit, and personal finance issues came up with a spouse loosing income. So we both jumped on IC. Just to get by. During my time before and after I seen both aspects, the family trying to get by and the person seeking drug money. I’m only on IC Reddit because I never left if that makes sense, but I have not opened the app since mid 2022. It’s just as described, low pay, over saturated, time consuming. I can still see to this day people who are very obviously on drugs doing orders. </p>
<p>I’ve shopped at stores for a personal level recently  and have seen and had people shove phones into others faces asking for help. I’ve seen parents shopping with their kids in carts or even helping them get items. I’ve witnessed drivers smoking cigarettes and pot in their cars, I’ve have even been a customer of a person dropping a delivery after passing blunts to passengers and have seen drivers crushing and snoring before and after drop. </p>
<p>I 100% will always support a family trying to get by, but I will never support someone doing this for drugs or while doing them.</p>

Worry less about buying into their bs bait "rewards" and making money to make the carrot happy, and focus instead on making your GOOD customers happy and filtering out the crap batches.

<p>Idk, I’ve been doing IC on and off for 10 years and these waves are always coming and going. The boom and bust is real w/ the gig economy. Although I do think IC being viable is completely dependent on your market and tips, and then to a lesser extent skill levels, and ability to discern well, unfortunately. I consistently make $40-$50 an hour in Los Angeles, but I have strategies, specific areas that I shop, stores that I refuse to go to, etc. Not to say I don’t think IC isn’t a shitty company with an exploitative business model, which it is. But if you’re in the right area and figure out a system, there are worse things you can do to survive capitalism. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>Not only are you fortunate to have prop 22 but Los Angeles is also one of the most profitable markets. You're in a unicorn scenario that doesn't exist outside of your little bubble. There's 49 other states outside of California that don't benefit from front point too California the vast majority outside of Los Angeles and maybe the Bay area is pretty garbage most of the time but prop 22 still saves that. I'm originally from Cali and work there when I'm home visiting family and even my worst days of prop 22 are better than some of my best days working in just about any other states that I've tried and I've tried many. So as they say individual results may vary but posting about 40 to $50 in your little bubble is largely irrelevant to the larger picture and topic at hand 🤷 I know you're not really doing it to brag that's not what I'm getting at but when we're talking about a company that's turning to absolute dog shit in 49 out of 50 states and you come in here and say I'm in the best market in the world and I make XYZ so it's still good like that's not a determining factor in any way.</p>

<p>That’s why I just left my red home state for California. Quadrupled my pay by driving across state lines for a few days. Sometimes that’s the kinda stuff you gotta do. And it works out great because I couldn’t stand where I was from anyway. People know where the money is. It’s up to them to decide if being a little further from mommy and daddy is worth it. For me, it was.</p>
<h4>Comment kxmm5bl by wildglitter on 2024-04-02 [+3 votes] (in reply to kxmcie5):</h4>
<p>I completely agree. But I’d say it has more to do with the market - I think any major city can be like this, as long as you find the right pockets, it’s not just CA. Prop 22, as far as the wage guarantee, honestly doesn’t do much for me. I get a $50-$100 bump a week max. It factors in very little to my hourly average. On the whole though, you’re right, a company this big shouldn’t be exploiting people to the extent they are, it’s insane. I’m also a socialist and I want it all torn down so… 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>I’m with you. I had to stop. My car can’t take much more after 4 years of doing deliveries and I sure tf am not wasting what life it has left for $5 and under batch pay with shitty tips because the customers are being so screwed in fees that they hardly tip anything anymore. I also refused to sign the new contract because I think it’s bullshit that they’re trying to force us to sign away our right to sue them, among other big flaws with it. The new CEO is only concerned about lining <em>her</em> pockets and it’s fucking disgusting that we’re exploited more and more everyday.</p>

<p>Same! I start a W2 job this week. I just can’t live off instacart anymore. I get some people making decent money but not where I live. I just love everything you said bc it’s stuff I say on a weekly basis!</p>

<p>Haha good for you. I just want people to realize that they may have make $40K on IC last year but after every cost, they probably don't keep half of that. A W2 job is so much better and actually provides a peace of mind where you work, and then you have time off. People who are trying to pay bills with IC have no time off. It's phone on all day, every day.</p>

<p>This job stopped being able to support me a year ago when they cut batch payments in half.</p>

<p>Good for you. You can see the big picture. Not just focusing on the fact that IC transferred $544 to your bank account last week. Of course, of that $577, you are actually keeping about $290 and your car is 300 miles closer to breaking down and your tires are 300 miles closer to needing to be replaced.</p>

<p>Yep! My car has been acting up so my bf (who works at Publix so I instacart while he works) let me drive his car. Oil change, transmission fluid service, and 2 tires were $700. Yepppppp I’m officially done after I start my W2 this week!</p>

<p>Most large grocery stores now have their own delivery service post pandemic with sale prices included and just a standard delivery fee or free pickup. No markups on items, and the person shopping is paid an hourly with benefits and you don't ever see that person or feel obligated to tip. I think your correct in your statement.</p>
<h3>Comment kxkrkov by Mako-68 on 2024-04-01 [+11 votes] (in reply to kxkq3xy):</h3>
<p>Yep. This is the eventual demise of IC and they know it. Stores have figured out they can beat IC at their own game VERY easily. The 3 main stores I used to shop at all have this now and they IC orders are cut by half because of it. I know the shoppers at all these stores and they tell me about customers who tip this and tip that and I know many of them from doing their orders 2 or 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Honestly, everyone should go into their local stores and see if you can apply for their shopper jobs. They are MUCH better jobs and the store takes care of y</p></p>

<p><h1>Post 19az1g6:  Grocery Delivery Services INSTACART by 4HisGlory58 on 2024-01-20 [+0 votes]</h1>
<p>I have been using Instacart for about 4 yrs now, and recently started using Shipt. I would normally purchase my groceries once a week. About 85% of the time there is an issue with either with poor quality produce, missed items, receiving items I didn't order, different people who are posted as the shopper but someone else delivering my groceries, charged an extra delivery fee for them taking the groceries out of their car and bringing it to my porch, to days with no shoppers available etc. I tried Shipt which I like better, although they are more expensive but their Customer Service is so much better, because you have the option of requesting the same shopper, but for the last few times, they too do not have any shoppers available, and I've had to cancel my order for the last 4 days. I'm an elderly this is why I have someone else do the shopping for me. Can anyone recommend a different food delivery service that has people who want to work and serve the WESTSIDE....I started out with Walmart and that was a disaster, then Kroger and they don't have anyone from Freddy's so they use Instacart.......I'm tired of poor service and just want a reliable service</p>

<p>You could hire a personal shopper through Task Rabbit. I hired a Instacart shopper who delivered my Instacart orders to be my personal shopper until he went back to college. I hired him directly, didn’t go through Instacart. Then I hire a few shoppers through Task Rabbit. Now I use the favorite shopper feature in Instacart plus or the man I hired through Task Rabbit, whoever is available.</p>

<p>do you pay a fee for their service? if so, how much.......the thing with Instacart you do not get the option of having the same person shop for you, it's whoever is available at the time. Thank you I will look into Task Rabbit</p>
<h4>Comment kionp6d by Animanialmanac on 2024-01-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to kioh6u9):</h4>
<p>Task Rabbit costs a service fee, I believe it’s a percentage of what I pay the shopper. It’s more than the Instacart fees, I believe about 15%. </p>
<p>You can choose a favorite personal shopper in Instacart when you subscribe to Instacart Plus. Once you have a favorite shopper instacart offers them your orders first.</p>

<p>Walmart+ delivery</p>

<p>No thank you they were the first one's I tried and my first delivery came back with someone else's order which consisted of Tuna and Salmon, to which I gave to my dog, they also are limited in what they have as far as variety of items</p>

<p>I'm sorry you're in this situation. It's true that Shipt is better because of the preferred shopper option. I would say keep up with that. It'll take a while to get a few good ones, so be patient. Communicate well with your preferred shoppers, and they will learn what you like and dislike. Tipping well is the key to keeping your preferred shoppers, though. Many of them will go above and beyond for you - increase tips accordingly.</p>
<h3>Comment kiohvus by 4HisGlory58 on 2024-01-20 [+1 votes] (in reply to kiocbjl):</h3>
<p>Yes I do have regular shoppers from Shipt, but the only thing is I have to order on the days they are working, otherwise I'll get whoever is available and according to Shipt, they do not have shoppers at this time, they are low</p>

<p>i’m sorry to hear this :( i’m not too sure what other platforms i can recommend but once you find a good shopper, offer to keep them as your personal shopper maybe? that way there aren’t any fees it’s a transaction between you and that excellent shopper!!! goodluck! 🩷</p>

<p>that’s so pathetic!!!! instacart treats us shoppers like absolutely garbage, it doesn’t surprise me that they also treat customers poorly. at the end of the day all they care about is money. i’m so glad you got some money back!! i’ve come to realize they now also charge customers a ‘long distance fee’ but instacart pockets that… why?? we drive OUR cars with OUR gas using OUR oil and tires! it grinds my gears. the company has completely fallen apart and it’s insanely bad. the value of instacart too has plummeted tremendously. they do it to themselves…</p>

<p>Thank you very much I will suggest this when I can find one that delivers. They are short of shoppers right now in my area. Not sure why I live in a very popular area with 3 Fred Meyers Stores by me</p>

<p>i’m so sorry for the shortage :( ugh my area is flooded with rude or lazy shoppers.. i am an excellent shopper from 2021-current and i see the LOWEST paying batches.. i’m in california too it’s surprising. i would be honored to shop for you :(</p>

<p>Try Dumpling, find a good shopper or two in your area, they really personal shop.</p>

<p>Are you in a smaller area? It could be you are just getting unlucky with bad shoppers. Your best bet is to have a reasonable tip on the order and if you get a shopper that does a really good job give them 5 stars because the app will pair you guys if they are online and in the area. I get repeat customers all the time because they gave me a good rating ☺️</p></p>
