<h2>Original Thread</h2>
<p><h1>Post 1ad7vuv:  What TF Happened To Instacart? by killbillsfatbitch on 2024-01-28 [+66 votes]</h1>
<p>So I used to make $400-$500 a week using Instacart. When considering this was during the peak of the COVID pandemic, that was still pretty good profit. I got another job so dropped Instacart for about a year and a half. Now, I’m back on and the batches SUCK ASS. </p>
<p>2-3 years ago, you’d get offered $70 or over for three orders in one batch. Now, I’m seeing three orders in one batch for like $25-$30. I just saw one batch that was over 30 items with a payout of only $12. What kind of profit is that when you consider all the gas you’re using during delivery?? I live in Wilmington, Delaware - so I get offered batches even in Glen Mills, PA and Philly - so theres an ABUNDANCE of grocery stores. It’s just ridiculous how much Instacart has fallen off. </p>
<p>I’m sure it’s due to people not wanting to tip (and I understand that they don’t have to), the company being cheap, and more competitive delivery services are out now. But damn, Instacart unfortunately isn’t worth it anymore.</p>
<h2>Comment kjzaocv by Comprehensive-Young5 on 2024-01-28 [+33 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>several of my local grocery store started offerin delivery and they have better promotion than instacart and the prices stays the same as in the store</p>
<h3>Comment kk45ybe by Middle-Yam8239 on 2024-01-29 [+15 votes] (in reply to kjzaocv):</h3>
<p>Replying to killbillsfatbitch...
Funny thing is that most of them use Instacart or DoorDash to do the shop. I'm a shopper for IC and the app will literally tell me not to mention Instacart to the customer, because they may be confused as they did not order through Instacart but through a store like Costco or giant. It's like why can't I mention Instacart, just seems kind of odd.</p>
<h4>Comment kk507ie by Personal-One-4572 on 2024-01-29 [+7 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>I find that odd as well because when I order delivery off of the McDonald's app it tells me that it'll be delivered via doordash</p>
<h4>Comment kk46wlw by Top-Obligation-8732 on 2024-01-29 [+3 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>I use stopandshop and they actually have a designated truck specifically for delivering. But for Walmart yea they use DoorDash,Instacart etc</p>
<h4>Comment l2vfqwd by ovalleysuszee on 2024-05-06 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>Exactly! Kroger uses instacart, tells you it does on the app, but guess what? I get to tip the driver but I don't have to kick back at least $10 to Instacart, PLUS I get Kroger in-store prices and get to use their coupons. When my IC+ membership is done later this year, I'm done with it.</p>
<h4>Comment l8oi8kr by NegotiationCertain11 on 2024-06-15 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>Just tell them. It's a crap deal because you could go above and beyond. Ex. Driving 15 mins, No parking for a city apartment and have to carry 14 bags and 2 cases of water across a highway and into a locked access building.. take it up 3 floors and then place it inside for a customer all for $14. 
Then the customer cannot increase your tip or leave you positive comments on IC. I'll no longer pickup  bags at the grocery store. The last straw was a pickup 12 bags, drive 6 miles into the middle of nowhere for $4.76, no tip haha </p>
<h4>Comment kkcfs9m by VinnieTheBerzerker69 on 2024-01-31 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>I explain it to customers when I get a chance.  I just don't do it inside the app</p>
<h4>Comment kod1u7v by sin-sation711 on 2024-02-01 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk45ybe):</h4>
<p>That is odd. I do ubereats and deliver walmart orders often, whenever i need to call i say hi I'm ____, your ubereats driver assigned to deliver your walmart order. Never seen anything tell me not to mention I'm with a different company. I'm still new to instacart so I'm yet to see this on there either.</p>

<p>If it’s not too much to ask, would you care to share the address with the rest of the class so we may help her repaint her house with rotten avocados?</p>
<p>I think I can speak for the entire shopper community when I say that we would all greatly appreciate you and you would go down in shopper history labeled as a hero(ine).</p>
<h3>Comment l2txmcq by None on 2024-05-06 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk0e4fv):</h3>
<p>She is a great CEO for her company. While idiots take $7 batches that take 2 hrs to complete and truly believe that they don't make good money because customers are not tipping well - she brings pretty good profit to her  bosses.</p>

<h3>Comment kk5zct3 by WillLikesCars on 2024-01-29 [+1 votes] (in reply to kjzhigh):</h3>
<p>Hopefully more states/municipalities start doing what Cali and Seattle have done. It’s actually sustainable in Seattle now but it’s only within city limits, so places like shoreline/Bothell/Edmonds or Bellevue/Kirkland/Redmond are just as trash to work in as the rest of the country. Maybe somewhat better since people swarmed to the city for orders, leaving batches easier to grab, but I haven’t bothered. The guaranteed minimum removes the more stressful parts of the job for me.</p>
<h2>Comment kk0am38 by Emergency_Holiday_49 on 2024-01-28 [+10 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>In my area they've completely oversaturated the market with HORRIBLE shoppers!! I live in a really good IC area with customers that have money &amp; love the idea of not having to go to the grocery store, along with tourists that are usually always very generous while they're down here on vacation. But because IC has now prioritized batches to shoppers that accept a lot of orders instead of prioritizing them to the 5-star shoppers like they used to, so many of the good customers have stopped using the service and/or have reduced their default tip from 20% to 10% or less, and will increase with excellent service. Unfortunately, you don't know which they are, so you have to accept low paying orders to find out which ones they are. Personally, I'm not willing to accept low paying orders to find out. I've come across FIVE customers recently that I used to deliver to regularly, when IC prioritized to 5-star shoppers, that used to have a 20% default tip, that now have it set at 10% because of all the terrible shoppers they get now. IC has shot themselves in the foot, and I'm assuming their bottom line, by hiring so many new shoppers that don't know what their doing &amp; most don't seem to care, in order to get the low &amp; no-tip orders picked up. It's a shame because it is a really great service. Unfortunately it's not great anymore, but simply a DD that delivers groceries instead of restaurant food. #bringbackapoorva</p>
<h2>Comment kk0wbxu by Ash_Ebb_1746 on 2024-01-28 [+7 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>It's mostly that customers got tired of crappy service n stopped tipping, too many shoppers, they give priority to new shoppers, and to top of the scammers with the bots</p>
<h3>Comment koh7h1e by Chozly on 2024-02-01 [+1 votes] (in reply to kk0wbxu):</h3>
<p>It's mostly 20 things, but the big one is COVID. People who didn't leave their houses, or minimized it still ate. This happens to all Gig delivery starting immediately after things mellowed out.</p>
<h2>Comment kk4iqmf by nytefyre98 on 2024-01-29 [+5 votes] (in reply to 1ad7vuv):</h2>
<p>And they dropped the amount per batch as well. No longer 7 plus mileage and tip. It's now like $4 plus mileage and tip here.</p>
<h3>Comment kk4jhlq by killbillsfatbitch on 2024-01-29 [+5 votes] (in reply to kk4iqmf):</h3>
<p>Wow! Yeah I was wondering why I was seeing like $5 orders for 12+ items. That’s ridiculous smh</p>

<p>How much is mileage now?</p>

<p>Instacart sucks ass!!! I’m in Philly the batch pay sucks and people barely tip or sometimes even take their tip back after you complete the order! It’s good to make some quick money but sometimes that shit don’t be worth it</p>

<p>Another thing that happened and I don't knock people for have food stamps but the payout went down when instacart started taking food stamps. More low quantity offers low miles but no never nada any tips. I was making 300 a week recently with instacart now I'm lucky if it's 150 and I'm part time. Thank God for multiapping</p>

<p>Prices being higher than in store, plus the fees, plus the fact that Walmart+ has been getting good reviews is driving customers away from IC and shrinking their tips when they do use it. As a customer, it feels like a rip off and the shoppers suffer as a result. And in classic shitty company style - they pit the shoppers against the customers.
Walmart literally incentivizes online shopping with better prices than in store (sometimes). I used to use instacart more often when the stores in my area offered in-store prices. Some of them have changed that, so now I'll go without until I can go in myself.</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s due to people not wanting to tip - You are so, so, so confused.... Please name for me another business who cut down their salaries due to clients not tipping?? Maybe McDonalds? Maybe Macy's? Maye Tesla? Oh, maybe Microsoft or at least 7-eleven? </p>
<p>So, when you list the reasons why Instacart became a shitty place to work for - please don't blame clients and no tipping. Blame the Instacart itself only and only.</p>

<p>What happened to Instacart is they got too expensive and people like me quit using them. I had been using them even before the pandemic, and I didn't mind paying a tip or even a little extra for the groceries. What I do mind is having to pay their new service fee. I have found that I can shop through the Kroger Boost app or on Walmart Plus, pay in-store prices, and not have to pay a service fee at all. Today I was shopping for an Aldi order and IC wanted a $12 service fee, on top of what I was tipping. I switched over to the Kroger app, still paid the same tip for the shopper, saved money because Kroger prices were cheaper, and came out almost $30 less on my total.  </p>
<p>And this is why people aren't using Instacart.</p>

<p>this terable componey has people working 5 hours to end up only making 15 dollars. Worst part is that even thogh they break minimum wage laws they get away with this thievery. I think they bribe congressmen to get away with this un amaricaan behavior. there customers are total trash also nothing but a bunch of invalid obease people to cheep to tip. Because they need that money to feed there obease boys. The goverment pays for it to throgh food stamps. So all amaricans are footing these fat peoples eating habits and they can not even aford to tip.</p>

<p>Every single item he replaced things with were all more expensive, and then he replaced the digestive enzymes which were $3 with something that was $45 and said it’s on sale. And then snapped at me. And then refunded the rest of the items instead of finishing the shopping. Im now worried about what he will be like during delivery. Very nervous.</p>

<p>I’ve had this happen recently with a drive up order from a big box store and a door dash order…it’s maddening.  The big box store order was for 3 medium sized items and the person that brought them out to me gave me a hard time until I pointed out that I have a little baby in the back and it’s flu/rsv season.  The door dasher gave me a hard time for ordering from a restaurant super close to my house but I told them I’m sick and can’t leave so that’s why I tipped so well and it’s a quick order.  I tipped like $10 on an order that was literally like 3 blocks distance.</p>

<p>I've never had it that bad but close. I told one that I was pregnant and that I'm due any day now. They treat you like you're just being lazy for not going to the store yourself. Those are usually the ones who have the nerve to bitch about the pay and want a higher tip. They always say it's the app that's not paying your driver is enough but it's like if you don't want to do the job then don't do the job. Go find a different job. Stop taking it out on the customers because the app is greedy.</p>

<p>I feel so incredibly lucky... I've got celiacs disease so I have to be very careful about brands and flavors. One of my requested items was out of stock tonight so I said a refund would be fine since I've had issues with some of the common replacements. The shopper took the time to find a brand that was both gluten free and didn't have the other grain I'm sensitive to. And she's not the first! I swear, they're more careful about checking labels and finding new foods I can eat than I am!</p>

<p>It’s never happened before. I’ve been using instacart for years on a weekly basis and I normally get the sweetest most helpful shoppers. Only one time have I had a bad shopper but he wasn’t rude to me or anything, just got all wrong items. This is why I have my tip automatically set to 20%, I’m always happy with the service 99.999% of the time. I still am, just a uncomfortable with that interaction. Trying not to let this one bad guy ruin it for instacart for me but this was just off putting.</p>
<h4>Comment kjpms10 by QueenMeg20 on 2024-01-26 [+3 votes] (in reply to kj433o6):</h4>

<p>Not much, if there aren’t tips you don’t make anything. The pay from instacart typically only covers the expense of driving it to you, and they keep lowering it more constantly. It actually used to be a good side gig, but it’s definitely not anymore.</p>

<p>This guy knows that you will be paying what instacart is saying you will pay. He also knows that if the tip is a percentage, he will get more money if you pay more, which is probably why he is subbing larger more expensive items and trying to tell you that they're 'on sale' or some crap. I would report this guy.</p>

<p>Why is this the case? I used instacart once to get a frozen pizza, at the store it was usually $9.99 but at this time I know it was on sale for $7.99, but regardless of any of that they charged me $14.99, and didn't give a receipt or adjust the price later and it's never been $14.99 before.</p>
<h4>Comment kj4pl8k by F1Barbie83 on 2024-01-23 [+60 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>I’m convinced that Instacart and DoorDash have labeled prices more than what it is if you actually went in to the store or restaurant they’re trying to add in a dollar here or a dollar there to make extra money. IMO 🤷🏼‍♀️</p>
<h4>Comment kj2sbzd by mayhem6 on 2024-01-22 [+6 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>I am not entirely sure; people say the stores jack up the prices, and some say instacart jacks up the prices. They probably both do it to a certain extent. I have seen people saying that some stores won't jack up prices on things that are necessities, like bread, eggs, etc but they do so on things like snacks and soda and possibly, pizza. I guess in the end, greed is why, because instacart is also charging service fees and delivery fees and other fees on top of the jacked up price. The stores I guess want a bigger profit on the service as well maybe.</p>

<p>IC charges around 10% or more for every item bought and adds 10% on the end plus delivery fees ect.  Unfortunately, the delivery driver don't get much of that. Drivers make on average $10 per order anda lott of the time that includes tips.  What they charge is on the agreement that everyone signs people just don't read it.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6rlxl by Beginning_Alps_1817 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>The stores set the prices. Not IC. IC charges the stores a %, they can either offer in-store pricing on the app, and eat that cost themselves…or mark up the cost on the app. </p>
<p>The only time the Customer gets the sale prices is if it’s in the app. If it’s not listed as a sale price in the app, it will get rung up at the register as a sale price, but you won’t get charged any differently. IC keeps the difference.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6u30z by PersnicketyParsnip11 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Instacart buys the goods from the store and they can resell them to you at whatever price they want.  Very few stores on Instacart will give you the in-store price on goods.  The pricing policy for each store can be found in-app.</p>
<h4>Comment kj6ukkt by kukumonkey854 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>Yes, but they tell you their prices are different (not defending them, just saying this is known to be the case). If you click on the store name on Instacart then "pricing policy" it will usually say it's different than in person.</p>
<h4>Comment kj72on9 by KasLea82 on 2024-01-23 [+1 votes] (in reply to kj2nwz3):</h4>
<p>The price on Instacart is always higher than in the store. It’s the same thing with DoorDash. If you compare menu item prices say Panera’s app for pickup versus delivery, the price is higher for delivery. And then there’s the delivery fee on top of the higher prices. It’s all a racket. Do your own shopping and get your own food. They’re charging higher prices for the convenience and their cost of operations.</p>

<h3>Comment kj1kk4l by Acrobatic_Event_4163 on 2024-01-22 [+47 votes] (in reply to kj06u8q):</h3>
<p>The tip is whatever the customer chooses though. You can enter it as a percentage, or a flat dollar amount, or you can enter no tip. The shopper is likely screwing himself out of a tip altogether by acting this way.</p>
<h4>Comment kj1u1gz by quantumcalicokitty on 2024-01-22 [+50 votes] (in reply to kj1kk4l):</h4>
<p>Yeah, but you often place a tip before ordering. The drivers see it before accepting the order. If the person placing the order isn't paying attention, or is perhaps susceptible to manipulation (elderly, young adult, disability, etc), then the tip will go up for the driver.</p>
<p>That being said, tips <em>can</em> be adjusted for a time after the delivery is made.</p>
<p>The shopper was trying to make himself more money, that's just the truth. And, I'm sure the scam absolutely works at times.</p>

<p>Tip may not always be a percentage but unless it's changed from when I was a shopper it certainly seemed like the base pay was something plus a percentage.</p>
<p>If I refunded anything the base pay went down and if stuff was more expensive or got added I got paid more.</p>
<p>I would never behave like this guy did though. Even if I had no morals, this is a great way to lose a tip altogether.</p>

<p>The one and only time I used Instacart the guy subbed &amp; charged my card for two $50 bottles of Hennessy for himself, then showed up drunk at my house and delivered me a sack of potatoes (??) and none of the groceries I had ordered. He THEN showed up banging on my door literally two hours later even more drunk and apologized for getting my order wrong then handed me two bags of someone else's groceries??? Never used them again lol like how can the shopper just charge whatever they want to your card without your approval😂😂 I obv disputed and got my money back but like... wtf</p>

<p>Is this entirely true? For example, Publix does buy one get one on products and it doesn’t show up on the app. Savvy customers will add two of things and I’ll see those are all buy one get one items. </p>
<p>But to them, it’s showing as 1 of each regular price. After checkout it shows the BOGO price on the receipt.</p>

<p>Yes it’s true. </p>
<p>Some store offer same as store pricing and some stores have their sales on instacart too. If the customer app honors it, it prompts them to add two.</p>

<p>I agree the shopper is the problem here. They are being really rude and sounds like they shouldn't have picked up the order. Also why would they get a 5lb bag for 2lbs of lemons requested? They didn't have individuals? I would be so angry if this was my shopper. They chose the job. The customer can use the service whenever they want. This gave me the biggest ick from that shopper 🫠</p>

<p>hi! ive never used instacart and am wondering in this scenario as a buyer do they charge you &amp; refund the difference or do they hold the estimated cost of the items until it is paid at the register, at which point they give you back the difference right then?</p>
<h4>Comment kj1fm7b by Swimming_Wheel3391 on 2024-01-22 [+5 votes] (in reply to kj15agp):</h4>
<p>AFAIK They charge the buyer the full price of the item and instacart takes the difference between the price at the register and the full price the buyer pays.</p>
<h3>Comment kj1ioqo by itammya on 2024-01-22 [+3 votes] (in reply to kj043vk):</h3>
<p>That's a catch 22. Instacart adjusts the pricing to reflect their in app prices for some stores. But sorry we that have same pricing the total at the register plus fees is what they get charged</p>

<h2>Comment kj1q985 by Inside_Ninja4264 on 2024-01-22 [+208 votes] (in reply to 19cne6y):</h2>
<p>UPDATE: the app said he finished shopping at 8:28pm and stayed in the “arriving soon” until 8:52pm when I got the notification that my shopper cancelled my order. This guy is a diamond shopper, so I assume he knows the store time orders for the same day delivery, and it felt like he waited as long as he could to prevent me from being able to reorder for same day, which after he cancelled I only had 6 minutes to reorder. I don’t understand how he had so long between finishing shopping and being able to cancel the order, or if the app just took that long to update but either way that was the worst part for me. Luckily I was able to reorder right away, and the next shopper found EVERY SINGLE ITEM. Only one item was weight reduced which was turmeric. Not one item was increased in price like he did. </p>
<p>I don’t know what I did to make him so mad but it made me so uncomfortable waiting for that order to be delivered as I am a female home alone with my 8 week old newborn while my husband is away on a business trip. I don’t understand why it took so long to cancel but I feel like that shouldn’t have been the case. I’m still nervous about this ordeal since he knows my address, and he was so rude out of no where. </p>
<p>I didn’t expect anyone to answer this post to be honest! Thank you for all your responses, I never realized since it’s a percentage for the tip (automatic set at 20% I never change it when checking out) that he is obviously trying to increase that too. I’ve included a screenshot of the $40 increase in the digestive enzymes that he replaced my $3 item with. And he tried telling me they are actually 11.99 which I knew was a lie. </p>
<p>I normally have a wonderful experience with instacart. I order every week using instacart and have been for about 3 years now. Only one other occasion have I had a incident with a shopper which instacart refunded the entire order right away. Despite that I just feel so uncomfortable with this experience, gave me such an uneasy feeling.. I feel I should still report him to instacart but not sure if I can do that since the order was cancelled. Not sure what that would even do or what instacart could do about it since there’s nothing to refund. </p>

<p>You can still report him and I’m pretty sure you can request that he is blacklisted from ever being your shopper again. As a shopper we can blacklist certain customers if they’ve done us dirty in some way. I’m sorry this happened to you. It made me uneasy as well.</p>

<p>I had to have this restriction placed on a shopper. An item was out of stock and they proactively messaged me asking if I was going to “hold it against them” and then got increasingly upset with me. I felt really weird about them dropping groceries at my house and appreciated that Instacart blocked the person. It was just so weird and hostile.</p>

<p>Yea whatever he told you was definitely a lie!! I used to have a personal shopper that used a different app, as well as took instacart orders and would do price comparisons all the time to promote her individual shopping business (I forget the app name but they let the shopper charge what they want for items, delivery fees, etc). Instacart does not offer sales prices unless they are already there on the app, it doesn't matter what the shopper pays, what is says in the app is what the customer pays, instacart pockets the difference. That's how they make their money, they upcharge 10-30% of the regular store price and rarely offer the same sale discounts that are in store.</p>

<p>This can be a double batch for him. He wanted to have it pay through and deliver the other order before canceling yours. Which means he has the chance of keeping the items shopped since “the customer requested the order to be cancelled” he should have and could have dropped the order as soon as you requested it and it would have gone to someone else almost immediately. He chose the most expensive replacements in hopes that the tip was percentage based. Which meant she’d get higher tips. Call IC support and fire a report on him for doing you dirty! And request that he never takes your orders again. I’m not sure if you can rate the cancelled order though</p>
<h3>Comment kj3odai by KenyanBunnie on 2024-01-22 [+2 votes] (in reply to kj1q985):</h3>
<p>You don't have to meet the shopper face to face. Let them leave your groceries, wait till they drive away, and then get your groceries. </p>
<p>Even better, upgrade your doorbell to Nest or Ring.
I have Nest. I will look on my Nest app and see the shopper putting my groceries where I need them, see them snap their picture of the groceries, see them get in their car and leave. Then I go out. </p>
<p>Also good to see how they are handling your stuff when they deliver it. Just in case you find your eggs cracked or bread smooshed up, you know it wasn't you, but them. </p>
<p>And also, have them take pictures of the items that are available. And then in Instacart message area, circle the item you want. So no doubts left for shopper.</p>
<p>I had a shopper keep on telling me a certain product wasn't available, and the replacement she was giving me was ridiculous. So I ask for a picture of what's on the shelves and was able to mark the exact product I wanted as the replacement. Which was very similar to what I originally needed.</p>

<p>I had a shopper one time who was “shopping my order” for about 4 hours. Every once in a while he would text and say he was about to check out but nothing ever happened. I called customer service and they were able to tell (idk how) that he’d never entered the store. They canceled the order but I was really concerned about him having my address. They told me as soon as it’s canceled, he can no longer access. I’m assuming he could have screen shot it (or written it down) if he’d wanted, but it made me feel a little better they had removed that info right away. Still don’t know why he would have accepted my order if he never intended to shop it.</p>

<p>I would report him! Also there's a big chance that the reason he took so long to finally cancel the order is because he probably had another order going at the same time! When I worked CS at a grocery store we'd have instacart shoppers with 2 or 3 separate orders all at once who didn't know what the fuck they were doing. They'd finish one order, pay and then the next one would cause problems and they'd have to call instacart to get things fixed. They'd be on the phone forever while their other order that was done sat and waited to be placed in curbside. This happened all of the time and they sucked. We had some great instacart shoppers but 90% of them were awful and had no business doing it.</p>

<h1>The reason why instacart is losing customers  by DalaiRamen on 2024-04-09</h1>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1bzu33v/the_reason_why_instacart_is_losing_customers/">https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1bzu33v/the_reason_why_instacart_is_losing_customers/</a>

The Reddit thread discusses the reasons behind Instacart's loss of customers, focusing on the impact of new shoppers, rising grocery prices, and overall service quality.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"I’m still very grateful that the service and you shoppers are out there." (source: kyt5tr7)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"I have a 40% chance if getting what I want." (source: kyvv4gz)</li>
<li>"Moldy produce, items not in cold bags when it's 90 degrees, expired items, deliver to wrong apartment door, wrong items, not getting the replacement I asked for in my notes if something is out, missing items that are in the store." (source: kyvv4gz)</li>
<li>"They kept adding more fees." (source: kyticl2)</li></ul>

<h2>Employee Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>



<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"They should NEVER ask a customer for any type of compensation...EVER." (source: kysnaca)</li>
<li>"It's not new shoppers. New shoppers are always there. You were a new shopper at some point. It's the food cost inflation and the fact that most salaries don't keep up with it." (source: kyt220m)</li></ul>

<h2>Investor Perspective</h2>

<ul><li>"Revenue is up but growth is slow because people have gone back to shopping in person." (source: kyyyrl)</li></ul>

<h2>Original Thread</h2>
<p><h1>Post 1bzu33v:  The reason why instacart is losing customers  by DalaiRamen on 2024-04-09 [+52 votes]</h1>
<p>It’s the new shoppers, or should I say, its the overflow of new shoppers that is the main cause of customers stop using instacart.</p>
<p>I am not saying all new shoppers are bad, or getting more new shoppers is bad. Once upon a time, I was a new shopper, too.</p>
<p>Just imagine, an experienced shopper with the store usually finds 19 items out of 20, and replaces that 1 item with something similar based on past experience.
Whereas, with a lot of newbies, they will find 14-15 items and refund the 5-6 while spending much more time.
So the customer comes home from work and finds that 5-6 ingredients are missing for the dinner recipe, so drives to the store to shop for her/himself only to find out everything is there… if the customer keeps experiencing the same thing over and over, will she/he keep using the service?</p>

<p>As a customer, I can say that I am using Instacart much less than I did before. But it's because of how astronomical grocery prices have become. It used to not be a big deal to pay a little extra for delivery, but now I have to do whatever I can to save - especially with the stores that have higher prices on IC. I might have stopped altogether but right now I have cancer and often can't get to the store. So I am still very grateful that the service and you shoppers are out there.</p>

<p>Main issue I’ve noticed is that they provide the tools to be a good shopper which is inherently easy. However, these tools aren’t required to be reviewed or tested on. Shoppers go into this thinking how hard could it be it’s shopping for groceries and driving which I do every week. What they fail to see bc they’re too good to learn how to do a job better, is that there’s hiccups in the process. Whether it’s the app crashing, unfamiliarity with the store, necessary replacements to multiple out of stocks, long lines, short expiration dates, traffic etc these require customer service that new shoppers may not be familiar or experienced with and in some cases unwilling to learn. So the job then becomes what’s the least I can do to earn the most money. I served in restaurants for a long time so I’m very familiar with this attitude and you see it often on here in the various posts about how awful customers are or this job sucks or whatever. Unfortunately, what these shoppers don’t see is that the bad experience you just provided for the customer doesn’t just affect you, it impacts their willingness to reuse the platform next time or move onto something else which impacts every other shopper. It truly is an easy job that for a lot of customers is necessary. If you can’t learn and adjust quickly then it isn’t for you and you should see yourself out. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think it’s because of the new shoppers even though they do tend to suck I think it’s rather so inflation and how expensive Instacart has always been. It’s not a necessity for people right now people who just made it into middle class are now back considered living paycheck to paycheckand broke</p>

<p>Shopper and a customer. For me, it's new shoppers. Pre 2020, every order was perfect. Now I have a 40% chance if getting what I want. And that's for doordash and IC</p>
<p>.  It has become an absolute crapshoot. And bc of the increased cost, 40% chance of having a good experience does not justify the increased cost. I do amazon/whole foods delivery now bc after trying IC again, the extra hassle just wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>Moldy produce, items not in cold bags when it's 90 degrees, expired items, deliver to wrong apartment door, wrong items, not getting the replacement I asked for in my notes if something is out, missing items that are in the store. I NEVER had these issues before. The service was 100% pre 2020. For me, it's the new shoppers hands down. </p>
<p>And don't get me started on doordash/ubereats. I order a salad 1 MILE away and its brought to me cold, bc dd assigns it a double order. I watch driver multi app and bring me melted ice cream bc of it. Or the "delivery" driver who is only here to delivery, won't grab me a cup of ice water with my delivery. (I ALWAYS UP TIPS post service too, so dude would've definitely been compensated.) Driver, Won't go to my door, bc it's an apartment. And their personal delivery policy, is they do not go inside apartments.  </p>
<p>No, man. This new breed of gig workers seem to only in it for the money. The service has taken a deep dive in the last 3-4 years.  </p>
<p>But my amazon/whole foods orders/deliveries are perfect so thats what I do now. </p>

<p>Doubt it's the shoppers. As someone who used to use instacart often, I stopped because it's way too expensive now. It's not worth it anymore and hasn't been for over a year.</p>
<p>Instacart charges even more now, pays shoppers less and from reading this sub, shoppers expect the customer to make up the difference with higher tips by begging on chat which is a huge turnoff.</p>
<p>It's only going to keep getting worse as instacart tries to make more money.  They can still afford to pay less since some people depend or can't do anything else and will take shitty batches out of desperation.</p>

<p>That is the part that really irks me. They should NEVER ask a customer for any type of compensation...EVER. It is disgusting. Its Instacarts fault we make beans, not the customers. They are already paying a markup, fees, and whatever tip they feel they can afford. Shoppers that ask need to be suspended for 24 hours for first offense, a week for 2nd offense and deactivated permanently for the third.</p>

<p>Tips aren't for gratuity, they're bait to get our attention. I avoid instacart orders because they, like Uber Eats, can allow a customer to "tip bait" by decreasing the tip after the fact. I get why, but frankly customers are at least as scummy as drivers.</p>

<p>I’ve seen other new shoppers lately and OMG they are clueless.  One lady was starting a shop as I was doing one, I delivered, came back and did another order and she was still there!  Chatting in the aisle with some friend.  Her husband was with her too, I could hear him getting testy with the cashier 🤦.   Two adults can’t finish an order in over 2 hours?!?

<p>They lost me as a customer for a number of reasons, big one was they kept adding more fees. Number two once the pandemic lock downs ended it became a non essential expendature. Number three the value over time wasn't there for me, the amount of time saved ceased to be worth the extra money I was paying for the convenience. Number 4 Walmart+ with in home offers me a better deal without having to feel like I'm being a pinch penny because I can't afford to tip as much as I'd like.</p>
<h2>Comment kyt0uos by Jujulabee on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bzu33v):</h2>
<p>While there is always going to be bad experiences, I think the major reason for fewer customers is the extremely high cost of using Instacart.</p>
<p>I say this as a customer who uses it and plans to continue to use it - I also tip well - at least 20%.</p>
<p>However, the amount that I pay for this luxury is astronomical - I have a $99 annual membership so delivery is free. However, there is a "service fee" which seems to be about 5% and so I pay $13.00 or so additional on a $200 order.</p>
<p>And there is the extreme level of markups which can be 25% or more of the in-store price.</p>
<p>I also pay $3 for Priority because in my experience - since using it for the past year - is that I get consistently get better professional shoppers - i.e. ones who have been working for at least 2 years with 1000 or more shops.</p>
<p>I am lucky enough so that I can afford to use the service and pay probably $100 or more for using it on a moderate weekly shop.</p>
<p>I can't imagine someone who has a tighter budget using it when there are less expensive options. When my finances were different, I made time to do a weekly shop on Sunday because I wouldn't have paid to save an hour or so of time.</p>

<p>It's the shoppers in general not just new.  Yesterday I got the whole spend $80 get $40 off...okay I'm in, even with fees markup etc I'm coming out way ahead.  I also placed the order with no tip, hoping it would pop and I could grab it myself(for even more win).  Anyway while waiting to see my order, a banger $52 triple with 52 items and 4 miles pops...so my early night where I was hoping to end it with my own shop changes.  As I'm checking out I get a notification that my order was assigned, 4.9 shopper Diamond over 4k batches done.  Okay cool, now I'm gonna need to tip, but even being extremely generous I'm still ahead with the coupon.  I message them telling them I'm a shopper also, let me know if they can't find anything(because I was at the store on the escalator leaving and my order was small item wise, all the protein and staples for the week, I get my produce daily on the last shop of the day).  </p>
<p>Anyway I tell them I'll be tipping them based off the job they do, and I put it as no tip and was hoping to just snag the order myself.  I finish my drop off and check in, I ordered 2 pounds of hanger steak...the app shows 1.02 pounds, ordered 2.5lbs ground sirloin, shows 1.26, so I message him asking if that's all they had, in the hanger steak and asked them to get another package of the ground sirloin(there was 50 packs of the ground sirloin, 30 minutes prior).  They respond saying nothing but it is hanger steak I got it at the counter.....no more communication.  </p>
<p>Delivery arrives, unprofessional, rude hands me the groceries and before I even start unpacking them he's messaging me about the tip, annoyed I tipped $8 (9 item 13 unit order, not even 2 miles from the store).  I then find I'm missing 3 items, and there is two packages wrapped in the butcher paper of the steak, he went back to the counter and got more but didn't update the app(way for me, covered the tip).</p>
<p>If this is even close to a semi normal customer experience, just wow.....you would think knowing its another shopper they would put forth best effort as we all know what it's like</p>

<p>It seems like instacart is doing fine OP: 
https://www.grocerydive.com/news/instacart-reports-strong-q4-highlights-investments-in-customer-incentives/707422/ check it the facts . Of course customer base went down because we are passed the pandemic years so customers have gone back to shopping in person . Plus it’s a luxury to use instacart . Growth is slow and not steady. 
TL;DR Unga bunga ; more people have gone back to shopping in store because it’s expensive to use instacart. OP is just writing a rage piece blaming new shoppers for a decrease in shops but recommend OP to go use doordash and shouldn’t rely on one app for income</p>

<p>I feel like there should just be some kind of try out shop where you get paid to do all the shopping at a couple different places while communicating with the "customer" who is an instacart employee and then you don't check out and return the items to the shelves or something. </p>
<p>After reading some things it's obvious some people shouldn't be shoppers but as a new shopper myself I know that I'm fairly efficient while getting the products needed and not just refunding when something isn't available the way the customer requested. And I take my big Grubhub cooler bag into the store to keep cold items in</p>

The Reddit thread discusses the current state of Instacart, with many users expressing concerns about the company's viability and the declining pay for shoppers. Some users argue that Instacart is dying, while others believe it can still be profitable depending on the market and strategies used.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"I consistently make $40-$50 an hour in Los Angeles, but I have strategies, specific areas that I shop, stores that I refuse to go to, etc." (source: kx3jz7)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"IC is dying a slow death and has been for 2+ years." (source: 1bt8ptl)</li>
<li>"I just can’t live off instacart anymore. I get some people making decent money but not where I live." (source: kxldr33)</li></ul>

<h2>Employee Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<ul><li>"I never want to go back to being told when I can and can’t go on vacation, if I can or cannot go to the bathroom, and be demeaned and worked to death just to pay rent. Instacart for me is salvation from soul crushing wage slavery." (source: kxmhe67)</li></ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"They make things worse for employees and raise fees on customers. Because they have to." (source: kxkih3e)</li>
<li>"I refused to sign the new contract because I think it’s bullshit that they’re trying to force us to sign away our right to sue them, among other big flaws with it." (source: kxkf06e)</li></ul>

<h2>Investor Perspective</h2>

<ul><li>"Revenue up 8% but margins down like 80%. Not that it was profitable before lol. So the punishment for performing so terribly? Share price still up like 40% just since February." (source: kxkj0nn)</li></ul>

<h2>Original Thread</h2>
<p><h1>Post 1bt8ptl:  Instacart is dying, I hope everyone can see that by Mako-68 on 2024-04-01 [+469 votes]</h1>
<p>IC is dying a slow death and has been for 2+ years. I hope nobody here is expecting that they can live off IC in the upcoming months. You will only get less and less from here on out. Please don't wait around and expect an upturn. IC will likely be out of business or bought by Uber within 12-18 months. Please - please - go get a real job as soon as you can. </p>
<p>IC is offering you pennies out here and people seem more than happy to sit in parking lots for 12 hours a day to pocket $75 after costs and taxes rather than just bite the bullet and go get a real job that will pay them way more in only 8 hours a day and with benefits and no personal costs. </p>
<p>The hole you're digging yourself hoping that IC will somehow get better is only going to get worse. It was time to bail 18 months ago. Now it's even worse. If you have a line on a real job, grab it.</p>

<p>Yes, this is what a company that is dying does. They make things worse for employees and raise fees on customers. Because they have to.  Do you know that IC used to pay the national rate of reimbursement of 65 cents per mile? I mean, its pretty obvious that you need to pay your employees the price it costs them to drive their car. But IC said, "Nah, how about 30 cents instead?" Every company wants to pay their employees well. But they don't if they can't.</p>
<p>IC couldn't care less if 10 of us do 10 batches per day each or if 100 shoppers do 1 batch a day. It makes no difference to them. Oversaturation is good for them. It guarantees desperation by the shoppers who are waiting and desperate shoppers will grab bad batches that nobody used to ever take. Every day I talk to other shoppers who say "Yeah, I took that 10-mile, $17 job because I had been sitting there for 3 hours and was desperate". This is IC's ideal scenario.</p>

<p>Or they don't pay it because they don't have to? </p>
<p>Like you just said people are happy sitting in parking lots for 12 hours a day for $75. They keep squeezing because people keep accepting it. </p>
<p>Your "because they can't afford to" rule applies to businesses that actually have to make the numbers work. VC and tech companies don't always operate by those logical rules. </p>
<p>Look at their financials. Revenue up 8% but margins down like 80%. Not that it was profitable before lol. So the punishment for performing so terribly? Share price still up like 40% just since February. </p>

<p>This is definitely true and it gets me thinking about whether or not a certain threshold/benchmark should be established by law that would prevent these companies from using independent contractors when they’re not paying them enough to truly be “independent.” As we know, the industry payed fairly in the beginning, but it has now turned into yet another case of all-out corporate welfare where federal, state and local governments are forced to help subsidize its workers in various ways. They’ve even forced government/taxpayers’ hand via customer EBT payments. Man oh man, the system is broken and the gig economy is a perfect example of why. The ability to successfully code a Hungarian algorithm (IC’s engineering foundation) should not mean that it gets rewarded with unlimited indirect tax subsidies.</p>

<p>Im tired of seeing sub $10 and 3 delivery batches. People still pick them up. It’s sad. That’s just blatant exploitation. I ended up signing up for Shipt because I’m right by a target and it’s at least 13 for ~5-10 items and the delivery is always close. It still sucks, but instacart sucks now. Ubereats is horrible too.

<h3>Comment kxl295u by NewLegacySlayer on 2024-04-01 [+22 votes] (in reply to kxkj39h):</h3>
<p>In all honesty, there’s probably just two reasons for people to pick that batch up </p>
<p>The first is people have family and kids so they don’t see that $10 as $10 they see that $10 as food for their family and kids and that $10 is better than nothing especially with how expensive everything is now</p>
<p>The second is drugs. I’ve definitely been addicted before and $10 is everything to someone who’s addicted. That $10 means that at the end of it they’ll get to like get that high and they’re happy to pick that batch up for $10. That’s just how it works</p>

<p>Thanks for being candid about the addiction-related component to the equation. It’s the third time in a week that I’ve seen mention of the subject in these gig subs by individuals who are unfortunate enough to have first-hand experience. These companies have become so monstrous and predatory that they now deliberately exploit and target our friends, family, and neighbors who struggle with addiction in order to please their admin and shareholders. It’s something that hearkens back to the Industrial Revolution era and should be talked about more.</p>

<p>As a person that did IC on and off since 2013, SF Bay Area and years later in the Central Valley… I can say I seen a HUGE influx of both instances you mentioned. When I first started. It was suggested as a supplement income when I was in college. It wasn’t ever a lot of money, but it definitely helped. I stopped for a while; I was working in my field, the pandemic hit, and personal finance issues came up with a spouse loosing income. So we both jumped on IC. Just to get by. During my time before and after I seen both aspects, the family trying to get by and the person seeking drug money. I’m only on IC Reddit because I never left if that makes sense, but I have not opened the app since mid 2022. It’s just as described, low pay, over saturated, time consuming. I can still see to this day people who are very obviously on drugs doing orders. </p>
<p>I’ve shopped at stores for a personal level recently  and have seen and had people shove phones into others faces asking for help. I’ve seen parents shopping with their kids in carts or even helping them get items. I’ve witnessed drivers smoking cigarettes and pot in their cars, I’ve have even been a customer of a person dropping a delivery after passing blunts to passengers and have seen drivers crushing and snoring before and after drop. </p>
<p>I 100% will always support a family trying to get by, but I will never support someone doing this for drugs or while doing them.</p>

Worry less about buying into their bs bait "rewards" and making money to make the carrot happy, and focus instead on making your GOOD customers happy and filtering out the crap batches.

<p>Idk, I’ve been doing IC on and off for 10 years and these waves are always coming and going. The boom and bust is real w/ the gig economy. Although I do think IC being viable is completely dependent on your market and tips, and then to a lesser extent skill levels, and ability to discern well, unfortunately. I consistently make $40-$50 an hour in Los Angeles, but I have strategies, specific areas that I shop, stores that I refuse to go to, etc. Not to say I don’t think IC isn’t a shitty company with an exploitative business model, which it is. But if you’re in the right area and figure out a system, there are worse things you can do to survive capitalism. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<h3>Comment kxmcie5 by Fluffy-Commercial492 on 2024-04-01 [+7 votes] (in reply to kxl3jz7):</h3>
<p>Not only are you fortunate to have prop 22 but Los Angeles is also one of the most profitable markets. You're in a unicorn scenario that doesn't exist outside of your little bubble. There's 49 other states outside of California that don't benefit from front point too California the vast majority outside of Los Angeles and maybe the Bay area is pretty garbage most of the time but prop 22 still saves that. I'm originally from Cali and work there when I'm home visiting family and even my worst days of prop 22 are better than some of my best days working in just about any other states that I've tried and I've tried many. So as they say individual results may vary but posting about 40 to $50 in your little bubble is largely irrelevant to the larger picture and topic at hand 🤷 I know you're not really doing it to brag that's not what I'm getting at but when we're talking about a company that's turning to absolute dog shit in 49 out of 50 states and you come in here and say I'm in the best market in the world and I make XYZ so it's still good like that's not a determining factor in any way.</p>

<p>That’s why I just left my red home state for California. Quadrupled my pay by driving across state lines for a few days. Sometimes that’s the kinda stuff you gotta do.

<h4>Comment kxmm5bl by wildglitter on 2024-04-02 [+3 votes] (in reply to kxmcie5):</h4>
<p>I completely agree. But I’d say it has more to do with the market - I think any major city can be like this, as long as you find the right pockets, it’s not just CA. Prop 22, as far as the wage guarantee, honestly doesn’t do much for me. I get a $50-$100 bump a week max. It factors in very little to my hourly average. On the whole though, you’re right, a company this big shouldn’t be exploiting people to the extent they are, it’s insane. I’m also a socialist and I want it all torn down so… 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>Most large grocery stores now have their own delivery service post pandemic with sale prices included and just a standard delivery fee or free pickup. No markups on items, and the person shopping is paid an hourly with benefits and you don't ever see that person or feel obligated to tip. I think your correct in your statement.</p>
<h3>Comment kxkrkov by Mako-68 on 2024-04-01 [+10 votes] (in reply to kxkq3xy):</h3>
<p>Yep. This is the eventual demise of IC and they know it. Stores have figured out they can beat IC at their own game VERY easily. The 3 main stores I used to shop at all have this now and they IC orders are cut by half because of it. I know the shoppers at all these stores and they tell me about customers who tip this and tip that and I know many of them from doing their orders 2 or 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Honestly, everyone should go into their local stores and see if you can apply for their shopper jobs. They are MUCH better jobs and the store takes care of you. They also love to hire former IC-ers because you already know how to do the job.</p>
<p>Just try to become less obsessed with all the posts you see on here about at $70 tip or a $90 tip and live in reality and realize that you aren't those and the rush of getting a couple of those a month isn't better than a steady job with benefits.</p>

<p>Companies like Walmart and Amazon are already on to this, and they can write off a massive chunk of change doing it. Kroger is working on it. Expect to see more stores following suit. It's better for their image if it's "their people" doing it, and they also rake in the money if a subscription is needed for people to get it.</p>

<p>In my non-biased opinion, IC is far from dying. In fact, IC is going to make other stores and department chains rethink how they do business. When a good portion of their $ comes from Instacart orders, I really don’t see IC dying. Maybe IC can do a better job filtering people and not just letting everyone sign up to do it. </p>
<p>All markets are different also. Customers not tipping is what kills me more than IC. Go to any other job and there are highs and lows. </p>

<p>I’ve been on all sides of this gig; during Covid I did it full time for two years because my industry was shutdown as all hell. Then I got back to working my main job and did IC on the side for bonus cash and it was much better served as a side gig. Then in July this past year when they announced the batch pay drop is the last time I took an order, simply because I value my time a lot more than what they determined shopping a batch is worth, and I just don’t shop anymore</p>
<p>I will say, having been a shopper previously and now on the outside, the shoppers in this sub are desperate to pull the wool over their own eyes and try and justify that IC is still good, and “slow days/weeks” are “due to <strong><em>_</em>, and will pick back up when </strong>___ happens”. Except it never does, it just keeps getting worse. And then those shoppers keep taking shittier and shittier orders and justifying that to themselves that it’s still worth it, and that’s exactly what IC wants out of its shoppers. For crap to become the norm so you don’t question it. It never ends up getting better, and I don’t know why so many people want to cling to IC like a life raft instead of getting out and finding somewhere to work worth your time</p>

<p>I hope that Instacart can see these shoppers in Costco with three phones for one person. Makes it hard for us others with only one phone</p>

<p>They genuinely don't care. And there is no way to report these shoppers and that is by IC's design. They don't care and they don't want us wasting their time with it. As long as the jobs get delivered, they don't care who does it.</p>

<p>True story. Essentially, inundating the market with numerous shoppers is the sole method to continue completing low-paying batches. This is also how Instacart conditions some of its shoppers to accept lower pay every quarter of the year since its initial public offering.</p>
<h3>Comment kxmnnuh by Mako-68 on 2024-04-02 [+2 votes] (in reply to kxmhgac):</h3>
<p>Yes. This is how companies operate. If anyone thinks that IC doesn't have a direct strategy that involves conditioning their employees to accept lesser and lesser pay out of desperation, they don't understand how they try to increase profits without raising prices for customers.</p>

<p>Yep. I see it. I'm just in denial. It started off SO GOOD for both shoppers and customers. And then after the first couple of years, just gradually went downhill until these last few years, when it was given a violent shove into hell. </p>
<p>It sucks and I do not like it.  😞</p>

<p>lol “real job”. Pretty sure driving, risking my life on the road, shopping, replacing things, adapting to random scenarios, customer service is all part of a real job.. last time I had a “real job” I got tasks that weren’t in the job description, crap hours, late pay days, etc… I think I’ll pass on whatever you think a “real job” is. If it gets bought up, oh well, back to Domino’s or something. Pretty quick getting hired on with them.</p>

<p>Instacart is not dying and I’m sorry if you have been struggling in your area, there are numerous ways to make decent money on Instacart but it all depends on what strategy you use. You have to be willing to change your strategy, the stores you shop at because the market fluctuates with new shoppers or slow periods. </p>
<p>This is part of the normal cycle and when you have been doing Instacart for over 7 years, you start to see the patterns. The best times to shop, the best stores to shop ( until they become over saturated), and when batches seem to be more numerous. For example, there are usually a lot more batches that pop up after 3pm because of kids getting home and parents wanting to order stuff for dinner and etc.</p>
<p>I don’t have time to explain all the strategies I use but I can tell you, I have made more money every single year while doing Instacart while also reducing my hours slightly. I usually try not to work weekends but I’ll still work a weekend here and there for extra money.</p>
<p>I’m still making $1100-1400  on average and my best weeks being closer to $1600-1900. My average hours for a typical $1100-$1400 week is roughly 22-27 hours  and closer to 30-40 hours for the higher amounts.</p>
<p>As a veteran with over 12000 orders completed, I can tell you that strategy plays a huge role in your income. I also realize every market is different and I have worked in Washington, Oregon, New York and California, and I have always made amazing money in those states. I have also traveled the country while on vacation and I have experienced what other states see.</p>
<p>However, if you can refine your strategy to take advantage of every single thing, you can make your earnings go even further.</p>
<p>For example, a big topic in this discussion was car maintenance, wear and tear and etc. I started off with a mustang which I drove for 3-4 years and the gas on that car killed my earnings. It was also a nightmare for car repairs as it broke down often. I eventually upgraded to a brand new sonata hybrid which has a 100k warranty, it gets 51 miles per gallon and I was able to write the car off for tax purposes.</p>
<p>I went from spending $700-800 a month in gas ( filling up 3-4 times a week in the mustang ), to filling up once a week in my hybrid. I cut my gas bill down to roughly $200 a month and saved the extra money I wasn’t spending on gas.</p>
<p>I also take advantage of the diamond level for cheaper maintenance costs and I also don’t have to worry about expensive repairs because of the 100k warranty. I will sell my car once it hits 100k miles and I will buy another car. Also, hybrids retain their resale value pretty well. They don’t depreciate as much as other cars which helps when it’s time to sell the car.</p>
<p>Using this strategy, I went from having to pay 4-7k in car repairs in my mustang to not having to pay any car repairs due to the warranty coverage. I was able to save roughly $6000 in gas and now my yearly gas total is $2400 compared to $8400.</p>
<p>Also, the tax break for writing the car off was huge, I usually owe 5-7k in taxes each year ( making roughly 60-80k ) and I was able to not owe anything for the year I bought the car in. There are a lot of other deductions you can use to lower your overall tax bill, meals, insurance, phone bill, loan, phone, phone accessories, car washes, mileage and car expenses and repairs if you are doing total expenses.</p>
<p>I started off with very little money and I have been able to turn my life around, I have a car, a house and I’m able to take vacations and I have been able to save and invest money. There are ways to make a great living while doing Instacart full time.</p>
<p>I know not everything is perfect with Instacart, with the lower pay, the triple batches, the long distances we have to drive and with them changing their policies on us whenever they want. Even with all the shit we put up with, there are still ways to make an amazing living doing this job. </p>
<p>If you take the time to learn everything there is to learn from this gig work, you can make a lot of money and maximize your earnings so that you aren’t losing a lot of your earnings on certain expenses and etc. Use the strategies to play around with your market to see what strategies work best. Also, write down the peak times of your market, what stores are busy and when they are busiest. Keep an eye out for patterns because you will start to see patterns the longer you do this job.</p>
<p>And lastly, be flexible in what you will take as a bare minimum because being flexible in the batches you will accept will help you in the long run. If you are really stubborn ( like I was at first ) and are waiting at the same store while wasting hours in the parking lot in the hopes of getting a huge order, then you have already hurt yourself. It’s far more productive to go to another store or to do batches that don’t pay as well in order to make money.</p>
<p>If you are waiting for a $50 order but a $25 order comes up for 20 items and 3-6 miles, take the smaller order because those add up and it’s better to do those then wait hours for a $50 plus order. </p>
<p>One more thing, the new shoppers will eventually burn out, I rarely see new shoppers who go on to doing Instacart for years and years. Once their honeymoon priority batches is over, they tend to burn out and are gone within 6 months. It’s a cycle I have seen over the last 7 years, there are periods where there are a lot of new shoppers before holidays and summer and then they fade away with time. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long post guys but I wanted to share my experience.</p>
<h3>Comment kxpsfbf by Mako-68 on 2024-04-02 [+2 votes] (in reply to kxpah0q):</h3>
<p>I agree with almost all of this. IC isn't handing out cash. You gotta do the job intelligently and correctly. I have seen hundreds of lameasses come and go. There are 4 of us still here who have been here for years. That's all. Out of thousands. IC is the ultimate survival of the fittest. If you're dumb, you'll get weeded out eventually.</p>
<p>I have made almost $250K on IC. I know every nuance and every little strategy of my area. I live where I shop. Commuting 30 miles roundtrip is death for this job. I have a full Excel spreadsheet with every possible stat. The first thing I would tell everyone is know exaclty how much you make per mile driven. It is the most important stat for IC success. You count every mile from when you leave home to when you get home. Then take your income, divide it by miles, and then you can see if you are successful or not. Last year I was at $4.85 per mile. I make $4.85 for every mile I drive when I leave my house to when I get home. Figure yours out. My own opinion is that you need to be over $2.35 per mile for IC to be viable, but that could vary a little based on your area.</p>
<p>I know people still make money with IC. Of course they do. But the fact is that the arrow is pointing down and IC will shut it all down in a millisecond with zero regard for all of us if it benefits their bottom line even a tiny bit. I just want people to understand what fraction of their earnings they are actually keeping and to get out now if there is another opportunity. Using your own resources is not a viable long-term plan. Get a job where they add to your benefits, not one where you need to use your own resources to add to the corporation's profits.</p>

<p><h1>Post 19az1g6:  Grocery Delivery Services INSTACART by 4HisGlory58 on 2024-01-20 [+0 votes]</h1>
<p>I have been using Instacart for about 4 yrs now, and recently started using Shipt. I would normally purchase my groceries once a week. About 85% of the time there is an issue with either with poor quality produce, missed items, receiving items I didn't order, different people who are posted as the shopper but someone else delivering my groceries, charged an extra delivery fee for them taking the groceries out of their car and bringing it to my porch, to days with no shoppers available etc. I tried Shipt which I like better, although they are more expensive but their Customer Service is so much better, because you have the option of requesting the same shopper, but for the last few times, they too do not have any shoppers available, and I've had to cancel my order for the last 4 days. I'm an elderly this is why I have someone else do the shopping for me. Can anyone recommend a different food delivery service that has people who want to work and serve the WESTSIDE....I started out with Walmart and that was a disaster, then Kroger and they don't have anyone from Freddy's so they use Instacart.......I'm tired of poor service and just want a reliable service</p>
<h2>Comment kiocxcr by Animanialmanac on 2024-01-20 [+6 votes] (in reply to 19az1g6):</h2>
<p>You could hire a personal shopper through Task Rabbit. I hired a Instacart shopper who delivered my Instacart orders to be my personal shopper until he went back to college. I hired him directly, didn’t go through Instacart. Then I hire a few shoppers through Task Rabbit. Now I use the favorite shopper feature in Instacart plus or the man I hired through Task Rabbit, whoever is available.</p>
<h3>Comment kioh6u9 by 4HisGlory58 on 2024-01-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to kiocxcr):</h3>
<p>do you pay a fee for their service? if so, how much.......the thing with Instacart you do not get the option of having the same person shop for you, it's whoever is available at the time. Thank you I will look into Task Rabbit</p>
<h4>Comment kionp6d by Animanialmanac on 2024-01-20 [+3 votes] (in reply to kioh6u9):</h4>
<p>Task Rabbit costs a service fee, I believe it’s a percentage of what I pay the shopper. It’s more than the Instacart fees, I believe about 15%. </p>
<p>You can choose a favorite personal shopper in Instacart when you subscribe to Instacart Plus. Once you have a favorite shopper instacart offers them your orders first.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you're in this situation. It's true that Shipt is better because of the preferred shopper option. I would say keep up with that. It'll take a while to get a few good ones, so be patient. Communicate well with your preferred shoppers, and they will learn what you like and dislike. Tipping well is the key to keeping your preferred shoppers, though. Many of them will go above and beyond for you - increase tips accordingly.</p>

<p>i’m sorry to hear this :( i’m not too sure what other platforms i can recommend but once you find a good shopper, offer to keep them as your personal shopper maybe? that way there aren’t any fees it’s a transaction between you and that excellent shopper!!! goodluck! 🩷</p>

<p>that’s so pathetic!!!! instacart treats us shoppers like absolutely garbage, it doesn’t surprise me that they also treat customers poorly. at the end of the day all they care about is money. i’m so glad you got some money back!! i’ve come to realize they now also charge customers a ‘long distance fee’ but instacart pockets that… why?? we drive OUR cars with OUR gas using OUR oil and tires! it grinds my gears. the company has completely fallen apart and it’s insanely bad. the value of instacart too has plummeted tremendously. they do it to themselves…</p>

<p>Are you in a smaller area? It could be you are just getting unlucky with bad shoppers. Your best bet is to have a reasonable tip on the order and if you get a shopper that does a really good job give them 5 stars because the app will pair you guys if they are online and in the area. I get repeat customers all the time because they gave me a good rating ☺️</p></p>
