<h2>Comment kyn4d7g by generalmasandra on 2024-04-08 [+33 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):</h2>
<p>I got hopeful when I read former Riot, a non pvp/combat-ish mmo years ago.</p>
<p>But the question needs to be asked - why play this over a survival base builder or a city builder or a Sim City type game? They all provide a more unique and detailed experience in their respective areas.</p>
<p>From what I remember in testing - you're basically handed a plot of land at the beginning after some quests and you can start building/questing to progress. But these plots of land were away from the main village tucked away and I thought it was an instanced zone you could see with others so they could recycle the same handful of plots.</p>
<p>And at that point why not play Valheim or V Rising or Palworld or something where you can build anywhere, see roughly the same number of real players or none at all if you prefer solo.</p>
<p>Palia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city.</p>
<p>And I think Palia is kind of falling into that pitfall of assuming players will group up and make content on their own for pve. A tiny minority will. Pvp games the competition is the content. But pve you need to find a way to get people to work towards a common goal.</p>
<p>Anyways just my rambling thoughts as someone who was optimistic, tried it out and got turned off. Sucks people are getting fired. Wish them well.</p>
<h3>Comment kyns6av by No_Dig903 on 2024-04-08 [+24 votes] (in reply to kyn4d7g):</h3>
<p>Mate, former *big company* generally means they're slaves to gridlock, whether or not they know it.</p>
<p>What you want is some scrappy bastard from a small MMO studio that had to wear a lot of hats. It's why you see old LOTRO company devs doing shit like leading Stellaris development.</p>
<h4>Comment l72qa3f by Nik_wilks on 2024-06-04 [+1 votes] (in reply to kyns6av):</h4>
<p>yea not true. These are people not robots. its just previous experience. Small has nothing to do with it. its who your stakeholders and publishers are. small or big, they can be as you put it gridlock. for god sakes we just saw CONCORD. small developer with a big publisher making another overwatch copy instead of a innovative game. Your brain dead comments is how i know your were never in the game industry. Just more speculation by a loser who wants everyone to think they are an expert. please take your trash comments elsewhere. We dont put you into a category just because you work at Mcdonalds or Walmart do we? is that not a gridlock as well? working 9 -5 for scaps? yea, that's what i thought.</p>
<h3>Comment kyppu7o by NoWordCount on 2024-04-09 [+9 votes] (in reply to kyn4d7g):</h3>
<p>Honestly? I enjoy the characters and setting.</p>
<p>Please don't downvote me for liking it. 😥</p>
<p>I have ADHD. I struggle with a lot of crafting and survival game because I can never remember the resources I need, and I always feel like I'm falling behind. I'm into a lot of high-execution games... but open world survival games generally just leave me feeling mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>The limited resources and the generally simple routes to obtain them is something that my broken brain can handle without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Many of the criticisms against Palia made hard are entirely valid. But I find the depth of the characters and the story they're involved in honestly really well written and compelling to engage with. Enough so that it keeps me wanting to come back regularly to learn more about them, despite the basic gameplay loop.</p>
<h4>Comment kypy0pe by SvenWollinger on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to kyppu7o):</h4>
<p>The story and characters are great, if you like those kind of stories.
For me (both queer and neurodivergent) it was heaven. I remember the announcement trailer and praying itll come out one day.
I did have a great time for about 4 weeks, since repetitive tasks dont quite stop me from having fun.
What ultimately killed my vibe was when the bug happend to me that randomizes your characters appearance and voice (back then you couldnt change voice).
Ive known people who didnt want to play their characters anymore for dysphoria, and i also lost interest because my character sounded too silly lol.
Its a game all about looks. How the npcs look, your character, your house..
How they took multiple months to add a damn voice setting is beyond me.
And thats my issues, it is so obvious that the devs were not cut out for this.</p>
<p>The story and art are fine and great for the right kind of player.
But the technical side of the game is an absolute mess.
Sadly :(</p>
<h2>Comment kyn2w40 by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-08 [+106 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):</h2>
<p>Played it back when it was EA... for one day. I like cozy games, i don't need always high stakes... but the gameplay loop was so insanely boring, only two zones and max. 24 other Players with you on one map. The Story was generic and kinda uninspired. The Crafting was boring... and also the whole game was not what they advertised.</p>
<p>The Server Structure back then was bad too. Don't know if they fixed it. I can't describe it better than, if you switched to the second zone or your home, you basically logged out one server and logged in on another server. Basically never meeting the same people again.</p>
<p>Edit: Basically i'm amazed they made it that far.</p>
<h3>Comment kyn3rho by Hexdro on 2024-04-08 [+17 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>Tbh not entirely sure if they've really made it anywhere considering they've axed a third of their development team and the game is still in open beta/early access haha.</p>
<h4>Comment kyn4vn3 by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-08 [+1 votes] (in reply to kyn3rho):</h4>
<p>Yeah... well, you're right. Back then i said, i would be surprised if we're talking about Palia in 2024. So, yeah i'm a bit surprised that this happens now and not last year.</p>
<h3>Comment kyn38r2 by Slow_to_notice on 2024-04-08 [+13 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>Yeah it really dampened the idea of meeting people when as you said you were constantly swapping between rooms.</p>
<h3>Comment kynpxxg by tsukaimeLoL on 2024-04-08 [+11 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: Basically i'm amazed they made it that far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its just still a bit disappointing to me that this took 6 years to make by some developers I thought really had potential</p>
<h3>Comment kyxpc4q by Specialist_Flamingo5 on 2024-04-10 [+4 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>I agree 100 percent i played in Beta and I was hoping for new zones added or at least new questing hubs, there are tons of areas just wasting space and for cozy game enthusiast the crafting just isn't there. No paths for your lot, your house is very limited in what you can place in it. I had such high hopes and just no advancement in the past year.</p>
<h4>Comment kyzd67q by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-10 [+2 votes] (in reply to kyxpc4q):</h4>
<p>Yeah, this game is just lots of wasted potential.</p>
<h3>Comment kyqp909 by Zarod89 on 2024-04-09 [+6 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>They took out all the interesting stuff out of an mmo and you are left with Palia. When pruning goes too far</p>
<p>If people just want to sit around a campfire and talk to eachother, they can play any other mmo with an actual large world and more RP/cosmetic options. Palia is more like a small lobby with limited options.</p>
<h3>Comment kyolz74 by -D-S-T- on 2024-04-08 [+4 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>Yeah the gameplay loop was so boring, i left.</p>
<h3>Comment kypbs07 by Lraund on 2024-04-09 [+4 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):</h3>
<p>You need other players to cut some trees and hate other players for existing for mining nodes. Doesn't take to much to advance pretty far where you don't have much to do except farm money to customize your house cosmetically.</p>
<p>Unless stuff has changed since or I missed something when I played it.</p>

<p>Palia isn't quite an "MMO" but it's still news. The developers have axed around 35% of its staff (49 people or so) which includes people from all areas of the team - from narrative writing to character design, environment artist and engineers. This news along with the mixed reception from the Steam launch, keeping the fact that the game is in 'beta', etc - the future of the game is worrying tbh.</p>

<p>Anyone whose into these types of games, don't bother. I played for about a month or two when it went to open beta</p>
<p>The studio doesn't seem to know what it's doing or they're just trying to go after whales. They made it clear that you will <em>never</em> be able to unlock new outfits with out paying real life money for it despite having a clothing shop in game...which just brought you to the cash shop...</p>
<p>When I played the game only had two tiny maps you could run around. The gameplay loop of the game gets old really fast.</p>
<p>There's no trading between players other than a goofy gifting system where you can give people stuff exchange for 1 point of something you need 100 of to do anything with, which you can get more of talking to the NPC's.</p>
<p>The game should have been $20, single player, with a focus on the story since that's exactly how it plays. You talk to the NPCs and can romance some of them or all of them and do their personal story as well as a main quest/storyline. There's literally no reason for this game to be online only other than the fact that they want to sell you $30 outfits with extremely limited colors.</p>
<p>And as for the time i was playing the only way to get a pet was to spend a bunch of money in the cash shop.</p>
<p>The people who made the story and characters are talented. But whoever is running the show over does not know what they're doing. It's like they looked at what mobile games do and thought it would translate to PC or something.</p>

<p>Reminds me of Wagadu Chronicles and all the other more... out of the box "mmos" that have come out over the past couple years. Someone, somewhere, had a unique idea, story, setting and said "lets sell this to people and let them play it" but they were too busy coloring outside of the lines (which can be genius) to actually <em>make a fucking game anyone wanted to play</em>.</p>
<p>They were more intent on originality and creativity than actual gameplay design. Which is a shame, because to really <em>change the narrative</em> you need both. Want to make a cozy non-violent life sim mmorpg redefine the genre? Make it fun, engaging and worthwhile. Make a good game.</p>

<p>I was interested in this game for quite a while as was one of my friends. We were so disappointed in how small scale the multiplayer is. Makes me sad. The game did remind me of FreeRealms a bit and I was hoping for that. Instead we got a 24 player shared instance that hardly rewards and instead punishes multiplayer. It's laughable how pointless it is. I do not know what they were thinking.</p>

<p>This. So many fans love to boast that Palia is not pay to win. The problem with that statement is there is no way for another player to gain a mechanical advantage over another, so the typical “pay to win” scenario doesn’t exist in the first place. The only advantage that exists is a social-advantage.</p>
<p>Want to look cool like that player? That’ll cost $30.</p>

<p>There is nothing "micro" about their cash shop. </p>
<p>Like others pointed out the outfits they were trying to sell weren't all that appealing to begin with and that's ignoring the lack of dye customization.  There were one or two that I <em>might</em> have caved at us$1 but for 15+?  hard. no.</p>

<p>After watching multiple gameplay streams I am not surprised. It does <strong>nothing</strong> new or unique in terms of gameplay. All it has is a somewhat unique art style, and even that will absolutely repulse many potential players who prefer to have player characters with more details and more "not just a plain, generic human" race options.</p>

<p>The game felt incredibly cheap in my opinion. Movement and jumping etc were just so 2007 gaming. The gameplay loop gets tedious fast and there aren’t any varying zones to visit. It needed much more time to cook</p>
<h2>Comment kypy7zu by Jogipog on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):</h2>
<p>Palia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. </p>
<p>Not to mention the insane lack of any content really. It was okay-ish for a beta but it had no business being 50gb for what it is either. They didn’t even show you how big the game was back then, only said „This is your download speed“ with a bar that slowly filled up. </p>
<p>Overall a absolute disappointment for anyone who’s been following the game since its announcement back in like 2018(?).</p>
<h2>Comment kyqhodd by payne6 on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):</h2>
<p>Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. </p>
<p>Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a "selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED."Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. </p>
<p>Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. </p>
<p>I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.</p>

<p>For me personaly it was mainly the story and art style. It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.</p>
<p>Many people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)</p>

The writing was also solid but didn't take itself too seriously and liked to be funny, which for me was a welcome change from the typically hyper serious popular MMOs of the time.</p>

<p>It has a really polished artistic style and combat that was considered pretty difficult and immersive by mmo standards. But it launched with so many bugs and performance issues it killed it on release.</p>

<p>It wasn't universally enjoyed. The game had a <em>lot</em> of problems and a content structure that was simply unsustainable and unplayable by the majority of players.</p>
<p>Wildstar had a bunch of great ideas but it was bundled up with a lot of crap. It died for a reason. Every dead MMO has a few diehard fans that obsess over it.</p>

<p>The combat was different and pretty fun. And the early days open world pvp when everyone was leveling was a ton of fun, that part was really awesome.</p>
<p>But once you hit max level it was too grindy to even get to start the end game content.</p>
<p>it had this super long attunement to unlock raids which was so bad. I get why they wanted to do it but it really just took all the worst parts of mmo’s and said “hey if you want to do the raids suffer through this”</p>

<p>That was when Daybreak didn't know who owned them for like 7 years, claiming it was Columbus Nova but oops actually it was just a guy working at Columbus Nova. That dude offloaded them to EG7, so my curiosity is more where this fresh money is coming from. EG7 bought up quite a few studios over the years despite being a weird, small Swedish dev/publisher, including advertising house Petrol. I'm still not sure where they're getting the money for much of this. There's no $2B Saudi deal to fall through like with Embracer (not that EG7 is playing anywhere near that level).</p>

<p>These are older numbers, and the Origins servers are seemingly causing a spike in players (and likely revenue), but that would be wholly unrelated to any deals they've been in the process of negotiating with S6.</p>

<h4>Comment lbbyfk2 by Greaterdivinity on 2024-07-02 [+2 votes] (in reply to lbbxvwr):</h4>
<p>Revenue from Origins is likely both a fraction of what folks seem to think it is and also very unlikely related to this acquisition at all given that it was likely being negotiated well before they launched. EQ1/2 in 2020 combined for less than $20M in total revenue. It's a great IP, but given how little SOE/Daybreak have done with it the older games are not exactly raking in the cash.</p>

<p>EG7 has $45MM of cash on hand. No debt</p>
<p>EQ1/2 probably generate $15MM per year in EBITDA. My singing monsters … $10-15MM.  Then you have Fireshine, the other Daybreak titles, Pirahna Games, etc.</p>
<p>So, as things stand, the company generates $30-40MM per year in EBITDA. Part of which they can redeploy into game development, publishing or acquisition. </p>
<p>If is a surprisingly resilient company.</p>

<h3>Comment lbem1yc by outbound_flight on 2024-07-03 [+5 votes] (in reply to lbb2wlo):</h3>
<p>I want to say that their stable of MMOs are basically all profitable. Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.</p>
<p>They also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&amp;D is really popular).</p>
<p>Plus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams. A dev for LOTRO has said that he's doing stuff solo that used to require six devs in the Turbine days, thanks to more efficient tools and content pipelines.</p>
<p>So I think Daybreak in particular has just really turned all their companies into lean operations with solid profit margins.</p>
<h4>Comment lbf6cju by Vanrax on 2024-07-03 [+1 votes] (in reply to lbem1yc):</h4>
<p>Pretty much. Daybreak has reduced these games to run enough to stay afloat but continue a steady profit margin. If they aren’t careful or use it to abuse it kind of thing, eventually it will bite them. It seems to me they plan to continue the cycle though</p>

<p>The devs made a big deal of their monetization model in <a href="https://palia.com/news/palia-business-model">a blog</a> before release. In short, they only planned to monetize cosmetics, but they'd be up front about changes.  </p>
<p>Anyone that's played a Daybreak game can tell you that's not how they operate. Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming. When I messed with Palia briefly, it seemed like the most obvious cashgrab would be to sell wait time reduction on crafting or building objects. Can't wait to see how they ruin the game.</p>

<p>Their games range on the P2W spectrum.

While it can be ensured they will implement some type of monetization for in-game benefits/rewards, the extent that it will be P2W or significantly P2W is hard to determine as they are all over the spectrum.</p>

<p>I remember when Daybreak shut down H1Z1 (Just Survive), the community was shattered. But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) </p>
<p>But they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company">Wiki</a>, at least.)</p>
<p>I've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.</p>

<p>Palia was such a let down. The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it (like adding a well requested thing behind a paywall) or instead of adding actual meaningful content they add costumes which sucked and were overpriced. Not even to get into the “mmo” aspect of the game. It’s barely a multiplayer you could go your entire Palia career and never talk to a person</p>
<p>So I can’t say someone else buying them is surprising and I don’t doubt this is the final nail for Palia</p>

<p>People are speculating $5-10MM with possibly earnouts for prior VC investors if Palia hits certain profitability benchmarks in the next few years.</p>

<p>Palia failed as a game and failed their objectives. This is the confirmation. A few years of maintenance mode milking and then shutdown is my prediction.</p>

<p>Yikes, but this is probably their only option. Either sell the company or shut it down. The game failed on so many levels, and the developers seemed to be very cocky and ignorant of any constructive critisim around the game. They just wanted an positive echochamber.</p>

<p>This probably means the game will be shut down soon, they didn't buy them cause of the game but instead cause they see potential to make something else.</p>

<h1>Cozy MMO Palia Developer Singularity 6 Has Suffered Layoffs by quinn50 on 2024-04-05</h1>
<a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/cozy-mmo-palia-developer-singularity-6-has-suffered-layoffs-2000131074">https://www.mmorpg.com/news/cozy-mmo-palia-developer-singularity-6-has-suffered-layoffs-2000131074</a>

The Reddit thread discusses the recent layoffs at Singularity 6, the developer of the game Palia, and highlights various user experiences and opinions regarding the game's quality and features, as well as employee sentiments about the company.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>



<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"The game is just not very good. For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything." (source: ky6tkrn)</li>
<li>"I've played the game since Alpha... the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was exactly what was delivered in Beta 2 years later." (source: kyauig7)</li>
<li>"The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere." (source: ky9d12a)</li>
<li>"Game is just bad. Ain't even an MMO but an instances game pretending to be an mmo." (source: ky6nw78)</li>
<li>"Palia is incredibly boring. They’ve spent more on adding outfits to the premium shop than actual content." (source: ky8511k)</li></ul>

<h2>Employee Experience</h2>

<h3>Strengths</h3>



<h3>Weaknesses</h3>

<ul><li>"Their glassdoor reviews from past employees last year also do not bode well. One mentions there were layoffs during that year too." (source: kycql6g)</li>
<li>"All mention bad leadership from management, which tracks as a closed beta player." (source: kycql6g)</li></ul>

<h2>Investor Perspective</h2>

<ul><li>"Based on the Twitter posts around 49 people were let go." (source: ky67tqq)</li>
<li>"To clarify, it hasn't 'released,' it's in open beta. S6 has done everything they can get away with to hide this fact." (source: ky6fj0l)</li>
<li>"I think seeing layoffs has a certain effect in gaming but this is probably an actual 'legit' layoff due to poor performance and lack of money." (source: kyhfbei)</li></ul>

<p>The game is just not very good. For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. </p>
<p>And for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. </p>
<p>There is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all "basic" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. </p>
<p>The character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.</p>
<h3>Comment ky83aom by Consistent-Hat-8008 on 2024-04-05 [+23 votes] (in reply to ky6tkrn):</h3>
<p>I've been following the game since alpha. The core problem with this studio is that instead of listening to <em>years</em> of player feedback, they try to control the narrative and stifle discussion everywhere they can. You can't make a successful product like that, eventually it'll blow up in your face and that's exactly what happened in steam reviews.</p>
<h4>Comment ky9fot3 by LaurenMille on 2024-04-06 [+16 votes] (in reply to ky83aom):</h4>
<p>Are they still instantly banning anyone that offers constructive criticism? </p>
<p>I was part of the exodus of players that happened when they went on their banning spree with anyone that wouldn't parrot exactly what they said.</p>
<h4>Comment kyauig7 by SyleSpawn on 2024-04-06 [+10 votes] (in reply to ky83aom):</h4>
<p>I've <em>played</em> the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was <em>exactly</em> what was delivered in Beta 2 years later. No progress whatsoever in the development, it was mind boggling.</p>
<p>All the feedback alpha player gave was repeated by people that played beta and now all those feedback is being repeated again in Steam Reviews.</p>
<h4>Comment ky9i8tr by quinn50 on 2024-04-06 [+12 votes] (in reply to ky83aom):</h4>
<p>they marketed themselves as wow vets among other things so it makes sense they conveniently ignore feedback</p>
<h4>Comment kybp9no by NapsterKnowHow on 2024-04-06 [+3 votes] (in reply to ky83aom):</h4>
<p>Sounds like the Temtem devs lol</p>
<h3>Comment ky6tw0v by quinn50 on 2024-04-05 [+46 votes] (in reply to ky6tkrn):</h3>
<p>This is how I exactly feel, you can have a more cozy community in ffxiv than this, you couldn't even sit in chairs in the game until recently aswell. </p>
<p>Forgoing the main appeal of mmos, the combat and focusing on a cozy community game and failing at the main task is a big lol, lmao even moment</p>
<h4>Comment ky6umcq by Cavissi on 2024-04-05 [+19 votes] (in reply to ky6tw0v):</h4>
<p>Exactly. I'm probably the exact target audience for this game, I grew up on mmos and harvest moon. I love life sims. But this just isn't it. Xiv has better fishing, housing, social elements, clothing, etc. And it's not even trying to be this kind of game.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean, in a almost purely chill-MMO like this, isn't this basically P2W? Or let me phrase it the other way around, isn't cosmetic like 90% of the gameplay loop of a game like this?</p>
<h4>Comment ky9iedf by quinn50 on 2024-04-06 [+5 votes] (in reply to ky9d12a):</h4>
<p>yup</p>
<h4>Comment kygee0r by Cavissi on 2024-04-07 [+1 votes] (in reply to ky9d12a):</h4>
<p>My phrasing was a bit odd on that, I meant the actual shop in game has no reason to be there because all it does is open the mtx menu, which you can always open from your menu. So the "clothing shop" doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Comment kyfkpsi by FyreWulff on 2024-04-07 [+2 votes] (in reply to ky6tkrn):</h3>
<p>Playing with people you know is impossible too. Me and my girlfriend tried for multiple days to simply invite each other to our instance and it never worked. It would either pretend to connect but not actually do it or just pretend one of us was now offline. How tf does a co-op game not have reliable working co-op..</p>
<h3>Comment kyjpj8b by FreedomFighterEx on 2024-04-08 [+1 votes] (in reply to ky6tkrn):</h3>
<p>The game baffled me so much on why it has to be MMO when there are little to nothing that encourage player to work or do activity together. Then I saw how much the cosmetics are and yea. . .gotcha.</p>

<p>When I found out they limited the amount of people to 25 per shard after trumpeting that this was a social MMO first, I just shook my head and thought, "wow they really shit the bed on that." Haven't even been bothered to think about it until now.</p>
<h4>Comment ky793i6 by Alice_Dee on 2024-04-05 [+14 votes] (in reply to ky6yl38):</h4>

<h4>Comment ky6ouxe by kyleblane on 2024-04-05 [+28 votes] (in reply to ky6fj0l):</h4>
<p>To clarify, it hasn't "released," it's in open beta. S6 has done everything they can get away with to hide this fact, and it is a symptom of a greater problem that likely resulted in these layoffs. They've got management problems.</p>
<h4>Comment ky6i3y1 by quinn50 on 2024-04-05 [+10 votes] (in reply to ky6fj0l):</h4>
<p>I mean it's an "mmo" that has been in beta / alpha for a bit and still being developed. The only money stream they have is the overpriced cosmetic store they have which is the only way to truly customize your character.</p>

<p>Yeah not suprising at all. The game is SUPER casual while at the same time being really barebones. The next post you see about Palia on reddit it will be the news that they are shutting down.</p>

<p>I was interested in Palia based on it's initial presentation saying a farming life MMO. Then I heard it "released" as a Switch and EGS exclusive and lost interest waiting for Steam. Then I saw it release on Steam only to see discussion that it really isn't an MMO and has several issues. Put the game on ignore and moved on.</p>

<p>Their glassdoor rviews from past employees last year also do not bode well.  One mentions there were lay offs during that year too.  All mention bad leadership from management, which tracks as a closed beta player.  I left after their plushie announcement because it was way too expensive for a game that wasn't ready yet and the post reeked of passive aggressive tone.  Much like they posted the first pet announcement.  https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Singularity-6-EI_IE3342660.11,24.htm</p>

<p><strong>Palia is not an MMO.</strong> </p>
<p>It's a single player RPG with other people in the town walking around. You can't even group up or do any multiplayer content. Besides, the game isn't even that great, and it looks like they ripped off Fortnite graphics 1:1.</p>

<p>Why would they cancel Palia? They just paid money to buy a studio with only one game … Palia.</p>

<p>They'll loot it first likely. </p>
<p>Maybe the company is turning a new leaf but my prediction is a monetary policy change to be more like a mobile game, then that will scare off most of the players and they'll just pull the product and move any staff that stays onto their other titles that make middling income but pay the bills enough.</p>

<p>Singularity 6 is a multi million dollar studio with over 50 million dollar investments made. Composed of industry leading developers with decades of experience. This game has been in active development since 2019 and started closed alpha testing in 2021.   </p>
<p>make of that what you want, but just keep it in mind when you criticize or defend the current state of Palia</p>

<p>Seems like people are forgetting this and when when you point this out the only arguments made in return are "it is open beta, deal with it" and "it is a free game, what did you expect?" but in such numbers it is vile.</p>

<p>this is exactly why I made this post and just tried to stay neutral\non-offensive. Just stating a fact here that many people seem to forget. Because S6 likes to paint them self's as a cute little indie company. Just trying to make a great game for there community.  Instead of the multi million dollar company that tries to make a game that will generate stupid money. In one of the investor rounds they cited ROBLOX as there inspiration for there monetization.</p>

<p>If I had caught that earlier I never would have given this game any attention at all and that's with Roblox evenly converting USD to Robux.</p>
<p>It also explains why the default clothing is kind of limited and same-y and you can't earn cosmetics or premium currency through the game.</p>

<p>That, and the whole "Just say you're poor" and "Just leave if you don't like it" is also vile. First impressions of a game are important, and if the playerbase is constantly telling people to leave, they will leave</p>

<p>another mmo that i played during both its closed beta and early acess, feral, had a cash shop during closed beta that changed to a premium currency shop with a battle pass system once it entered early access. it had a incredibly fiery downfall and shut down barely two years into its life. i am seeing a lot of similar patterns with palia, even outside of monetization, which is making me fear for its future. unless something changes drastically, i don't see it living longer than feral.</p>

<p>This is mostly done with games that try to do 100% community funded so that they keep complete creative control, instead of having to deal with investors that demand fast and huge cashflow</p>
<h3>Comment jwk6teo by waawaaaa on 2023-08-17 [+1 votes] (in reply to jwfvcom):</h3>
<p>But what did you expect from a free game? It needs to pay for peoples salaries and servers somehow theyre a business. Plus theyre cosmetics, they dont add to gameplay at all.</p>

<h3>Comment jwg0403 by PsyTripper on 2023-08-16 [+4 votes] (in reply to jwfypg1):</h3>
<p>I think the most advocated defenders of Palia are just trying to rationalize to them self's that they didn't waist hundreds of hours played or hundreds of dollar spent. It feels like that meme with the dog drinking coffee in the burning home, Everything is fine...</p>
<h4>Comment jwh79up by brtlblayk on 2023-08-16 [+2 votes] (in reply to jwg0403):</h4>
<p>The defenders are cope addicts. I remember the same type of behavior when The Avengers game came out and I was bringing up the criticisms that were repeated multiple times everywhere else. “But but but, I spent MONEY on it, and I’ve played it!!! It must be good!” No, you’re just trying to justify your bad decisions.</p>

<p>You are 100% and absolutely right. And no one here is disputing that. But most MMO developers have a lot more to show for after 4 years and 50 million. And also let's be honest, this is not an MMO. And that map size.... I say again 4 years, 150+ people and 50 million budget.</p>
<h4>Comment jwjf1il by DanielSFX on 2023-08-17 [+4 votes] (in reply to jwjcifq):</h4>
<p>I’m going to reserve judgement until the Beta is over.  There are clear signs of content expansion all over the map.  The didn’t just add cats in a weekend.  They obviously have more content locked and loaded to drip feed.  So we’ll see what ends up in the final.  Hell I still haven’t seen what this “community“ feature is all about.</p>
<h2>Comment jwh8vzd by rosemarygirl2456 on 2023-08-16 [+7 votes] (in reply to 15ss9gg):</h2>
<p>I made a comment in another thread alluding to the fact that they are not a triple A studio to make the point that they are not answering to a company like EA.  The decisions they are making around their cash shop are their own.   You had people saying they had a higher power to answer to other than their investors and they do not.</p>
<p>I’m sure their investors want them to make money but they had ample time to research and see that a 30 dollar unalterable cosmetic is not it.</p>
<h2>Comment jwg4lqm by hyrle on 2023-08-16 [+14 votes] (in reply to 15ss9gg):</h2>
<p>The interesting thing about investors is they want to make their money back and then some. So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.</p>
<p>These same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.</p>
<h3>Comment jwg9fhv by Pling7 on 2023-08-16 [+13 votes] (in reply to jwg4lqm):</h3>
<p>Fortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  </p>
<p>- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).</p>
<h4>Comment jwgi277 by hyrle on 2023-08-16 [+4 votes] (in reply to jwg9fhv):</h4>
<p>When Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.</p>
<p>I get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.</p>
<p>It's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.</p>

<p>It is still and indie studio though.</p>
<p>A big one, but sill an indie.</p>
<p>Another example is Larian, they are massive, but still independant since they aren't under a publisher for their projects.</p>
<p>Unless people understand "indie" as meaning "small studio" instead of "independant studio", in that case okay, but I've never understood it that way.</p>
<h3>Comment jwil0mx by RexZShadow on 2023-08-17 [+3 votes] (in reply to jwiac0e):</h3>
<p>I mean most people use the term indie to mean a small not really funded studio, when a studio is big enough to be its own publisher its not really indie. By your logic Nintendo is an indie company. They develop and publish their own games.</p>
<h4>Comment jwjr3nr by FoxyNugs on 2023-08-17 [+3 votes] (in reply to jwil0mx):</h4>
<p>No, because Nintendo publishes games from other studios too, and they have multiple studios under their brand. And they also have their own platforms.</p>
<p>A better example to illutrate your point would have been CDProjekt Red.</p>
<p>I guess my point would be that there are big indie studios, and small indie studios, both as independant as can be, but with wildly varying resources. Singularity 6 is a big indie studio. But still indie nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Play something else" seems to be the go to response for a lot of people who are responding to valid criticisms of the game... We're allowed to criticize the game, and this isn't something stupid like "the game doesn't allow for 240 FPS". It's pointing out that with this budget, and this amount of time... they didn't deliver much.</p>
<h4>Comment jwiwsyd by Fyzx on 2023-08-17 [+1 votes] (in reply to jwivo3v):</h4>
<p>what valid criticisms? "greedy" cash shop? that a game in open beta isn't feature complete like other games? 50 million budget always have to translate into the same game state everywhere (wait till you looked at the budget of halo infinite, just saying).</p>
<p>fact is the game is free, you can play all of it without spending money on it. either you have fun or don't. it's is that simple.</p>
<p>and no, it doesn't mean you're not allowed to criticize, if you enjoy the game it's only natural you want it to improve and have a future, but there's a big difference between constructive criticism and complaining about stuff without perspective. but keep downvoting and complaining about discord, because their hugbox is so much worse than the usual reddit hateboner circlejerk, that's totally gonna fix things I'm sure...</p>

<p>I asked this before because the $50 million number always confused me and I couldn't find any clarification. Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead. Also how did COVID lockdowns affect development?</p>
<h3>Comment jwl8wwe by PsyTripper on 2023-08-17 [+1 votes] (in reply to jwl16kv):</h3>
<p>they had 2 investor rounds:</p>
<p>1st round 18 million dollar</p>
<p>2nd round 30 million dollar  </p>
<p>and apparently some other bits en bobs totally 50 mil.  </p>
<p>That is all the info we have. They money could be all gone and they need the cash shop to survive or maybe they still have 30 mill left, we don't know. The problem is the company is as transparant as a brick wall</p>
<h4>Comment jwl9dtv by PsyTripper on 2023-08-17 [+1 votes] (in reply to jwl8wwe):</h4>
<p>but even if they had startup cost, lets say that had 20 million startup costs (what is absolutely insane) the current product doesn't even reflect the other 30 million actually spent on development. We have 2 pretty small maps and a housing plot... this is all they created in 4 years.</p></p>
