# About Singularity 6

Singularity 6 is a game development studio founded on February 27, 2018, by veterans from Riot Games. The company is dedicated to creating games that offer deeper, more meaningful experiences. Singularity 6 employs approximately 169 people and has raised a total of $49 million in funding through multiple investment rounds [(PsyTripper, Reddit, 2023-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15ss9gg/singularity_6_is_not_an_indie_company/).

The company's flagship product is **Palia**, a cozy MMO that emphasizes community and social interaction in a high-fantasy setting. Palia combines elements of farming, crafting, and social interaction, and it was initially released in open beta in August 2023. The game is free-to-play and monetizes through a cash shop that sells cosmetics and other in-game items [(Polygon, 2024-07-17)](https://www.polygon.com/2024/7/17/24199912/palia-favorite-cozy-game-mmo).

# Post ID 1bz2e0z: Palia developers, Singularity 6, axes 35% of staff just after Steam launch with +220 score by [Hexdro on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/)


## Comment ID kyn4d7g with +33 score by [generalmasandra on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn4d7g/) (in reply to ID 1bz2e0z):
I got hopeful when I read former Riot, a non pvp/combat-ish mmo years ago.

But the question needs to be asked - why play this over a survival base builder or a city builder or a Sim City type game? They all provide a more unique and detailed experience in their respective areas.

From what I remember in testing - you're basically handed a plot of land at the beginning after some quests and you can start building/questing to progress. But these plots of land were away from the main village tucked away and I thought it was an instanced zone you could see with others so they could recycle the same handful of plots.

And at that point why not play Valheim or V Rising or Palworld or something where you can build anywhere, see roughly the same number of real players or none at all if you prefer solo.

Palia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city.

And I think Palia is kind of falling into that pitfall of assuming players will group up and make content on their own for pve. A tiny minority will. Pvp games the competition is the content. But pve you need to find a way to get people to work towards a common goal.

Anyways just my rambling thoughts as someone who was optimistic, tried it out and got turned off. Sucks people are getting fired. Wish them well.

Mate, former \*big company\* generally means they're slaves to gridlock, whether or not they know it.

What you want is some scrappy bastard from a small MMO studio that had to wear a lot of hats. It's why you see old LOTRO company devs doing shit like leading Stellaris development.

Honestly? I enjoy the characters and setting.

Please don't downvote me for liking it. 😥

I have ADHD. I struggle with a lot of crafting and survival game because I can never remember the resources I need, and I always feel like I'm falling behind. I'm into a lot of high-execution games... but open world survival games generally just leave me feeling mentally exhausted.

The limited resources and the generally simple routes to obtain them is something that my broken brain can handle without feeling overwhelmed.

Many of the criticisms against Palia made hard are entirely valid. But I find the depth of the characters and the story they're involved in honestly really well written and compelling to engage with. Enough so that it keeps me wanting to come back regularly to learn more about them, despite the basic gameplay loop.

The story and characters are great, if you like those kind of stories.
For me (both queer and neurodivergent) it was heaven. I remember the announcement trailer and praying itll come out one day.
I did have a great time for about 4 weeks, since repetitive tasks dont quite stop me from having fun.
What ultimately killed my vibe was when the bug happend to me that randomizes your characters appearance and voice (back then you couldnt change voice).
Ive known people who didnt want to play their characters anymore for dysphoria, and i also lost interest because my character sounded too silly lol.
Its a game all about looks. How the npcs look, your character, your house..
How they took multiple months to add a damn voice setting is beyond me.
And thats my issues, it is so obvious that the devs were not cut out for this.

The story and art are fine and great for the right kind of player.
But the technical side of the game is an absolute mess.
Sadly :(

Played it back when it was EA... for one day. I like cozy games, i don't need always high stakes... but the gameplay loop was so insanely boring, only two zones and max. 24 other Players with you on one map. The Story was generic and kinda uninspired. The Crafting was boring... and also the whole game was not what they advertised.

The Server Structure back then was bad too. Don't know if they fixed it. I can't describe it better than, if you switched to the second zone or your home, you basically logged out one server and logged in on another server. Basically never meeting the same people again.

Edit: Basically i'm amazed they made it that far.

Palia isn't quite an "MMO" but it's still news. The developers have axed around 35% of its staff (49 people or so) which includes people from all areas of the team - from narrative writing to character design, environment artist and engineers. This news along with the mixed reception from the Steam launch, keeping the fact that the game is in 'beta', etc - the future of the game is worrying tbh.

Anyone whose into these types of games, don't bother. I played for about a month or two when it went to open beta

The studio doesn't seem to know what it's doing or they're just trying to go after whales. They made it clear that you will *never* be able to unlock new outfits with out paying real life money for it despite having a clothing shop in game...which just brought you to the cash shop...

When I played the game only had two tiny maps you could run around. The gameplay loop of the game gets old really fast.

There's no trading between players other than a goofy gifting system where you can give people stuff exchange for 1 point of something you need 100 of to do anything with, which you can get more of talking to the NPC's.

The game should have been $20, single player, with a focus on the story since that's exactly how it plays. You talk to the NPCs and can romance some of them or all of them and do their personal story as well as a main quest/storyline. There's literally no reason for this game to be online only other than the fact that they want to sell you $30 outfits with extremely limited colors.

And as for the time i was playing the only way to get a pet was to spend a bunch of money in the cash shop.

The people who made the story and characters are talented. But whoever is running the show over does not know what they're doing. It's like they looked at what mobile games do and thought it would translate to PC or something.

Reminds me of Wagadu Chronicles and all the other more... out of the box "mmos" that have come out over the past couple years. Someone, somewhere, had a unique idea, story, setting and said "lets sell this to people and let them play it" but they were too busy coloring outside of the lines (which can be genius) to actually *make a fucking game anyone wanted to play*.

They were more intent on originality and creativity than actual gameplay design. Which is a shame, because to really *change the narrative* you need both. Want to make a cozy non-violent life sim mmorpg redefine the genre? Make it fun, engaging and worthwhile. Make a good game.

I was interested in this game for quite a while as was one of my friends. We were so disappointed in how small scale the multiplayer is. Makes me sad.

This. So many fans love to boast that Palia is not pay to win. The problem with that statement is there is no way for another player to gain a mechanical advantage over another, so the typical “pay to win” scenario doesn’t exist in the first place. The only advantage that exists is a social-advantage.

Want to look cool like that player? That’ll cost $30.

There is nothing "micro" about their cash shop.

After watching multiple gameplay streams I am not surprised. It does **nothing** new or unique in terms of gameplay.

Palia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. 

Not to mention the insane lack of any content really. It was okay-ish for a beta but it had no business being 50gb for what it is either. They didn’t even show you how big the game was back then, only said „This is your download speed“ with a bar that slowly filled up. 

Overall a absolute disappointment for anyone who’s been following the game since its announcement back in like 2018(?).

Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. 

Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a "selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED."Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. 

Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. 

I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.

I think it definitely could, Dreamlight Valley is basically the same concept without the massively multiplayer (still live service and an MMO-like content model) and works. Palia monetization and future content just... wasnt done well.

This game feels like some big money laundering scheme or something. I can’t believe that many people worked on it for so many years and all they had was a bare bones product. If I was an investor I would be demanding to know where all the money went because it didn’t end up in the game.

Feels bad for the ppl who lost their jobs, but the company felt bloated compared to the product they put out. I heard they had 200+ ppl at one point (though this layoff figure puts it at 150ish). 

At the end of the day the game just isn't very good. Very stale, as others pointed out with the online aspect bringing nothing positive to the game.

In any case, Ralopd is correct. This game never had a Kickstarter at all. Purely VC funded.

Feel like this game has been in development forever and I was really excited to try it. I actually really enjoyed it but it does get stale. It’s grinding to grind. Doesn’t seem like you unlock any new ways to fish, mine, cut trees etc… decorations/collecting and such in your house are really the best part of the game and honestly my favorite thing about it. 

Game needed more progression in more ways and more interesting ways to life skill with some mini games or something. Didn’t hate it, but it just didn’t feel like it had that much to it. 

At least it felt like it worked for the most part.

For me personaly it was mainly the story and art style. It was basicaly Sci-Fi Warcraft, but it didn’t feel as “WoW clone” at all. The World Building was on point and it was all funny and jokes most of the time, but very serious when an important story archs happened. Just a perfect way how to tell a story imho.

Gameplay-wise it had everything what you wanted from an OG theme park mmorpg, but in a modern coat. Dungeons, raids, pvp bgs and arenas, ranked modes, awesome housing system, the list goes on. The best part? It released with all of that stuff. No “alpha” bullshit. Except for bugs and tuning, it just felt finished on the release day.

Many people will disagree with me, but it was THE mmorpg for me. I played from start to shut-down and I wish I re-lived it again. My only real problems with the game was the simplified gearing system ( just 1 weapon per class ) and the telegraph spell system just wasn’t right in large scale battles ( most of the ground were just green and red circles and you couldn’t see anything in battlegrounds for example.)

art style, unique environment, very unique classes and play styles (electrocute your allies with shock pads to heal them!), really cool and accessible player housing system, and for its time it was quite good on the graphics and polish.

tbh it was a fun game with lots of problems.

The combat was different and pretty fun. And the early days open world pvp when everyone was leveling was a ton of fun, that part was really awesome.


But once you hit max level it was too grindy to even get to start the end game content.


it had this super long attunement to unlock raids which was so bad. I get why they wanted to do it but it really just took all the worst parts of mmo’s and said “hey if you want to do the raids suffer through this”

$5M, as a "non-core" IP which is hilarious and sad. Unsurprisingly, the PS IP as a whole, minus PS2 which Toadman took over (what's Rogue Planet Games even working on now? Who knows), isn't worth shit after so many years of SOE/Daybreak shitting the bed with it.

That was when Daybreak didn't know who owned them for like 7 years, claiming it was Columbus Nova but oops actually it was just a guy working at Columbus Nova. That dude offloaded them to EG7, so my curiosity is more where this fresh money is coming from. EG7 bought up quite a few studios over the years despite being a weird, small Swedish dev/publisher, including advertising house Petrol. I'm still not sure where they're getting the money for much of this. There's no $2B Saudi deal to fall through like with Embracer (not that EG7 is playing anywhere near that level).

These are older numbers, and the Origins servers are seemingly causing a spike in players (and likely revenue), but that would be wholly unrelated to any deals they've been in the process of negotiating with S6.

Revenue from Origins is likely both a fraction of what folks seem to think it is and also very unlikely related to this acquisition at all given that it was likely being negotiated well before they launched. EQ1/2 in 2020 combined for less than $20M in total revenue. It's a great IP, but given how little SOE/Daybreak have done with it the older games are not exactly raking in the cash.

EG7 has $45MM of cash on hand. No debt

EQ1/2 probably generate $15MM per year in EBITDA. My singing monsters … $10-15MM.  Then you have Fireshine, the other Daybreak titles, Pirahna Games, etc.

So, as things stand, the company generates $30-40MM per year in EBITDA. Part of which they can redeploy into game development, publishing or acquisition. 

If is a surprisingly resilient company.

I want to say that their stable of MMOs are basically all profitable. Especially something like EQ, which doesn't necessarily have the highest player count, but something like 80% of all players subscribe, which is an incredible conversion rate for any game.

They also have stuff like DCUO, LOTRO (at a time when there's a lot of LotR media coming out) and DDO (at a time when D&D is really popular).

Plus, like MassivelyOP pointed out once, all Daybreak games have essentially paid off their initial development costs and are running with super small teams. A dev for LOTRO has said that he's doing stuff solo that used to require six devs in the Turbine days, thanks to more efficient tools and content pipelines.

So I think Daybreak in particular has just really turned all their companies into lean operations with solid profit margins.

The devs made a big deal of their monetization model in [a blog](https://palia.com/news/palia-business-model) before release. In short, they only planned to monetize cosmetics, but they'd be up front about changes.  

Anyone that's played a Daybreak game can tell you that's not how they operate. Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming. When I messed with Palia briefly, it seemed like the most obvious cashgrab would be to sell wait time reduction on crafting or building objects. Can't wait to see how they ruin the game.

I wonder if Palia fans will figure out that (as the game is now) there will be zero impact if pay to "win" (heavy quotes) or pay for convenience is added to the cash shop.

I'm not saying it's good or the right decision, but gameplay-wise, that will have no impact on free players ability to enjoy the game. It's such a single player experience.

Their games range on the P2W spectrum. Ex: EQ is very different than EQ2 when it comes to P2W and both are different than DDO... heck even the EQ2 Origin servers change significantly in the amount/type of P2W. While it can be ensured they will implement some type of monetization for in-game benefits/rewards, the extent that it will be P2W or significantly P2W is hard to determine as they are all over the spectrum.

I remember when Daybreak shut down H1Z1 (Just Survive), the community was shattered. But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) 

  
But they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company), at least.)

I've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.

  
1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.

2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)

  
For now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.

Palia was such a let down. The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it (like adding a well requested thing behind a paywall) or instead of adding actual meaningful content they add costumes which sucked and were overpriced. Not even to get into the “mmo” aspect of the game. It’s barely a multiplayer you could go your entire Palia career and never talk to a person

So I can’t say someone else buying them is surprising and I don’t doubt this is the final nail for Palia

Sony charged you for the Landmark Founders edition. 

Sony then sold to Daybreak, most of the existing Sony management was uprooted/fired/left, new Daybreak management was placed and they made the decision to cancel Landmark.

You got caught in-between an acquisition and an uneconomical game. 

Your blame should lie in Smedley. Daybreak didn’t sell you a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow … they just killed a game development that would have bled them dry.

Agreed. There are just as many red flags with the management of the product as the actual development. Most people point to the Switch version as the reason for certain limitations, but let's be real. The Switch can handle much more than what Palia is throwing at it.

The game is just not very good. For a life Sim it lacks basic features, the decorating is nice but you can hardly interact with anything. Especially in town. Benches you can't sit in at all, a tavern where you can't sit eat, drink, nothing. 

And for an mmo it's like 20 people in a town map, and your alone in your home instance. They could have done a neighborhood like xiv so you can at least see some other houses without having to ask to be invited. 

There is a clothing shop but it only sells clothes for premium currency, all "basic" clothes are just unlocked from the start. The shop is basically purely cosmetic as well since you just buy it from the store, from anywhere. 

The character creator is pretty barebones as well, for a fully social game with no other real content besides rp. Like two body types, 4 faces, and maybe 20 hairstyles. This should have had City of Heroes level of customization or more.

I've been following the game since alpha. The core problem with this studio is that instead of listening to *years* of player feedback, they try to control the narrative and stifle discussion everywhere they can. You can't make a successful product like that, eventually it'll blow up in your face and that's exactly what happened in steam reviews.

I've *played* the game since Alpha (I think 3 years ago), the core problem is that what was available in Alpha was *exactly* what was delivered in Beta 2 years later. No progress whatsoever in the development, it was mind boggling.

All the feedback alpha player gave was repeated by people that played beta and now all those feedback is being repeated again in Steam Reviews.

Their glassdoor rviews from past employees last year also do not bode well.  One mentions there were lay offs during that year too.  All mention bad leadership from management, which tracks as a closed beta player.  I left after their plushie announcement because it was way too expensive for a game that wasn't ready yet and the post reeked of passive aggressive tone.  Much like they posted the first pet announcement.  https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Singularity-6-EI_IE3342660.11,24.htm

Because S6 likes to paint them self's as a cute little indie company. Just trying to make a great game for there community.

I made a comment in another thread alluding to the fact that they are not a triple A studio to make the point that they are not answering to a company like EA.  The decisions they are making around their cash shop are their own.   You had people saying they had a higher power to answer to other than their investors and they do not.

The interesting thing about investors is they want to make their money back and then some. So they want the company to put more effort into the cash shop than the game. Welcome to the realities of the F2P model.

These same criticisms were made of Fortnite when it launched.  It's gone on to do just fine, and had continued to have a cash shop of cosmetics that don't affect gameplay.  As long as it's strictly cosmetic, I really don't see a problem.  100% of the game (incomplete as it might be) can be experienced with paying a dime.

Fortnite was basically fully actualized as a product though. The problem with Palia lies with priorities. Many systems are unrealized and unpolished compared to other games like it (from much smaller studios) yet the cash shop is already up an functioning. It also begs the question, what are their motivations for doing things the way they do them? Is making the game online in itself done just to sell more cosmetics? Are they going to forgo a more interactive pet system in lieu of one where they can sell cosmetic only pets?  

 \- In a game with such few systems cosmetics play a much larger role in motivating a player. The fact that it's open beta only makes the emphasis on MTX items that much more glaring of a problem (because there's basically nothing to work for at some point).

When Fortnite was in beta, it wasn't a finalized product, though.  It had far fewer features than it has now.  It didn't have several of the systems it has now.  It had far fewer game modes.  In fact, it spent years in beta.

I get the concerns over lack of content in Palia.  I even get concerns about cosmetics costing more than people want to pay (let's face it... any price over $0 is going to be more than some people want to pay.)  But it must be remembered this is a recently-opened live service game that's in beta and shouldn't be critiqued as if it's a complete game.  Even the fully-launched Fortnite continues to evolve, and I'm certain Palia will as long as it is profitable enough to keep it going.    And if it's not profitable, then like hundreds of live service games before it, then it'll close shop as so many F2P games have done before.

It's understandable that some might not like the direction of that evolution - and it's fair to critique that - but I'm just saying the expectations for a beta should be far lower.

One 50 million dollar game does not make you major...at all.

I’m really enjoying the game so far but there are a lot of things wrong & predatory about their model, I’m trying to remain hopeful that s6 will see all the reviews, feedback from players and take it into consideration to implement the appropriate changes, it means a lot to gamers when we actually feel heard by the devs 🥺 but I also won’t hold my breath

It is still and indie studio though.

A big one, but sill an indie.

Another example is Larian, they are massive, but still independant since they aren't under a publisher for their projects.

Unless people understand "indie" as meaning "small studio" instead of "independant studio", in that case okay, but I've never understood it that way.

I mean most people use the term indie to mean a small not really funded studio, when a studio is big enough to be its own publisher its not really indie. By your logic Nintendo is an indie company. They develop and publish their own games.

No, because Nintendo publishes games from other studios too, and they have multiple studios under their brand. And they also have their own platforms.

A better example to illutrate your point would have been CDProjekt Red.

I guess my point would be that there are big indie studios, and small indie studios, both as independant as can be, but with wildly varying resources. Singularity 6 is a big indie studio. But still indie nonetheless.

who cares tho? if the game is fun it doesn't matter if 5, 50 or 500 people worked on it. same if it's not fun, with the added question why not simply play something else?

trying to read the tea-leaves what might or might not happen or the "state" the game should be in doesn't really matter.

inb4 "muh defender" - company size has no bearing on personal enjoyment, if it stops being fun why bother. and unless anyone was dumb enough to pay money for something he doesn't enjoy, all you wasted is some time...

"Play something else" seems to be the go to response for a lot of people who are responding to valid criticisms of the game... We're allowed to criticize the game, and this isn't something stupid like "the game doesn't allow for 240 FPS".

what valid criticisms? "greedy" cash shop? that a game in open beta isn't feature complete like other games? 50 million budget always have to translate into the same game state everywhere (wait till you looked at the budget of halo infinite, just saying).

fact is the game is free, you can play all of it without spending money on it. either you have fun or don't. it's is that simple.

and no, it doesn't mean you're not allowed to criticize, if you enjoy the game it's only natural you want it to improve and have a future, but there's a big difference between constructive criticism and complaining about stuff without perspective. but keep downvoting and complaining about discord, because their hugbox is so much worse than the usual reddit hateboner circlejerk, that's totally gonna fix things I'm sure...

I asked this before because the $50 million number always confused me and I couldn't find any clarification. Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead. Also how did COVID lockdowns affect development?

but even if they had startup cost, lets say that had 20 million startup costs (what is absolutely insane) the current product doesn't even reflect the other 30 million actually spent on development. We have 2 pretty small maps and a housing plot... this is all they created in 4 years.

They'll loot it first likely. 


Maybe the company is turning a new leaf but my prediction is a monetary policy change to be more like a mobile game, then that will scare off most of the players and they'll just pull the product and move any staff that stays onto their other titles that make middling income but pay the bills enough.

As an mmo player I love the idea of appealing to nonmmo people as us mmolads are shit for the health of mmos.

We rush max level and devour all the content available in record speeds, then with our downtime we bitch about how easy or how little of it there was, then we min max everything and complain about balance.

I'd love to see how an mmo with majority nonmmo player base that's more casual develops naturally.

I think it will depend. The MMO playerbase is very diverse in general, but it's fairly safe to say it's not going to appeal to those LOOKING for a PvP or competitive PvE experience. But if an MMO to you is moreso exploration, fun activities, socializing with less emphasis on combat (although afaik there will be some combat activities) then sure.

I liken it a lot to Free Realms. That too had combat, but it wasn't the main focus.

Palia sounds like its going to be "open world" Second Life. It could be good. I don't see it attracting the mmo crowd overall, but it sure as hell will attract all the Second Life players and there are some cross over people there too. Second Life was (is? idk) very popular but it was a rather specific crowd and I think this is probably the only game I've seen since then that reminds me of it. It'll also pull in a lot of the Animal Crossing crowd too I bet.

Here's a quote from one of the devs:

Combat? We're not ready to get into detail on this yet, but we'll have both combat like systems, such as Hunting, and eventually more traditional combat. Like most of our skills, you'll be able to choose your level of participation in it.

"There will be group adventures, maybe dungeon like, but we won't have huge raids that require lots of prep and grinding beforehand"

So yeah, probably not a lot of that.

I would assume it's going to be quite close to Stardew Valley in that regard. It has some combat, but it definitely isn't a major focus.

Thats what mmo genre might need. Traffic from all toes of gamers. A lot of 5-10 person multiplayers had been targeting mmo players in past.

Um, people that play the Sims will be the target audience seeing as there is no combat and that isnt me.

I'd say moreso Stardew valley, harvest moon, but sure, sims too maybe.

It will have combat. There will even be some sort of dungeons according to the devs. But they just won't be competitive nor mandatory. It just isn't the main focus and that's fine.

sigh, I just don't understand why people overhype things like this :/ especially when we barely know anything of this game or how it will play. All it has right now is just marketing fluff and concept/scripted gameplay shots from the trailer

why not just hope for it being good and waiting till release before making hyperbole statements like this

thats fantastic. mmorpg budgets need to be measured in the 10's of millions instead of just millions like all the kickstarters. if they keep the scope someone limited so that what they release is really high quality 30 million is definitely enough to get the product out the door and then slowly build onto a successful mmorpg.

What's weird is that I'm an old school "PvP server, full loot" kind of guy most of the time when I think about MMO preferences, but I'm stoked for Palia. The idea of a chill, living world just really appeals to me at this point in time.

I think what I really miss from old school MMO's is the sense of community, discovery, and feeling like I'm really exploring another world. I hate gear treadmills, and I want emergent gameplay with other real people instead of just rerunning the same dungeon with rando's to get a shiny new sword/helm/etc.

I think SWTOR had a budget of about [500 million](https://www.gamesradar.com/analysts-eas-stake-old-republic-probably-approaches-500m/) 10-12 years ago right? I'm consistently skeptical (and more-so by the day) when I see "MMO raises ___ funding"

The scale of these things and the number of users buying in has to be absolutely facebook level for them not to fail it feels. It seems anything short of 100k subscribers is almost a waste of everyone's time?

Am I just jaded or have we just seen too many promises and millions of dollars vapor ware. 

While I'd never preach against it I just feel that MMO's are one of those things you need a "coalition of companies" (preferably ones with deep pockets) to be in on together. 

MMO's aren't the kind of thing where you can have the player go "it's not bad" they have to be absolutely revolutionary and excessively fun because they require a massive influx of users at the same time, and that's almost impossible to do.

yeah anyone quoting wow's initial budget as "look what you can do with 60m$" has no idea how costs have skyrocketed since then. 

With what people expect these days you have to also add in a)better graphics b)better UI/UX c)hesitancy to pay subs d)MASSIVE competition that didn't exist in 2003 

and whole host of other things. Back then people would try out just about any MMO. These days people are far less likely to invest time and money unless it's amazing. There's an expectation it won't stick around and there's just too many options vying for our time.

The game itself has a lot of potential.  But it is important to make it feel like a game. It needs to still have game mechanics. Things that make you strategize, react, pattern recognition, and hand eye coordination.

If you just make a sims or animal crossing but in open world..i dont know if thats enough.

Lots of phone games do this: cut down a tree poof lumber, hit a rock poof bricks, click the empty field poof house.  Thats not enough for me.  Maybe for other folks but i need to feel like im playing a game still.

Thats why i never could get into second life or entropia.  Entropia had hunts but they were pretty shallow tbh.

I hope this one is different.

# Post ID 15sufww: [REPOST] OPEN UP YOUR EYES with +262 score by [ArrynMythey on 2023-08-16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/)
Few days ago I posted this to spread awareness and open up your eyes that Singularity 6 is not a small studio with a small budget. Also it explained what the beta testing is.

The post was removed for breaking the rule 3 as many of you noticed and I was banned. I had a discussion with u/I_Am_Batgirl to settle this. The post break the rule 3 because I edited it and added a link to a website that contained list of the Singularity 6 employees (their names to be precise). Though this was a public information we discussed why it is not a good idea to post it here and came to an agreement.

The ban was lifted. So here's the original post (without the link to that problematic list) + some more thoughts at the bottom regarding the current situation with the latest patch.
___
I was reading lots of post, positive and negative ones. And I think there are few things that must be said.


&#x200B;


Devs are not begginers.


>Today, our team includes top talent with experience at big studios like Blizzard Entertainment, Epic Games, and Riot Games; among others.


[link](https://www.singularity6.com/news/we-are-singularity-6)


&#x200B;


The Singularity 6 company is not as small as you think.


>Singularity 6 has 169 Employees


[link](https://growjo.com/company/Singularity_6#company-overview)


&#x200B;


The budget for this game is really big.
EDIT: For better perspective read the top comment below, from u/SyleSpawn


>Singularity 6, the developer of the the MMO Palia that has echoes of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild, has raised $30 million in Series B funding to help fuel the development of that title.


[link](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palia-dev-raises-30-million-to-support-the-mmo/1100-6493473/)


(this was in 2021, today the budget was said to be around 50 millions)


&#x200B;


Beta testing - there shouldn't be much of a missing content. It is testing before release and its goal is to test whether everything works as intended. It's also servers stress test.


>A beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain several known or unknown bugs.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#cite_note-8) Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software and speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts on users, often incorporating [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing).


[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta)


&#x200B;


This said the game is in a horrible state. There are missing features and content. It is not what it was advertised as. It is not an MMO, it is a singleplayer game with shared world.


The attitude that these devs cannot do wrong is toxic and will make the game flop. If they will lock themselves up in an echo chamber they will not change anything thinking this game's a masterpiece.


Don't settle for low standards. If you are satisfied with crap, you will eat crap. Push them to make the change. You want this game to succeed. How can this game succeed when the feedback is mostly negative?


&#x200B;


You can enjoy the game and I am not disregarding your fun you have with this game. Still you should be able to recognize that this game has severe problems.


I mean saying "it is a bad game" and "I'm having fun" are not mutually exclusive. At least that's the mindset I'm trying to push.

___

The latest patch that added only few items to the game and more items and pets to the cash shop proved what this studio (not devs only, the whole studio) really is. Their priorities are milking the playerbase and not making the game they promised.

The release date knocks on the door and the game is lacking so much - from basic features to missing content.

If nothing changes with the game's official release, this game will die a slow death.

This raises the question - is there a something that we can do?

In my opinion the only way how to get the game that was promised to us is to try to notify the devs and push them to be transparent with their roadmap. They must show us what their priorities are and stick to them. They destroyed the trust of many of us. We must be loud and they must listen.

The word will spread. If nothing changes... We know how this ends.

I would like to further add one point to your post so that people understand what kind of funding the dev received. The devs raised $49m through investors. People doesn't seem to understand what kind of game can be built with $49 so allow me to provide some example:

- [Monster Hunter World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/) development + marketing was $50m.

- [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/) was $30m. With marketing it added up to $50m.

- [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/) development + marketing was $47m.

- [The Outer World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/) development + marketing was $30m.

- [Control](https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/) development + marketing was $30m.

Compare the visual fidelity, the vastness, the sound, the voiceover and the general quality of these games against Palia then tell me again that Palia costed $49m and 2 years worth of microtransaction sales (MTX was available since Alpha back in 2021 if my information are correct).

Haha, these games are so out of league when it comes to what we have with Palia that it's not even funny. A list of successful indie games would probably be a better comparison, and even then, Palia would look absolutely ridiculous. The only interesting feature was the fact that they marketed it as an "MMO," which completely fell flat.

The intent of my post was to let the reader understand what you can do with $49m! But you're pretty much right, Palia is not close to that league at all.

Comparing Palia to smaller indie games would be even more unfair... for Palia. Most of the other indie games that are in the same genre as Palia seems to cost around $500k to $3m in general.

This is wrong.  Sorry.  Knowing someone in the industry, this is incredibly off base.  Are they paying people out of this?    Unless they are getting paid nothing, there is no effing way haha.  And I’m only speaking to the triple A games you listed.  

Horizon said over 47 million.  Didn’t give an exact cost.  And the second one was over 200 million?  And they even had the assets to work with.

Sekiro has 1000 people in the credits.  Maybe not all of them were paid but the engineers alone would be getting paid nothing in comparison to other companies if the game took 5 years to make.  

Most successful game companies are paying way over that so I don’t know.  

The issue is most companies won’t tell you exactly what it costs to make their games.  Not exactly.  Palia unfortunately didn’t have that luxury for whatever reason.

Palia is shit but 50 million over 5 years is not a lot of money.  Sure they could have done better and we should expect more, but game development is incredibly expensive.

EDIT: And just to clarify, I DO think they could have done better but it honestly comes down to lack of ideas.  They padded the eff out of their resumes and received funding and didn’t know what to do with it, period.  There are flashes of good ideas but it’s not really coming together.

I think this is why it's important for the studio to address people's concerns. Because people will dig, and what we find can look incredibly bad at face value. Apart from one or two general messages from their community management saying "we hear you", which is essentially them just asking players to trust them, there hasn't been anything. But that trust has been getting worn, and they needed to be more proactive with addressing specific concerns before that trust got completely broken. Even to just avoid any misunderstandings/potential misinformation from getting out of hand.

Just to add to that:  
If you pay your devs 3 000€/month (not even that high for senior devs with lots of experience)

3 000 \* 12 \* 5 = 180 000 (total salary for a single dev through those five years of dev)

180 000 \* 190 employees = 34 000 000, two third of your budget gone, only in salaries.

Those aren't MMO's, they're from established developers. Once you have everyone trained and tooled making new content is a lot cheaper, easier and quicker. (similar to hand coding a website vs using shopify.)

There's a lot of development with servers, databases, and developing programs and systems for designers to use that costs a lot of time and money, none of which we see.

New World was $200 million. WoW Vanilla was $100 million adjusted for inflation. That team had so much already to work with and also had horrible bugs. 

This is beta we're seeing the framework being put up, give it a month or two for the front end devs to work with it.

Palia's state have been literally the same for 2 years. The game you're playing today is the same game that alpha testers played 2 years ago. I don't know what significant change you expect to happen in the next 2 months.

Also yes, new studio but today's tech helps development a hell lot which arguably make development less costly than before specially for a game like Palia.

Will they, though? I doubt it. There simply isn't enough content and so many annoyances that it takes quite some dedication to keep playing a long time. And that's what makes me really sad about this whole situation. I WANT to love this game! *In theory*, it is everything I want. In the state it is in though, it is like a caricature of what I want. 

I was thrilled to get into the closed beta, and the first evening was awesome. Then I tried to sit on the chair I just built, only to find out I could not interact with it. I don't even have a sit emote. I built a chair, but I cannot sit on it. Who thought this was ok? How can you make such a design decision for a game like this! I am sure there must be people on the team who are full of *I told you so!*, because they raised many of the issues that people complain about here, but were overruled. Not making the furniture interactive is a "Don't you guys have phones?" moment. 

I played a few more evenings, but I haven't logged in again for a while now. I'm massively disappointed.

I mean, how can this still be something people don't know:

Devs barely have any creative control over when to release, in what state to release or even the monetization of the games nowadays, especially with foreign Majority Investors like FunPlus (often known for his Blockchain/NFT and Mobile games).

You think any Developer enjoys shipping a half assed game that needed at least 6 more months in the oven? Hell no, especially considering, that most of them don't even earn a whole lot or profit from the monetization himself. That's like blaming one of Nestle's Secretary's for the evil the firm is doing.

There should have never been any trust to begin with. With majority foreign investors, all that matters is the bottom line. They do not have any connection to the game, they do not have any reputation to consider and they do not have an IP/Brand that would suffer from exploitative monetization or shipping a half ass-ed product.

That doesn't mean that the Devs are completely innocent. Not at all. Just that it was idiotic to have any faith in a foreign funded game to begin with. 

Welcome to corporate game creation.

Well that's on the developer too. Not like they were remotely rushed, 5 years of development time and plenty of money. This isn't like they only had 2 years then investor suddenly was like you need to release this now so we can see money return.

Its been 5 years, they had plenty of time to create heck a lot more than what's there now. The fact they have to release it in this state is completely on them. They knew what they were getting into when they got those investment. They were the ones who sold the game and probably a delivery time line to the investors. They were the one who couldn't keep that promise.

Even if the investors were forcing them to release early the current state does not match what you expect out of the time, money, and man power put in. In fact if I was an investor I be asking question about wtf they been doing all this time.

Like I said, i'm not trying to defend S6 here, I'm merely responding to some of the notions flying around this sub. **The Game is in a sorry state, should have never been released that way under the excuse of beta and whoever was part of the decisions that led up to this should be fired on the spot**. However,

Let's start with probably the most simple thing. The game was releases **early.** That's indicative of the development fund not being fully utilized. That's the whole point of releasing something early. To generate return on investment before the development is done. There could easily be the last 10 Million lying around.

Thinking of "The Devs" of a hedgemonious group is stupid to begin with. The Dev team grew by almost 90% last year. With the same growth rate in the year before. Looking at the current employee number and inferring what they should have created retroactively is beyond idiotic. Especially in a new studio, newly formed team that literally doubled in size multiple times over the last 3-4 years. Anybody who worked in the corporate world knows (especially those that have worked in IT), that most new hires produce a net negative in progress for the first X Months within a studio (aka eating more time than they actually spend in a useful manner).

I said it before, i say it again. Anybody who "put trust into the game" and expected anything other than we have received was an idiot. A royal one.

This is exactly what anybody should have expected. Games nowadays rarely release in a good state. Some of them get good over time, some do not.

Agree 100%. If you like a game, and it's asking for criticism, feedback and it's still developing, then you want that game to even better and you should voice your opinions now. I don't understand the attitude that if you like it then it can't have flaws.

Let's try to make it even better, it obviously has potential, that's why people get heated about it. And I hope the devs really take it to heart and make changes that will also benefit the players who can only be there F2P for whatever reason they might have.

You have some legitimate criticism but I'd like to point out some things.

1. Working for big game studios doesn't mean as much as you think.  If they were just junior devs they didn't make any decisions and just did what they were told to.  For all we know most of them worked just on UI.  I would say they are beginners to making a full game but being beginners isn't an excuse people should be using anyway.
2. We don't really know how many FT permanent employees they have.  You can pull up numbers from many websites but those numbers will most likely include contractors who just did temporary work like VO or concept art.
3. The budget part is interesting to be honest but I can't make a judgement on the money situation unless I see financial statements.  Maybe they're actually a company that pays their employees really well and gives great benefits.  If they pay 10 employees 100k a year that's 1 million USD just for those employees wages for one year and if they really have over 100 full time perminent employees they could be spending upwards of 10M a year on wages and benefits.  The point is that 50M doesn't go that far in this economy.  Especially when that's what's made over 5 years.  
4. Many, many games go into beta (even release) missing secondary features like FFXIV 2.0 for example.  I'm willing to give them a bit of a break on this.  Mostly because the NPC content currently in the game is massive even if the story and map isn't.  

Honestly I think what we should push for is public financial statements more than a roadmap.  Singularity 6 isn't publicly traded so public financial statements aren't required but I think it would do good for the community to see them.

That being said I was disappointed in the patch yesterday but I personally realize it's only been 2 weeks since Closed Beta launch and not even a week since Open Beta started.  I'm personally going to give them some more time because they can't just shift what they were doing suddenly based on feedback.  Changes take time.  Coding/development takes time.

These devs are not beginners by any means. 

The studio threw around big names like former Blizzard and riot employees and what not like they're a hot commodity to wear. 

Of course that budget gets spent mostly on paying the employees, but it begs the question, even if they were paid really well, WHAT have they been doing with all their time at work for the past 5 years that justifies these wages/salaries. That's what it boils down to. 
Because right now it seems like they got paid insane wages to sit around for 5 years and put together an entry level project. You really can't ignore how barebones this is. It's an alpha that just has a beta tag sticker slapped on it.

People pad their resumes all the time.  Also 50 million seems like a lot but is kind of ass in the tech industry if you actually divide that by number of employees over 5 years.  Most devs would make much more working at other companies, just wouldn’t have the benefit of possibly making bank individually off of a successful game.

All that to say, I think the game is not in a good state and there is a possibility they are scrambling.  Only reason they would make such a bad decision releasing this, calling it beta and STILL releasing it on switch by the end of the year.  They overshot and now they need a plan B.

Interesting points. I will explain what I meant with my statements.

1. The excuse I see the most is that all the devs are beginners. Many of them probably are ones but they are lead by experienced people.
2. People often called them an indie studio in a way they are small. Yes, they are independent, but not small.
3. Compare this to the games in the top rated comment here (the one I awarded). If they really pay that well for doing barely nothing I will gladly join them.
4. Release date is close, I don't think they will change much. Especially when you see the official list of known issues (I made a post about it, check my profile).

&#x200B;

Public financial statements is really great idea. We need more transparency in general. Although I don't think they will give us these statements since we are not investors and could show the company in a bad light.

1. Depends on how experienced.  I would say that a new studio should be given more leniency than an old one with many releases no matter who the leads are but still less leniency than a studio of only non experienced personnel.  
2. I think it's an issue with the definition of indie.  Some will use indie to mean not a major studio with many games under their belt will some will use it to mean only small studios that fit that criteria.  It's the same in music.  I think the semantics of indie, and MMO, decrease the legitimacy of feedback though.  And I mean that for "both sides".  
3. Those games were all backed by large studios.  There's more to a company than just money.  Like did those budgets include the need to pay for hardware?  Or on-boarding?  What about legal representation?  This is why I think financial statements are a good idea.
4. Eh.  I think release will be December and I don't see that as close.  They also are talking about having content patches every two weeks with bug fixes in-between.  I have cautious hope but if that hope is sustained will depend on the next patch.  It died a bit with the patch yesterday since it was so small.

Agreed that we need more transparancy.  I like the transparency we've had about feedback.  It shows that most of the devs probably don't even know the community feedback yet since the Community Management Team is making spreadsheets and powerpoints as well as trying to moderate.  I actually feel kinda bad for them.  They've got a lot on their plate.

It could also show them in a good light.  Though honestly, lots of people don't understand financials of business (I only know a bit due to a college class if I'm honest) and they could probably be misread.  It might open a can of worms.

It effected everyone to a degree, although game development like most of the tech is easily able to work around it given the nature of how everything works. But ya definitely effected them but still doesn't explain the state game is currently in.

Multiple Alpha testers have stated that the game hasn't really changed too much in past 1-2 years and that's post the worst lock down part of COVID.

Like Alpha testers been asking for furniture interaction for almost 2 years and still nothing. Even though the trailer they show off in 2021 specifically had someone sitting on a couch drinking tea and the trailer said its based off the Alpha.

After the budget, pedigree of the devs and the amount of time they've had -   

1. No interactions with furniture - laying on beds, opening wardrobes, sitting on stools/chairs etc
2. No facial hair, or any kind of character customization
3. No real social aspects in the game

The alpha testers were banging on about all three points a couple of years ago !!!!

I asked this before because the $50 million number always confused me and I couldn't find any clarification. Is that the budget for the game itself or does it include the budget for establishing the studio legally as a business, leasing office spaces, buying equipment, hiring employees, and other start up costs? I haven't been able to find a solid answer to this so if anyone has a source I'm genuinely curious. I keep seeing people compare them to other studios, but it's always studios that are already established and (I would assume) don't need as much overhead. Also how did COVID lockdowns affect development?

It's hard to say about the uninstalling, as far as I know they don't track how many people uninstall the game, but if you don't think you'll play it wouldn't hurt to uninstall.  
I also think that if you truly enjoy the gameplay it's fine to play without paying too. Personally my biggest issue with the game is the cash shop (premium currency that doesn't match up with IRL currency) everything else seems ok right now and I have hope that it will improve. Obviously in time I could be proven wrong about my hope, but I don't want to jump ship without good personal reason either.

When did they say they're beginners? I personally don't care if they're pros or beginners. If they are pros, then they should show it and need to show it.

Every game you listed had a team of 300+ except Control (45). Palias team is actually kinda small. And as for the cosmetics everyones upset because of them? Planetside 2s dev team has 25 people and has well over 500 cash shop items because the game is *free to play*. 

The budget.. I'm surprised on, I still see it as irrelevant though, because *drum roll please*  Planetside2s budget was 30 million and the ps4 release was another 30 million..( apparently?) 
APB Reloaded was 50m-100m and it's free to play with a horrible cash shop.
Firewall (rip) cost 100 million with a dev team of 195 employees.
Ans there's StarCitizen.. 400 person team with a budget of 500 million+

( The numbers are just development costs. Not marketing)

 

Beta testing I agree on, they're really should be more to this game, especially after find your shepp. At this point they might run out of players before the full set of features are a thing?

They need to work on the MMO aspect because it does feel like it's single player with the ability to see others in a generic gameplay loop.. not enough to hunt, needs some RP aspects.. y'know sitting? Using furniture? More group activities?

Cash shops may automatically sour some people's moods but in general, it doesn't have this much of a negative effect IF the game actually feels complete, has the basic features they promised, and has either quantity or quality (or both!) to their existing content. What I and many others have as an issue with the cash shop in Palia is because of this statement of yours actually....

>Beta testing I agree on, they're really should be more to this game, especially after find your shepp. At this point they might run out of players before the full set of features are a thing?

The cash shop and their item prices DO NOT match the game's current state. This is beta. We are supposed to be testing their shit, not buying items (unless it is done to, again, test things and provide feedback. In which case, the currency should be given for free so players are able to test their cash shop features without having to actually pay real money). 

The game being free to play isn't the main concern here. It's because the game doesn't have much to show for but they're wanting you to pay $30-$60 for cosmetic items. This also extends into the topic of trust. Which is important for people to enjoy their game and to continue supporting it. Currently, their monetization feels predatory partly because of how closely it feels to all those other instances of games whose sole existence was to become a cash grab. It's a reasonable worry as it happens pretty often, and the studio needed to focus on building their playerbase's trust. Not to play fire with one of the major things that have been causing people's loss of confidence.

I agree on this, I was just trying to compare the two, but yeah Planetside 2 is a complete game with all features, Palia is not. They should have built the features FIRST then implement the Cash Shop after and all before Beta testing.

> The cash shop and their item prices DO NOT match the game's current state. This is beta.

And same to this, Beta is testing, not buying, I am guilty of buying the Rogue outfit, I love cosmetics in games. When APB:Reloaded did it's UE3.5 test, everything premium was free, for testing, and was wiped after. 

Maybe I'm being too optimistic and assuming buying things helps them out a bit, because I really DO want this game to flourish, it's got the potential, they just need to get to the grind stone and show us, or hire more employees.

This is probably why I havent really played much, I hop on to do my garden and thats about it. I've been playing other games in the mean time while updates roll out because theres nothing else to do?  
Equally, WHY IS IT SO BRIGHT NOW? Nobody asked for this?

I agree with the post, but the changes to the game and bug fixes are not in their voice no matter their experience. The decision come from upper management, not developers. Being a dev in gaming industry is not comfortable, because if one of them say something against, there will be another dev in place. Many young people want to work on video games until they burn out. Then they leave to more stable companies where consumers and devs are both respected.

Ok so everyone is kinda panicking about this, but it's actually quite normal, the closer a game gets to launch or completion, the more layoffs happen. It happens at Rockstar, it happens at BEhavior, it happens at Square, happens at Nintendo, etc. 

They hire a larger staff than needed and then they lay off the extra developers so they can get paid before their next project. 

A small company like Singularity 6 that offers a *FREE* game can't keep paying extra people. So what they do is "have a free vacation, see you in a few months when we need you again". 

It's absolutely normal and part of gaming development. 

Singularity now has to focus funds on boosting servers because they'll be working on a hard launch. 

Game developers are nomadic. Think of it as movie work, the film is over so everyone goes home. They lay them off so they can get unemployment for a while until they need to bring them back. 

The people publishing these articles are basically shouting, "Water is wet!"

So don't stress about this, it's a normal cycle in video games. The lay off is a kindness so they'll make some money in-between jobs. 

Most of the time, they hire the same people back.

I don't think it's over. I hope not... 

The only reason I don't think it's over is because they haven't made an attempt to actually monetize the game. They have a big enough dedicated player base that they could start monetizing more than just aesthetics in an attempt to be able to avoid the lay-offs. But they aren't. Which makes me think there's another reason for the lay-offs. 

These could have been temporary positions that were created for the main creation of Palia, that have now run their course. It doesn't make it any less sad, but it would mean that Palia will continue on. It seems that they're laying off primarily art designers, which could just mean that they've completed the majority of the art design and no longer need that many people.... 

Even if S6 goes under entirely, I'd imagine that they'd sell the game to another developer. It's more than established enough at this point for other companies to be eyeballing it. It's also possible that they've already quietly sold it and haven't announced a merger to the public...

I'm surprised they're giving the game away for free. I'm happy they are, don't get me wrong, but with as much as I've played, I would feel comfortable paying around $15 for it just to keep the servers running.

They definitely aren’t thinking about monetising anything at the moment. I haven’t been able to buy any cosmetics (it’s been a known issue for a while apparently) & they aren’t in a rush to fix it. If this was any other game, they’d fix it in a day worrying about losing profit.

They would lose mountains of players if they tried to charge. It’s about as simple as that. You want me to pay you to fish and mine and shoot deer? No thank you. Because that’s all the game is right now. The only world in which they could attempt to fully monetise the game would be doubling the content and still adding more from there. And I don’t see that ever happening, especially with less staff.

They probably need a huge influx in cash, but don't expect many new things to come. Just whatever the last of the crew worked on for the last couple months. I would expect monetized content to be released so they can further prevent the collapse.

The community manager(s) have been in charge of patch notes, status updates, Content Creator management, and then handling the Discord/maybe the Reddit, as well as other forms of player communications aside from direct feedback via the game/website. Practically anything related to the community ties back to them.

There were 4 of them, but they slowly left or got laid off over the past few months, with the last being just laid off. Until someone new is assigned to their tasks, we have a lot less communication and info going forward.

I think what they are doing is saying "The world and gameplay are finished. We don;t need you anymore. Costuming will be our profit model, so those people can stay."

To be totally honest the FTP model is almost impossible when you have such limited revenue streams. I think they are starting to realize how little money this game is really going to make vs how much they are spending on development.

In an effort to navigate this tough economic period, we had to let 36 of our colleagues go yesterday. Asherelle, who has been a truly invaluable member of our team and this community, was unfortunately affected.

i think one thing you forget is that stardews a 2D primarily single player farm sim- and it took years to put together by ConcernedApe. MMO'S especially with the graphics palia has arent something that can be easily made with just a few good devs- especially not when theyre laying off such big creative roles which clearly had impact on creating a 'soul' for palia. the game already has a lot of flaws- though also a lot of potential still- they cant really afford to lose such big creative assets. im hoping there is a proper reason behind it.. its very much a game in that middle ground for me rn where i can see how it has so much potential but the focus/love for it seems to be a little 50/50 :/

Maybe I’m just making it up in my head but after they did that first big round of layoffs right after the update released, there’s so many bugs now and my game crashes all the time on switch. 

It wasn’t till this recent update that I actually had more than maybe 2 full crashes happened while playing. Now I get two for ever hour I play and when I go to other people’s plots. It’s been frustrating, along with seeing a lot more little bugs all over the place than before. 

I will pay money for this game if it means they’ll keep the staff needed to help fix bugs and progress the game more! 😔

Seems like the cozy market is in the middle of a shakeup, Fae Farm staff also got a huge layoff.

Im hoping this round of layoffs can keep them afloat but I also hoped the last would, it's a shame and I REALLY hope the work they have in the pipeline can see the light of day and this game make it to launch, it's still my main cozy game and its just about to get over that hump.

The infrastructure is there now, they just need a few holidays and another map or 2 and I think it'll go more viral. Hopefully they are making enough from the store to pay these 60 employees until they get over the hump and this is a long term decision.

I don't want to be terrible and kick them while they are down, but I really feel like a lot of the issues are to do with this games clothing market.

90% of the outfits are outlandish, what I've just been sitting here holding my wallet for are just basic cosmetics like a male straw hat (like Badruu's) or cloths closer to what npcs wear. Instead we get ninja outfits? My wallet just looks at all the clothing being offered and it's always just so over the top and not for me. I just want to feel like a part of Kilima and I just have so few outfits to choose from that fit that vibe.

Like I have spent 30 bucks on this game...and I really couldn't tell you another outfit I'd buy that I didn't already. Every time I see a new outfit release it's 3 more outfits I would never wear or I couldn't really use pieces of. 

I really think they need to release some more down tempo outfits like "farmer" and "fisherman" and make them blend with other things. Like I spend how many hours fishing but I can't buy waders? No fisherman's hat? No straw hat in the entire game but there is one on Badruu's head? It's like, I'd buy all of these just to wear while I focused on one profession. Instead we get outfits....for being a ninja? In a game with ZERO combat? ZERO stealth? 

Its just sad it's the only way to support the game and I just have very little interest with what is on offer.

I hope they can ride this lull and get out Elderwoods before it gets too bad.

I really think if this game get get out another map or 2, 2-3 more yearly festivals, and some more housing building options, I REALLY think they have something special.

And I don't say that about a lot of games.

I agree with everything, especially the clothing.  I likely would own more if the pricing was better as there a few I do want but not for that much. One user commented that they prefer chasing whales as whale are more lucrative, yet that doesn't seem to be the case here.  Plus the removal of the MMO label makes it hard for a subscription type model you see on most MMOs...So, I hope they can think of something to help fill their coffers.  There is a lot of potential here, and I want to keep experiancing the world they started creating.  I hope they find some money and a concreate vision for the  game, soon.

I really think if they just did a line of profession outfits from farming (straw hat) to fishing (waders and a rubber hat) and so on...they'd make a lot more money across the board.

Because what do I make my outfits for? WHAT IM DOING. If I plan to go fishing? I put on shoes that look like I could get them wet. If I plan to go hunting? Guess what, it's something with some leather that makes me feel like a hunter.

But they just don't.

They keep going for these big ticket high input glowing items...but yet I have nothing to wear while Im fishing? The only chef outfit is just a meme it would be embarassing to wear that as a chef in public. There is one gardening outfit and it's like the kind a doll would wear. Meanwhile Badruu is just in a white tee with overalls and I'd wear that in a heartbeat.

It just feels like they don't really understand their market and instead of selling us "Stardew Valley" cloths or "cute small town cloths" we are getting ninja outfits and high tech outfits and a bunch of things that aren't even in the games lore as far as we know.

Sure you'll catch the occasional whale with a ninja fetish but you aren't going to catch the MAJORITY of your audience which is just people who want to do the professions the game offers.

I agree with this sentiment. I think there are different revenue streams that can come solely from in-game cosmetics and irl merchandise that wouldn't affect the game play. I saw someone mention ads on loading screens and I wouldn't be opposed to that if that's what it takes. They could even do an ad-free tier subscription (with cosmetic perks) like the streaming services have started lol...

Going to need full transparency on what's happening and what the strategy is and how likely it is to work out, and exactly how dedicated the company is to *making it* work out, because right now, the total silence with no word on how the community could help while they lay off their staff to a skeleton crew looks a whole lot like they're already shutting down.

Exactly this. The first set of layoffs I was advocating that everything is fine because of course after the actual game development is pretty much finished they obviously don’t need 100 staff members. That made sense to me. Now this?

I agree, and from the replies, most people are not willing to, or if they are not as frequently as they might otherwise be were they priced differently. They are quite expensive where I am, and it's not just the skins, its the packages I would need to buy to get the currency that always force you to get that extra to encourage another purchase, and another.

I also bought from them, but only because it's a free game and I do have money to spend and want to support them. But I kinda hope that if it becomes a paid game those who have spent money on it don't have to again. Although I wouldn't really mind, everyone don't have the ability to. I would also hate for it to become PTW, I hope they can keep afloat
 Atleast I would've paid for the game, and I only bought in game value for the support because it really is a good game, and I would really want them to keep going.

Honeslty I think there should always be a free option, and a paid for option. that way they won't lose all of the people who can't pay for it.   
But you can pay for it to get access to more premium content if you want/can.

Hopefully the game survives all of this, and pulls through. I really, really enjoy this game. It's become my after work go-to. From a long day of stress, it's the perfect thing I need to unwind and relax. 
I do feel bad for all those employees, though. 😥

Keep playing the game and making purchases (if they are of good value to you). You can also voice your support for the game on social media platforms like you're doing right now. Ultimately these things always come down to profit. The publishers need to see that the game is either profitable now, or has the capacity to be in the future based on the player base. 

The layoffs don't necessarily mean that the game is in trouble, though. It's possible that they needed a larger staff to get the game off the ground and now they feel they'll be able to sustain it with a smaller team

If they had just listened to the community about this when it started, instead of focusing on their investors. We were all falling all over each other to support them. But then they did the weird underhanded currency thing, the cleansing of reddit and discord, and after staying away I finally came back to find a TOOOOON of cash shop stuff and almost as many glitches as when I left after Beta took off.

I’m disappointed because there is just so much to love about this game. Let this be a lesson to all you other developers out there: Make the game to be played, not just to get paid. The reason FFXIV works so well despite the monthly premium AND cash shop is because the team behind the game put the players first. Always. (except for Viera hats but we don’t talk about that) Loyalty comes when the community knows you see them as fellow gamers, not cash cows. 

You might be able to turn it around now if you put a monthly premium in place, release the cash shop outfits and pets to be part of the game, and focus only on fixing bugs, not cash shop items. Maybe.

I’ve already been pretty disappointed by the speed and trajectory of the game and as such have a backed away a little and that was when they had double the people and now they’re half the size and still don’t have a game that offers meaningful and lengthy game play? Yikes. :/

I am going to reply to myself and add my own thoughts and opinions.

As I have mentioned in a few replies to others, layoffs are normal once the bulk of development has been completed. My main goal in sharing this information is simply to keep everyone informed. That being said, there are some signs worth noting.

While the current wave of layoffs seems to be happening uniformly and likely in relation to the completion of development work, the speed and timing of these cutbacks suggest there are no long-term plans for significant future development. Layoffs of this nature typically occur when a game is almost finished and transitioning to maintenance mode.

Unless the promised updates are the last of them, relying on reused assets can only sustain future development for so long. Although they could rehire at a later date, it still indicates a lack of current plans. This winding down at this stage is unusual and likely related to financial constraints. If they are tightening the belt for financial reasons, it does not bode well for future development.

However, as I also mentioned in my other replies, we won't know for sure unless they communicate directly with us. Right now, we have promises. If those promises are kept, great. If not, then we'll have our answer.

Still, in no way am I currently saying the game is in any danger, only that its worth keeping an eye on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: The user [celosia89](https://www.reddit.com/user/celosia89/) has left a reply in this thread, in their reply they have posted an update from the community discord, that explains some of the current situation. Our fears were founded as these layoff according to the discord post, were related to "hard economic times". They do still claim to be focused on the development of the game, but apparently could not say more. 

With this new information, I say now it's time to be a little worried.

If they have financial forecasts that indicate a certain income level, they can cut back to a dev team size that supports the projected income. Maybe internally doing it in waves made it so a cerain project cound get finished using investment funds or something.

My point isn't "you are wrong", just "here are some reasonable alternatives".

In any case, believe what you see, not what you speculate.

I’d like to introduce you to seven days to die.

I started playing seven days to die in alpha 13, in 2016. At that point, seven days to die was three years old. 

It is now 2024. They are on Alpha 21 and were talking about releasing Alpha 22 this year. However, a few weeks ago they announced that instead of releasing Alpha 22, they were finally going to release the completed game. 

11 years later.

For comparison, Palia was first released June 2021. The open beta for windows was only released August of last year. Palia is still in infancy.

I think they should start considering other ways to monetize this game. I still believe it should remain free to play, but they need additional rev streams besides prem outfits. Maybe they could consider ads? I think most players wouldn't mind small ad placements on every loading screens if it helps keep the game free, alive and supports future updates, and hire/keep better people.

Honestly ads won’t do much, they would be better off marketing individual items from their current clothing pack options and making them a lower micro transaction price. That alone will bump their sales. Additionally they can implement seasonal only items or promo purchasable items that players can buy in a small period of time. Theres also the option to create an outfit customizer that-allows you to say, pay 1$ more for the blue option of the sunglasses that cost 1.50$. If they broke up a 30$ outfit into 3-5 separate purchasable pieces I think they would see more new players spend money.

It was clear for a long time that this monetization model was not sustainable, and I 100% agree that some for of subscription model would have made sense.  yet with the pivot from MMO to single player, makes the subscription idea not that great.

Micro transactions. They might see more money if they made individual outfit pieces cheaper and easier to buy. You can sell 1$ water bottles to a million people and make a million dollars before you find twenty people to buy all that water and make a million. Membership or subscription is not realistic for a lot of since we already pay for internet and even access to the web if paying on switch on top of needing wifi connection.

Everyone pays for internet these days.. it's a staple like water. They should just set up a monthly subscription service IMO. I hate these free to play games and usually stay away from them. Usually you end up paying way more for them than you would an openly purchased game with DLC. I can't imagine what they were thinking when they set up this business model. I have bought over $300 of clothing but I doubt I'm the norm. Prior to the influx of Switch and Steam players, most everyone I saw had premium clothing on.. that is not the case any longer. They've had an influx of players who can't or won't buy. They need to charge for access IMO.

if they would just shift their business model to mirror in-app purchases on the apple app store where you spend $1, $5 or even $10 increments instead of the only in-game purchases being $25-50+ they would be making a much more comfortable profit to sustain their staff bc the reality is people just dont feel comfortable casually dropping 20 bucks anymore in this recession, but i may end up spending $20 in $1-5 increments over the course of a few days and i feel like many other players would as well even simply for the sake of supporting S6 in whatever small ways they can

I agree. Case in point, outfits that can be mixed and mashed. Instead of just a top, bottom, and headgear, they can separate pieces like in other RPG games where you can equip idk, prolly a back gear, a belt, accessories, etc. and then sell the pieces separately. They can also offer skins for the tools and weapons. I’d totally buy those.

If they lowered the skin prices i would but more of them, use to think buying my daughter Fortnite skins was expensive, but would happily accept those prices here.   I would even accept there shop style here, give me new cosmetics to buy every few days, and make them reasonable...I like Skins so would buy them.

I felt bad enough after the last layoffs but now I really don't think I can continue supporting the game, especially with those who made the discord so welcoming and open being laid off. If anyone can suggest any similar games I'd appreciate it... just don't feel the same love for it I once did :(

SunnySide came out on Friday. It's a 3D farm sim set in an aging Japanese town.  The art is a bit anime style and the game has been influenced by Persona a bit.

You start off with a large plot of land where you can grow over 100 crops that you water with a hose or an irrigation system. You can have four plots of land altogether. 

There are 32 NPCs and you can date 25 of them.  I went into the demo with 3 characters I wanted to date and came out of the demo with 4. It only took 3 or 4 times of talking to the character for me to want to date him. 

Note - There are bugs but the developers are working on them. The background characters don't have faces just like in anime (I haven't watched much anime and I haven't paid attention to the background characters so I don't know how common that is).

I'm worried about the game. My wife and I just started playing and love it a lot. We both have 20-40 hours into it so far, and the biggest issue is how expensive the few purchasable items are. They have a lot to accomplish to make the game more welcoming to people, but they also need to readjust the store, add more items, and have a better fixed spending point. I'm not spending $34 for skins and a pet. Id spend $10 immediately. But not $34. 

As someone who's played MMOs a lot of my life, it always baffles me how with all the success and loss history devs can look at over the hundreds of MMOs, why not take the best and implement it into a game? 

Do a season pass like halo mcc. Always accessible, you can go back and get items from it at ANY time. 

In house or out source art for skins that cost $5-10 each. Make them appealing enough to want, but not over spend time and money to create. This will allow players to not feel bad about $$ and still support the game. 



I hope the game doesn't tank, though. I can see myself putting 100 hours in the game easily.

Not surprised. Either they were useless or they are giving up on the game because it was all a scam. I'm leaning towards giving up on the game. With the money they had to create the game alone, and the money they've made from the stores for virtual items, etc..... I dont see why layoffs would be required. 

It might be a bit of both. Horrible up front development leads to awful beta leads to horrible retention leads to poor spending in shop. 

Everything they've done from a shopmetic pov has seemed pump and dump to me. Like a last ditch effort to make any money. None of the decisions they've made have made sense from a community retention perspective.... i had so much hope for this game but it just did not turn out for me or any of the people I knew who were excited to play it.

To people asking to pay for experience boosts, just stop. Buy cosmetics, ask for merch maybe, tell your friends to join! But don’t ask the devs to change the game system.

Don’t forget — Stardew Valley was made by like one guy. And while the scope of the game is a different … 

…The size of a team isn’t so much important as to what they can bring to the table. If they can bring out quality content, manage their community, and fix bugs with the size they have, then that’s great. 

What I think would help - and what may have said here- is a better monetization structure. 

Also they should have a road map — also mentioned here. This not only help us gamers to see what the future holds - but also gives the devs an idea on what they are working on. 

Only time will tell what will happen to Palia. There has been no communication that they are closing servers. So imo it’s a bit premature to start worrying.

Sad thing about those is Bethesda was not going through hard economic times and was simply laying off unneeded staff, as for Trove, its still a great game after selling off parts, its just dying now because of old age, still the same game.

Where they to sell this game, that could be good, but the likelihood if it being sold to someone who cares isn't that great. And since S6 doesn't have the deep pocket and experience of Bethesda,   layoffs in the middle of beta, in relation to hard economic times doesn't bode well for Palia.

Its hard to say at this point, unless they tell us. In some cases this can be normal as the larger part of development winds down, they may be in a comfortable place and not need all those people. If the artist have done their work and assets are stored, and everything is good. Then this may be ok. 

Or it maybe a publisher clearing house for profit and not caring about the actual game. If they expected large profits from their cosmetic shop and are not getting it, could be a reason to start tightening the belt.  If they did not expect a profit yet at this point, and it is just normal progression of time and layoff..we will be ok. Only way to know is if they tell us, as most don't until the doors are closing.  I still have hope as small teams are not uncommon after the brunt of development is done.

Probably the same boat as every other venture capital fiasco in the tech world. You get more funding by aggressively hiring and touting infinite growth. More money feeds that cycle. 

Eventually you have 150 employees when you only need 50, aren't reaching the impossible milestones you set to impress investors, and are *still* unprofitable. Then the charade crumbles. It's a big reason why there were [at least 84,000](https://layoffs.fyi/) tech company layoffs so far this year (S6 is included by name in that count). Doesn't necessarily mean it's over unless people want to cut their losses. Layoffs are usually just a correction. 

No disrespect to those laid off; it's a fault of the industry's model.

I wonder when developers are going to realize MMO's cannot be successful without a Sub model. Ive watched a bunch of really good games collapse under the weight of a cosmetic/token model.

Because they’d lose the majority of players. If we could afford a subscription, we’d still be playing WoW or Elder Scrolls. 

I’d say expand cosmetics to include plushies, decorations, etc.

If this was an issue, I can't imagine why they wouldn't introduce a subscription of some kind. One can be whipped out somewhat out of thin air - they could call it something cute and give a couple hundred tokens and a free gift every month for it, and people (I'm people) would eat it up no questions asked. I'm already paying a subscription because I want to support the game, it'd be great if that happened more automatically.

So I don't think it's that, but I'd like some transparency from company side to explain these layoffs.

This exactly. If they did a 5$/mo sub model where you get like x amount of coins and a cosmetic like even a shirt or something each month. I'd sign up for it. Many other games do this. Rec Room has one  I believe its 8$/mo you get coins and a discount on the premium store.

GaiaOnline, 5$/mo, its called an Angel Subscription. 1 Free cosmetic each month and 700 of their coins.

Note my example is from games where its also free to play. So they can still keep free to play and have a sub.

Honestly this is really damaging to the game as well, I was tempted to buy some clothes but hearing about layoffs outs me off massively because they're so expensive and if they game is going to be shut down then I don't want to risk it.

If the game is shut down I hope they patch a way to make it offline/instance hosted co-op, as far as MMOs go this one isn't to reliant on it and I feel like it could be done although always online games VERY rarely get offline patches which is a pity

This makes me very concerned. I'm not likely to invest my time and efforts into a game that is laying off so many people.

To be totally honest the FTP model is almost impossible when you have such limited revenue streams. I think they are starting to realize how little money this game is really going to make vs how much they are spending on development. 

Only making profit off of costuming means that only those workers directly related to making costumes are needed. All other game functions are not profitable.

And now since the last patch update, it seems the layoffs have had a serious affect on coding and now we're experiencing so many bugs (more than I've seen with previous patch updates), that only the original coders would be able to resolve....potentially. Either way they need to get it sorted because the current bugs, which will more than likely be an affect of the layoffs, are putting me off playing :(

Because they’d lose 80% of their players. So many current players can’t afford a monthly fee.

I stopped playing WoW and Elder Scrolls because I can’t justify the $15/month. 

I can and do buy cosmetics when I have wiggle room to help support S6, but they need to expand the premium store - add decorations, plushies, whatever - as long as it doesn’t affect game progression (I.e., no pay to play stuff).

I don’t think they’d lose 80% of their players but it would def be a risky move. I think makes sense to charge for an amazing game though. I think it does NOT make sense to give it out for free. I just hope this doesn’t bite them in the butt. I’d be more attracted to more lower priced items. Limited time items or small charges that add up, rather than expensive  outfits.

The Paypal option just constantly refreshes without letting me input anything, while the credit card option hangs on a blank page after hitting "pay." I've tried windowed mode in a lower resolution and I'm very hesitant to reinstall the game for a *possible* fix. Man... I can't say I've ever had such a hard time trying to give someone money. I really wish they'd just have a website outside of the game to purchase coins. Whatever in-game browser they're using seems buggy as hell.

You might want to reach out to PayPal or whatever platform/software you are using. This doesn't sound like a dev issue? Is your computer running on all the current updates?

Nah I am sure it's their imbedded browser on the PC version. Switch works fine for buying things actually, and that's how I "solved" this.

I think the lesson here is that cozy + traditional F2P is cursed. You actually can't make a cozy game with lots of player agency and self-direction while gating/monetizing in the traditional ways.

It's counterintuitive but very clear in hindsight, but selling cosmetics (which makes sense for many other games) is actually incredibly toxic and frustrating in cozy games where cosmetic progression tends to be one of the core pursuits.

It's the cozy equivalent of pay to win, as noted by a commenter in another thread.

I don't think any of the warped expectations or missed targets for multiplayer helped, but this was probably a doomed strategy without some innovation on the monetization side specifically for the cozy experience.

Where Palia dissappointed me personally was how it claimed to have been all about personal freedom, but the tutorial is very, very long and holds your hand incessently. I get why, they want to hammer the social aspect home into new players, but it feels a bit too much.

There's also not really a 'world' persé: There's a wealth of loading screens everywhere to seperate personal instances.

I think it would have worked better as a normal b2p singleplayer game. As a forever game it doesn't offer enough for the long run.

Been working here over a year now and I still love it like the first day!

## Pros

The team, the project, and the goals of the studio are fantastic. In all my years in the industry, I've enjoyed working here the most.

## Cons

I honestly don't have any cons at the moment

## Advice to management

None

Amazing team, fast paced and exciting

## Pros

Leadership team, vision, culture, effectiveness when WFH

## Cons

Does not support permanent WFH for certain roles

## Advice to management

Keep recruiting people who have the experience needed but most importantly people who continue to embody our core values


# 5 stars by [Senior Software Engineer on 2021-10-15](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Singularity-6-RVW54041118.htm)

Wonderfully collaborative

## Pros

I've been in the industry for over two decades. Companies like Singularity 6 are rare. It's welcoming and open. Every voice truly matters. 
The team is diverse, but despite our many differences we have the same goals. Everyone takes amazing pride in their work. We also spend exorbitant amounts of time making sure everyone is treated well, is happy, and works on tasks that they enjoy.
The company has gone through explosive growth in the past year while putting a lot of effort into maintaining that culture. 
Production is stellar. No crunch so far, and lots of effort put well ahead of time to ensure it does not hit in the future.
The project is tons of fun. Everyone plays the game regularly. Players love it. Feedback is open, frank, and widely shared. Leadership listens. 
One of the very few studios out there that is run by creatives, by folks who play and truly love the type of game we're making. It shows.

## Cons

Working from Home may eventually be coming to an end (which some see as a Pro)

## Advice to management

Just, keep doing what you're doing. Keep listening to little voices.

There is no specter of "Family" attempting to make employees beholden to the constant grind of slipping release dates and crunch. You can throw out most of what you've heard about Gaming Companies and culture too.

S6 employees get to focus on what they're hired for, leveraging their skills and growing new ones. We are upfront about role expectations and very often make accommodations for folks that feel compelled to contribute in new spaces and/or grow as individuals.

Our HR team has worked incredibly hard to generate candidates for roles that include a very diverse set of potential candidates and we make a specific effort to reach out and be inclusive to the various minorities that are specifically under represented in the industry.

The product is well thought out and everyone involved is invested in making it excellent. I've never worked with so many eager and supportive folks.

## Cons

There is still a lot of game left to make and your plate can seem very full at times. This is mitigated by our no-crunch culture mentioned above but the company cannot hire fast enough.

Leadership can sometimes lag on lower priority follow-ups and communication.

Each team prioritizes its own work so coordinating cross team efforts can get unwieldy fast and sometimes causes feature work to lag on for multiple sprints.

A wonderfully place to work

## Pros

* The people at Singularity6 are the most emotionally aware and sincere I have had the privilege to work with in my career.
* I've never worked at a place that is more cognizant of the human experience. The culture, the work processes, and the game all keep in mind how amazing and difficult it is to be a human. This extends from what it's like to build a game as a developer into what it's like to be a player of our game. 
* We think long term, doing what's important over urgent far more often than even large companies with stable budgets do. Our financial investors in the company make this possible too, keeping our focus on the long-term over short term gains. 
* The work-life balance is good, any extra time I dedicate to work comes from my own passion for the project. I'm actively encouraged by my leaders and peers to take time for family and myself. Taking an afternoon off because you've had a hard week is normalized. We have open PTO as well, which our leaders demonstrate taking time away from work is critical to our long-term success. 
* The game we're building is simply delightful, bringing a much needed warmth and coziness to the industry at a quality bar that makes me intensely proud to support building it.
* We're building a live service game. We're here to build a relationship with our players that could last a lifetime. For a data practitioner, this means my contributions will be critical to our long term success, connecting developers to the players at-large in ways that can't be achieved with box product launches.

## Cons

* As with most startups, we're figuring out how best to organize and collaborate across teams as we scale. While S6 has done a remarkable job, particularly during a pandemic, at staying connected, we struggle with projects that require multiple-team coordination. This challenge is also well known and discussed, making it possible to try to improve things rather than just accepting it as it is. While I enjoy the challenge of helping shape how an organization collaborates, if you're looking for well-defined and stable team responsibilities, S6 may not be right for you. 
* While we talk openly about the challenges of creating a diverse workforce in engineering game dev, we are having a difficult time making progress in this direction. While I believe, given our values and culture of respect, people from underrepresented groups would flourish here, we haven't demonstrated the ability to hire diverse candidates yet. Part of this can be attributed to a very senior staff, which skews both our network and our candidate pool, but we need to do better in this space than we are now. 
* While work-life balance is good, it does require self-discipline to balance your time. This project is really exciting and we have a lot of passionate and engaged people. This enthusiasm is contagious and if you're not experienced at holding yourself accountable to other commitments it can absorb a lot of time. The upside is everyone is aware of this and is thoroughly supportive (like I mentioned above) of your away from work. We're in this for the long run.

## Advice to management

Continue to foster this wonderfully sincere group of people. As we scale, know that this will require delegating that responsibility downward, relying on sub-teams to foster their own unique sub-cultures as inspired derivatives of the original Singularity6's culture. 
In service of diversifying our team, I think we're finally making some steps in the right direction there - ensuring we're actively seeking a diverse candidate pool and now hiring for mid-level roles where previously we were only looking for senior candidates, but we've built quite an uphill battle for ourselves given the team we have now. We can do better here. I truly believe we could be a shining example of how diverse perspectives bring about the most amazing games.

Feel Heard and be Passionate

## Pros

They took the opportunity to send out a survey as covid restrictions were being rolled back and actually listened to our feedback. That came about as Remote Choice: on-site with paid relocation, a hybrid situation, or fully remote. Also competitive compensation and incredible community support when we haven't even launched yet.

## Cons

Definitely some growing pains as processes for a small studio were quickly exhausted with recent hiring sprees.

Great people, not a great org

## Pros

Lots of great people.
Get to work with game developers from many disciplines.
Likely to have monetary success for at least a year or two.

## Cons

No career growth or mentorship.
Long delayed or skipped "annual" reviews and compensation updates.
No support of leadership. Over the past year or so, 9 engineers left, 7 of which were tech leads or managers.

## Advice to management

Ask your employees directly what they need and listen to them.

Fired without warning after 3 years due to disagreeing with engineering leadership

## Pros

A lot of great individual contributors that are passionate about the project

## Cons

Misguided engineering leadership. The goal of leadership should be to grow their teams/divisions/organizations. To maturely call out failures in the org and lay out a plan to improve them. To question and test assumptions. And to inspire others to follow direction instead of expecting obedience. Not to be afraid of being questioned and lashing out at those who do so.

I never received any negative feedback in Lattice (our performance review tool) and never got an annual review in the 3 years I was there, never had a mention of being at risk or an underperformer, no PIP, nothing. Then had a personal disagreement with engineering leadership on topics they know are problematic in the company during a 1:1 and, the very next week, they fired me.
They also originally hid that it was a firing when they shared with the rest of the company until enough people reached out to me and learned otherwise. Then they edited the Slack message announcing my departure.

To clarify, I am not saying leadership failed by firing me. Sometimes firings are the best move (though, I do not personally think that is true in my case, you don't know). I am noting that why it happened, how it happened, and what things occurred and did not occur are all serious concerns for the company going forward. Hopefully something they can address in a timely fashion.

## Advice to management

Embrace a feedback culture. I thought I was going above and beyond what was asked of me, was way more productive than others, pulled into every tech design meeting to help clarify and help across all engineering teams... so if there were any actual concerns, I was never aware of them. And I am always looking to learn and grow, so I wish I knew what the issues were. Besides voicing my disagreements. Growth is key at all levels. Including leadership. It shouldn't be feared.

Nice idea, poor execution

## Pros

Really beautiful art Care about the customers Friendly people with good intentions

## Cons

Management does not listen to people who know how to make games. Ridiculous siloed team structure Poor communication, bad leadership Inefficient Low quality results

## Advice to management

Stop trying to convince the team your trendy philosophy of team structure is superior even though it's clearly not working. Put qualified people in leadership roles and let them make decisions.

Good Intentions, Lackluster Processes

## Pros

An inclusive culture with many talented developers who are passionate about games, and the overall studio drive towards making a great product that management tires to facilitate.

## Cons

Despite the good intentions, the studio structure is a mess with multiple product teams competing for the limited bandwidth of key talent. Lots of recurring meetings without a clear purpose or outcome. Decision-making is slow and convoluted, with a wide range of stakeholders that need to be informed, and few of them willing to be responsible for any decision without talking to CEO first. That becomes an issue when the studio headcount is over 150.

Great idea seems to be lost

## Pros

Wonderful, smart, incredibly hard working and passionate team members. Everyone cares deeply about the work.

## Cons

The company preaches a lot of ideals - but something seems to have shifted or been lost and it isn’t living up to the ideals it espouses. It is unfortunate. S6 has the potential to be great, but is in fact, just another toxic company. There is also very little forward planning. Everything is a mess and constantly changing - which effects teams across the org.

## Advice to management

Listen to the people you hire. Trust people to do their jobs. Less micromanaging and more forward planning.

Not Transparent

## Pros

-Good people -Game looks cool

## Cons

-Leadership gave everyone a line about the game doing great, etc etc and then proceed to do layoffs less than a month later. -Not stable, I wouldn't leave a position to work here. -Very reactive, feels like there's no real vision. Just responding to whatever the criticism is. No design vision, just chasing trends. -Riot bias in leadership which definitely limited the diversity of thinking

# 1 stars by [Anonymous on 2023-11-04](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Singularity-6-RVW81533541.htm)

Don't work here.

## Pros

Leaders are charismatic and good at pitching a vision. 

Talented and intelligent ICs

## Cons

- Management across the board has a chronic inability to handle feedback. Feedback only ever goes in one direction--downwards. This applies to frontline managers all the way up to top leadership. This is despite parading a feedback culture. ICs who provide feedback have the feedback turned around and weaponized against them in performance reviews or elsewhere. The company is packed full of very talented ICs who are deprived of the support they need to succeed, and then blamed and take punishment when things don't go the way leadership wants them to. 


- Dishonesty and deceit is rampant in communication to employees. Never have I seen such a level of dishonest behavior from leadership, especially at such a small company. I can understand a need to be careful on what information to be transparent with, but the leadership very frequently, intentionally, and blatantly lies to everyone at the company about the state of the company. The sad part is that these lies are very shallow and most people see through them, but they serve their short-sighted purpose of keeping the illusion of the "everything is fine" dog. One example is telling everyone there will only be a few weeks of "targeted overtime, not crunch", knowing full well that it would last indefinitely for many.

 - Diversity problems explicitly ignored by leadership because it's not a "priority," despite the large human impact of them. The company made big promises around D&amp;I to employees, and has failed to live up to them. And recently things have gotten much worse. 

There are many other problems I did not list here. I fear that many more good people at the company will be hurt by the reckless course management is taking the company.

## Advice to management

Stop shutting down when people who try to give you feedback, and take a look introspectively to understand why things are turning out this way. 

Treat your employees like HUMANs, not livestock who need to be controlled and be told everything is fine until you send them to the slaughterhouse.

Outlook not so good

## Pros

Game and studio values attract great talent, plus offering remote choice work and decent salary bands. Depending on which team you work on, as long as you don’t have to witness the mess of decision-making processes, you could have a creatively satisfying experience.

## Cons

Beta launch in August of ‘23 made it hard to ignore the problems with leadership…Rigid thinking, no long-term roadmap for business or game, and basically a lack of self-awareness. Very little capable/experienced management, that breeds crunch, teams that are not aligned, competing engineer resources, wheel-spinning, and new priorities near-daily.

People are super nice, but might be too nice and not speak up. But our input doesn’t seem to make a difference in leadership choices so maybe people are just burnt out and it seems like “nice” because they're submissive. Also a lot of core people who really cared are voluntarily leaving the studio.

Compare these GD reviews from before August of ‘23 to after. Pre-beta launch the studio was buying the dream, but now we are seeing the reality is not good.

## Advice to management

Studio – Hire for people management experience, or help train your people managers for better alignment or persuasion. Develop and stick to mid-to-long-term roadmap goals and milestones, and think realistically about resources you have on hand. Stop changing the priorities all of the sudden.

Game Dev – Improve the core experience and fix the frustrating bugs and broken player accounts, and add time to testing content. It’s embarrassing how many typos and errors are shown to our players because we’re rushing and not leaving time for testing.

Talented developers can't shine in a dead organization

## Pros

Extremely passionate and talented ICs in all departments (engineering, art, design, data, etc.), decent salary, unlimited PTO, option to work hybrid/fully remote (only really relevant if you're based in LA/OC)

## Cons

- Dishonest leadership: laughable lack of transparency regarding the company's roadmap and financials
- Opaque decision processes
- Subject matter expertise and decision-making power is concentrated among a few individuals
- Company claims to be player obsessed but is mostly obsessed with leadership's desires
- Complete lack of support for remote employees &amp; overall camaderie
- Insane PIP/firing culture

If the office staff all had mirrors, they could look at their favorite person all day.

## Pros

Great art and option to work remotely. Great benefits. Senior Leadership fantastic at raising money from investors.

Immature passive-aggressive office staff. 5 hour-a-day overpaid workers who complain constantly. No one with any kind of management or leadership skills. You wont learn much here.

Wasted potential

## Pros

Salary, work schedule and location flexibility, part of a team of very talented artists

## Cons

A culture of toxic positivity. Feedback is entirely ignored. Task priorities changing on a daily basis. The least productive company I've ever been a part of. Employees would regularly spend weeks redoing tasks and parts of the game because of management feedback. It felt very demotivating to see how little was accomplished over the course of my employment.

## Advice to management

Trust the experts that you have hired. Be more transparent. 


# 5 stars by [Technical Artist on 2024-04-16](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Singularity-6-RVW86375944.htm)

Amazing environment and space to grow

## Pros

Working at S6 was like a dream. The entire team was fantastic, the content we made was fun to work on, and there was a lot of room for personal growth. 

The technical challenges were always fruitful and we learned as we resolved them. S6 truly feels like being part of a family. Everyone works together. The seniors/leads are very kind and patient in explaining technicalities and they make sure you understand the reason for things to work the way they do. 

If you want to learn and grow in your discipline, S6 is the place to do it. Not to mention you'll get to work on some amazing content!

The best part of it all, in my opinion, is the team dynamics. Being a skilled professional is important, but couple that with a great personality and you have the perfect colleagues. I did not meet a single employee at S6 that did not fit this bill.

## Cons

There's very little I could complain about when it comes to S6... if anything, I would say that sometimes the scoping for deliverables and random pivoting sometimes makes it a little hard to focus on personal technical growth. Such is the nature of startups, though.

## Advice to management

As rare as it is, S6 management is actually packed with amazing individuals who truly care about their employees and, more importantly, the players.

However, one piece of advice I could give management and leadership is to truly listen to some of the player feedback. Although all the goals and ideas are targeted for the players, there are some aspects of Palia that management has refused to change in order to conform to player requests; mainly achievement based gameplay. If you play the game, this will make sense.


# 1 stars by [People Operations Manager on 2024-06-17](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Singularity-6-RVW88318933.htm)

Know what you are getting into

## Pros

The line staff and people were great.

## Cons

Management is unwilling to listen to facts and doubles down on already failed strategies instead of changing. The company is not making enough revenue to cover operating cost.

## Advice to management

Look at root issues and go from there. The folks failing the company know who they are and should hire professionals to fill the roles that themselves lack experience in running successfully

## News Summary
# Singularity 6 Company Overview

## Company Background
Singularity 6 is a game development studio founded in 2018 by veterans from Riot Games. The studio is best known for its cozy MMO, **Palia**, which emphasizes community and social interaction in a high-fantasy setting. The game was initially released in open beta in August 2023 and has since expanded to multiple platforms, including the Nintendo Switch and Steam.

## Key Personnel
- **Anthony Leung**: Co-founder and CEO
- **Aidan Karabiach**: Co-founder and Game Director

## Recent Developments

### Acquisitions
- **Acquired by Daybreak Game Company**: On July 2, 2024, Singularity 6 was acquired by Daybreak Games, a subsidiary of Enad Global 7. The acquisition aims to leverage Daybreak's resources to enhance the development of Palia and expand its reach across multiple platforms ([GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/daybreak-acquires-singularity-6)).

### Fundraising
- **Initial Funding**: In 2019, Singularity 6 raised $16.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz to support the development of Palia ([PCGamesInsider](https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/74555/daybreak-acquires-palia-maker-singularity-6/)).

### Layoffs
- **Staff Reductions**: The company has faced significant layoffs, with approximately 49 employees (about one-third of the workforce) laid off in April 2024, followed by another round affecting 36 employees in May 2024. These layoffs were part of a restructuring effort to ensure long-term stability and quality of service for Palia ([PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/), [GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cozy-mmo-palia-seemingly-on-the-rocks-after-studio-goes-through-a-third-round-of-layoffs-this-time-affecting-40-of-staff/)).

## Product Development
### Palia
- **Game Features**: Palia is a free-to-play MMO that combines elements of farming, crafting, and social interaction. It has been praised for its cozy atmosphere but criticized for slow progression and bugs. The game currently holds a "Mixed" rating on Steam, with over 7,000 user reviews ([Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2024/7/17/24199912/palia-favorite-cozy-game-mmo)).
- **Player Base**: As of June 2024, Palia has attracted over 4 million players, with around 100,000 daily active users ([Enad Global 7](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/daybreak-acquires-singularity-6)).
- **Updates and Events**: The game has received regular updates, including new features and events, such as the return of the Hotpot minigame and various gameplay enhancements ([Destructoid](https://www.destructoid.com/palia-dev-update-reveals-new-tool-skins-building-upgrades-and-the-return-of-hotpot-coming-soon/)).

## Partnerships
- **Platform Expansion**: Following its acquisition, Singularity 6 plans to utilize Daybreak's resources to bring Palia to additional platforms, including a potential PlayStation release ([PSU](https://www.psu.com/news/daybreak-has-acquired-palia-studio-singularity-6/)).

## Financial Overview
- **Budget and Revenue**: Palia was developed with a budget exceeding $40 million, and while it has a respectable player base, it has not yet been deemed a financial success ([TechRaptor](https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition)).

## Community and Reception
- **Player Community**: Palia has been noted for fostering a positive community atmosphere, with players engaging in cooperative activities and social events ([Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2024/7/17/24199912/palia-favorite-cozy-game-mmo)).
- **Criticism**: Despite its community focus, the game has faced criticism for bugs and a lack of clarity regarding its development status, as it is still in beta but not labeled as Early Access on Steam ([PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/palia-studio-singularity-6-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/)).

## Conclusion
Singularity 6 is navigating a challenging landscape marked by significant layoffs and a recent acquisition by Daybreak Games. However, with a dedicated player base and ongoing updates to Palia, the studio aims to solidify its position in the gaming industry and expand its offerings across multiple platforms.
