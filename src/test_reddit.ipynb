      "**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I'm going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I'm not compensated or connected to the website I'm discussing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So like a lot of people on here I'm usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it's underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I've got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I'd run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn't been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn't, it's weird.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was fucked.  Can't sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can't afford the $100+ for a doctor's appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there's a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It's $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I'm drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I'm still in bad shape tomorrow morning it's worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guys, it was amazing.  It's not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I'd already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn't help.  She was so kind, and didn't make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor's appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it's faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can't prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I'd taken in the past wasn't an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What's the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it's what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you'll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can't estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "This amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I'll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn't shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that's a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It's not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it's a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I'd love to hear it.\n",

      "So there are prescriptions, and there are controlled substances which are like super duper extra prescriptions.  Controlled substances are usually stuff with a high chance of being abused, or that is sold as street drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prescription is for stuff like \"the pill\" or prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Controlled substances are prescription drugs with extra levels of protection and oversight.  The biggies are opiates (Percocet, Oxycontin, etc), stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall), and benzodiazepines (Valium, Klonopin).  Even IRL doctors have to do extra stuff to prescribe controlled substances, and you have to sign and do extra stuff to fill the prescriptions and pick them up at the pharmacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the 98point6 doctor could prescribe me the long-acting prescription anti-inflammatory meloxicam, but not the controlled substance Vicodin or the muscle relaxant Flexiril.  Neither medication can be purchased without a prescription from a doctor, but Vicodin is super extra hard to get prescribed.\n",

      "EDIT: I tried to clarify the original post to make it more obvious that although she couldn't prescribe the thing I'd taken in the past, she did prescribe a thing that helped a lot.  It actually helped even more than the thing I'd taken in the past and without making me drowsy, which is AWESOME!\n",
