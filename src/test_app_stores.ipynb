There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. \\r\\n1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\\r\\n2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\\r\\n3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\\r\\n4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\\r\\n5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\\r\\n6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \\r\\n7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \\r\\n8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \\r\\n9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \\r\\n10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\\r\\n11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\\r\\n12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\\r\\n13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \\r\\n14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \\r\\n15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \\r\\n16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\\r\\n17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\\r\\n18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \\r\\n19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\\r\\n20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\\r\\n21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721799278, timestamp_updated=1721799278, voted_up=True, votes_funny=20, votes_up=393, weighted_vote_score=0.8530641198158264, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.\\n\\nHowever, the game also has plenty of problems.\\n- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.\\n- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.\\n- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.\\n- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.\\n- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.\\n\\nMy recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722546795, timestamp_updated=1722547037, voted_up=False, votes_funny=6, votes_up=142, weighted_vote_score=0.8300515413284302, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \\nThere are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They\\'re okay. It\\'s not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn\\'t hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn\\'t hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don\\'t hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don\\'t make it very exciting to play. \\n\\nIt\\'s an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn\\'t bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \\n\\nFor a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don\\'t feel inviting at all. I can\\'t be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn\\'t well designed. \\n\\nI have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn\\'t enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It\\'s just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don\\'t change, I don\\'t recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \\n\\nAgain, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you\\'re making a game and when you\\'re designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it\\'s just not quite enough. So far, Palia isn\\'t more than a good base for a game.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1723409401, timestamp_updated=1723409401, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=3, weighted_vote_score=0.5454545617103577, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.\\n\\nThe gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.\\n\\nDespite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.\\n\\nThe game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\\n\\nWhile Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.\\n\\nPalia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using \"Palia Coins.\" Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I\\'ve spent upwards of $150.\\n\\nAn easy way to earn gold coins in the game is through cake/cooking parties. However, these sessions can become monotonous, requiring long periods of repetitive button and mouse clicking, which can detract from the overall enjoyment.\\n\\nPalia lays the groundwork for a charming and engaging community simulation game but is held back by technical issues, repetitive content, and limited social interactions. The game may appeal to players looking for a relaxing, casual experience, but it could benefit from more content, expanded customization options, and improved social features to maintain long-term interest.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722325911, timestamp_updated=1722325911, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score=0.5275590419769287, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

To me it seems like a combination of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing but with interactions between players.  The graphics are really nice and the game play seems fairly intuitive. I haven't had any connection issues or anything like that, but I also don't have any friends that are playing this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite not knowing anyone in the game, People seem to be willing to help out.  I love that everyone is so nice and accommodating. There is a quest were you have to fulfill another player's request, if there isn't any up, players are usually willing to put up some easy requests for you so that you can complete that quest. Furthermore, if you're missing a pretty common ingredient, for say cooking or furniture building, players are pretty good at filling those requests. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have gotten far enough in the game that I can now get some of the higher quality and rarer ingredients, and I love that players use the flares and call out in chat where those rarer ingredients are on the map.  It is so helpful and I love the way it makes you feel immersed into the game, like you really are apart of this community. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am so impressed that I have played over thirty hours of game play and haven't really felt the need to pay for anything, so far. Everything in the store seems to be mostly cosmetic, that being said, I still plan on getting something small, just because some of the cosmetic Items are cute, especially the pets. For those who don't want to spend anything, I still think that you can enjoy the game without paying anything, which is always awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read complaints about how slow the progression is, I don't feel that the game is slow in progressing at all.  I think the pacing of the game is very well done, especially for a crafting/farming mmo, to me the slower progress seems intentional so that players don't feel like they have done everything that there is to do in just a week of playing.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721670570, timestamp_updated=1721670570, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score=0.523809552192688, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

I decided to get two outfits yesterday upon one i really liked being released and they put the outfit in game and set it at 1700 in game coins which is ... A lot for a person of below average income but i said oh well it will make me happy BECAUSE  the game makes me happy and so i bit the bullet... Only to feel like a complete  FOOL when not even a few hours later they cut the prices down on the two outfits i bought full price IN LITERAL HALF just after i bought them for double the price. without ZERO NOTICE or NEWS ALERT... Feeling literally scammed out of my money THAT i could have literally stretched and gotten more out of and quite frankly like i just got ripped off considering they gave ZERO news alerts about the outfits being reduced in price AND ETC... but hey i guess they were dirty like that and most likely did it on purpose... im sure theres more folks like me feeling absolutely blind-sighted by the price-drop they did shortly after releasing it at a high one....like its absolutely ridiculous.... Literally any player who would have known would have waited to get it for half the price the same day it was released OBVIOUSLY but noooo. They gave ZERO NOTICE nor NEWS ALERTS IN GAME about this pricedrop ...ONLY ABOUT IT BEING RELEASED.... money grabbed players upon its immediate release at 1700 ... oh and the other outfit i got they cut down from 1275 to 678 or something just for even more collateral damage to my feelings of the purchases i regret more then anything now. \\n\\nIt wouldnt have even bothered me if they atleast gave notice or immediatly released the outfits at the cutdown price. Its the principal of the matter and their antic  that literally TURNED ME STRAIGHT OFF from even wanting to play the game after feeling scammed like im sure others who did the same thing i did feel... the only thing that would make me feel better about it is if they corrected the wrong doing and made me feel whole which i have yet to hear back about after foling a ticket. Like that antic literally just costed them a consumer that was happy to support the game in the future with upcoming packs and etc.... Aint no way ill ever spend another penny on this game again just for the rug-pull of a move they did with the new outfit releast today. Nope. Thats hurtful to your customers. I dont get why they would even do that....\\n\\nsmh ... Disappointed is an understatement for what they did. I get its a free game but i cant believe this game doing this to the ones that DO support them ?\\n\\nThey literally ....\\n\\nReleased New out fit at double the price and then dropped it to half in not even a few hours.... YEAH I FEEL BAD FOR US PLAYERS WHO GOT PLAYED... good job????! like all u guys did was hurt the people who support you by doing that to not one but two of the outfits.... not nice.... Had it been made aware in game via the news alerts i wouldnt even be mad and take that L but yeah...

ALL cosmetic items such as clothing and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color schemes as well. pets are also purchased with real money. i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money (seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn\\'t tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely). but i am not willing to shell out $20+, that being on the LOW end of the price ranges, on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what\\'s been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics. just because fortnite does it, doesn\\'t mean you should! i exited and uninstalled palia due to my disappointment the moment i figured out you cannot obtain cosmetics or pets without paying a stupid amount of money. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this, and i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that\\'s supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\\n\\ntldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don\\'t want to open your wallet, because ALL cosmetic items are paid for with real money and are very expensive, and this includes pets. there are no pets that do not cost real money, and a limited number of boring clothes in the character creator. the lack of pets and cosmetics is a huge blow to the game and as such there is not much to work toward, since there is not that much to do and not many players around. the character customization is extremely lacking and one of the worst i have seen. if you want to play anyway i\\'d still be wary about spending real money if i were you, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \\n\\nwho knows. with any luck, maybe this will turn into something better at some point in its future, if it has one.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722829071, timestamp_updated=1722904709, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=6, weighted_vote_score=0.5106940865516663, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

I find many aspects similar to Stardew Valley, but as a third-person RPG? The quests are interesting and there's lots to do. Great for ADHD, if you're prepared to sit down and play a game for hours haha. There are still some glitches, of course, it's the beta version. But to be honest, lots of games release their full versions in worse condition. This game being free is a STEAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the devs and new players, here are some of the glitches I've noticed:\\r\\n- Immediately after closing your inventory or tool selection, you can walk left and right but not forward. This becomes a bit inconvenient when you've chopped down a tree and are trying to switch to your bow. \\r\\n- The game sometimes crashes or the server disconnects (occasionally this is just on my end due to unstable wifi). When this happens, the tutorials are occasionally reset. Turning off tutorials would solve this problem, however, as there is often new content to see/unlock, tutorials are helpful throughout the course of the playthrough (at least where I'm at 30 hours in). So I'd prefer to honestly just click through the tutorials again rather than turn them off, but now I've had to do this 3-4 times. This has happened to my mom as well.\\r\\n- When closing the game, I have to force close it through Steam, which I've noticed when restarting it. It doesn't close despite clicking exit game. It doesn't show up on my hot bar, but steam still says that it's running. This might be an issue on Steams end.\\r\\n- My fish/bug collection broke :(. You can add prize fish and bugs to your plot to display. I guess I added too many, and now only some of my display cases actually show the bug/fish. The rest show the checkered textureless pattern instead. I'm not sure which setting I'd need to turn on to fix that. My fish/bug display was my favourite part of my plot but now it's a bit of a graveyard with only some fish visible among their bretheren, \\r\\n- This is something that is honestly hard to run into so I doubt it will be an issue for most people: if you get kicked out of the game or it crashes outside of the housing plots, where you receive the welcome message from the developers, don't open your inventory. I triggered my inventory tutorial, which asked me to click on something on the screen, but the welcome message from the dev team popped up at the same time. I couldn't interact with either, so had to force shutdown the game. Great way to get stuck, but also a bit funny. Again, probably not likely to happen, but a fun bit of misfortune to share haha.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last suggestion, but when I first started playing I didn't realise I'd be receiving mail from the villagers. Most games have mailboxes as a way to receive update newsletters and messages from the dev team. There's also just so much to check out the mail box was ignored for a bit too long. I know the tutorial mentions that Auni brings the mail every morning, but maybe mentioning in the tutorial that new mail will come in as your relationships with the villagers increases, or having checking the mailbox as a quest objective would help. I know my mom had the same issue where she was struggling with a quest because she didn't know to check the mail box. Now I check it all the time, I love the function! I really love the characters you can meet and interact with in this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nI might come back and review it again once I get farther into the quest lines. So far I'm enjoying it. My mom also plays and she's been enjoying it a lot. I think the characters and relationship developments are my favourite part of the game so far.

I don't want to over generalize the things that were done differently in this game, but I fail to see much variation from games like Paleo Pines and My Time in Portia when you have an open world where most of your time is spent running around rather than doing tasks and farming resources. \\n\\nI don't like having to wait 30 real minutes to have materials needed to progress finish crafting, as well as the rng aspect of how many resources you get from a node, or where the node spawns. Usually you bet on having the nodes in a consistent area but it's quite honestly random. Also with the servers joining and kicking you randomly, the nodes keep disipearing and respawning somewhere else instead of the same general area. Its kind of annoying to have the entire world lose collision and having to wait until I can fast travel home because I fell thru the map. Its really annoying that upgrades to your tools are not permanent. \\nAnd you have to repair them using repair kits, which are cheaper than crafting them fresh, but honestly its an aspect of gameplay that slogs the game down with how tedious already resource gathering already is. \\n\\nRealistically, do you expect people to play the game until they are level 10 in all skills? That doesn't sound fun. A lot of these types of games aren't fun and quickly lose my interest because of it. It's like how clash of clans makes you weight longer and longer with each upgrade. The cost of resources and the time it takes to craft is genuinely some of the most annoying things ever. \\n\\nHaving the fishing mechanic of Far Cry 5 is interesting especially since you still insist on having the Animal Crossing, wait 3 times before you snag a fish. Especially when you can time your snag so you dont have to wait 3 times in animal crossing. Fishing is boring. I hate it. I especially hate having to stop harvesting resources to go repair my tool. The fast travel is a joke. You either pay to travel, or have to wait for the free one which is 15-30 minutes with each use. It honestly seems arbitrary. Why make the player wait? Your gameplay is limited by time. You cannot progress time for it is on a server. You are forced to wait for specific windows to carry out tasks. Why add even more to that with the arbitrary wait time for crafting resources. It makes little sense. You lock the player in an animation for some, you have automatic crafting for others, you don't need fuel, resources are inconsistently spotted around the playing area. \\n\\nIt convalutes a straight forward loop for no other reason to keep you playing for as long as possible. If you could go to designated areas to grind for the resources you need, the game would be easy. They need you to run around, deload and reload areas in order to respawn or despawn nodes in order to roll the dice that it spawns an iron node and hoping you get 4 ore instead of 3 or 2. It's obnoxious. Why even have the BOTW climb mechanic and paraglider? You can'y climb anything that isn't very specific terrain. \\n\\nWhy even have a stamina meter for climbing if you can sprint indefinitely? \\nNot a very ambitious title. Not the worst game in this genre. Not much incentive to play often. \\nAdding daily rewards seems up their alley.

(multiplayer wasn\\'t a Huge feature for me tho tbh, other than ppl helping with flow trees or calling out rare resources in chat).\\n\\npalia is a vibrant alien setting where you play a human who\\'s suddenly magically spawned here and has to make a living and find their place in this new world. there are two main maps currently: kilima valley -which has mountains, rivers, and meadows- and bahari bay -which is mostly mountains, beaches, and shores- (and each one has lots of nooks and crannies for you to explore). there\\'s two species you meet, majiri (humanoid-looking aliens(?) of varying colorful skintones), and grimalkin (furry anthro cat-looking species). and there\\'s also some droid/robot people here too called Gaulders, whose makers seem to be long gone. there\\'s some fascinating lore you figure out through exploring and completing mainline quests that reveals a hidden depth to this deceptively cheerful/carefree, colorful world and hints at a dark catastrophe that happened a long time ago. plot-wise, i find the story intriguing and i\\'m excited to see this content updated in the future because it currently isn\\'t completed. \\n\\ni find that palia\\'s cast of characters is wonderful too. each character is unique and like all sims, they have their likes and dislikes, their own routines and places/people they tend to hang out with. they all have really fantastic designs, voice actors (not every line is voiced), and are all distinguished characters with clear personalities. a fascinating mechanism that i have not seen before that\\'s implemented here is a refreshing take on the regular gifting mechanic. similar to other sims, you gift villagers to befriend them, BUT the player must actually TALK to the villagers OR the people around them to figure out what they\\'d like. each villager can only be gifted one item per real life day and they also have a wanted-items list that refreshes each week, in addition to their respective normal individual liked-items lists (in case you can\\'t get their weekly wants but still want to improve your friendship with gifts). the more your friendship levels up with a character, the more specific weekly-want items they will ask of you. this system incentivizes the player to talk daily with the characters to figure out what gifts they OR other characters may want and allows the player to organically befriend the villager and understand the relationships they may have with other villagers. it\\'s such a simple change to have, where you occasionally have to talk to Other villagers in order to get to know another villager better, but it helps with the immersion. like of course it makes sense that one character would mention something her brother likes, or another character will tell you what his mother needs this week. increasing villager friendship and doing other activities leads you to gain renown, which you can use to buy more land on your property, licenses to have more appliances, and some home decorations.\\n\\nwhat do you do in the game? well you\\'ve got the typical life sim stuff: mining, foraging, cooking, and fishing. but palia also has hunting, furniture-making, and bug-catching (which is basically pokemon LOL, throw balls at it until it\\'s caught). aside from functional skills and activities, there is also cosmetic decorating which is very fun!! the current system for the functional skills is pretty straightforward: do the activity, collect the resource, earn exp to level up. and the more you level up, the more you have access to higher level tools in each of the respective skills. (there is also a mechanism where eating food isn\\'t for energy that limits what you can do everyday, but for a \"focus bar\" that increases the Amount of exp you get from doing these activities. you can still earn exp without the focus bar. but you can use renown to level up your focus bar to boost your exp gain and also increase the length of the focus bar as well). each of these activities is also tied to a character in the game, so there is greater immersion in getting better at these skills and learning from the characters who are more experienced than you at the start. eventually you will reach level 10 where you can join the respective skill guilds and have access to each related skills currency to purchase guild-specific items (ingredients, materials, one-use tools, various decorations for your house). there\\'s a Lot to do in palia lol.\\n\\ni think aside from the story, characters, and typical activities, the biggest draw for people to palia must be the decorating. palia has a fantastic decorating system with a MULTITUDE of furniture options and aesthetics you can mix and match. of course the player can buy these at the in-game furniture shop with in-game currency, but it is much cheaper to level up your furniture-making skill, gain the materials, and do it yourself. the game has two main places to buy furniture: the furniture shop run by Tish and also Zeki\\'s underground gambling ring. all the villagers tied to skills also have some related decorations available for purchase with money and guild tokens too. anyway, you can really go in-depth with decorating in this game. furniture with open-able parts actually let you put things in them (ie cabinets), furniture with light can actually be turned on and off, seats can be sat on, and bookshelves can actually be decorated with books! from plushies, to beds, to dishware, sofas, counters, and so on - there\\'s just so much that palia\\'s decorating has to offer someone. there\\'s even furniture modification kits too, which i haven\\'t figured out yet bc i don\\'t go too deep into decorating, but i\\'m sure it adds to the customization factor. if you enjoy decorating your home in the sims, you will LOVE decorating in palia. you can also decorate Outside the house as well, changing your roof type and color, painting the walls outside and even the foundation. most furniture you can also place outside too, since palia offers outdoor furniture and structures to make your plot more homey. there\\'s also house tours, where you can look at other player\\'s homes if you wish! palia, unlike most other life sims, also lets you change the layout of your house, choosing which rooms go where, what size rooms they are, what type of doorway each room has (no closed doors though). these additional rooms and structures can be earned through making furniture, being gifted by tish when you level up in furniture-making, and purchasing them from the town hall using in-game money or renown. palia also lets you decorate the outside of your home with flowers, trees, and other plants grown through seeds you get from bug collecting and foraging. speaking of which, you can also decorate your home with star-level bugs, food you make, fish, and other star-level materials. palia really lets you go ham with decorating if you are into that and i love it. \\n\\nall this said, the only major complaint i have is searching for rare materials lol. i don\\'t mind them being hard to find in general because that\\'s what \"rare\" means, but there was a quest where i needed a ruby and i was farming for HOURS IRL for like 4 DAYS STRAIGHT. i just beg the devs: if the item\\'s needed for a quest, PLEASE INCREASE THE DROP RATE FOR THE PLAYER UNTIL THEY GET ONE. i was legit running on fumes trying to find a ruby and mining everything piece of palium ore i could find.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722381436, timestamp_updated=1722381436, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=0, weighted_vote_score=0.0, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

Whether you’re making new friends in the village or meeting mysterious characters on your adventures, everything looks and feels amazing.\\n\\nBut Palia isn’t just about looking good. The storyline is really well-written and hooks you right from the beginning. The world is rich with lore and history, and every quest feels like a piece of a larger puzzle that you’re dying to solve. The dialogue is engaging and adds depth to the characters, making every interaction feel meaningful. You quickly find yourself invested in their stories and the fate of the world around you.\\n\\nOne of the coolest things about Palia is how your choices matter. The world changes based on what you do, making the story feel personal and dynamic. This level of interactivity adds a lot of depth to the game and makes you feel like you’re truly part of the story. The quests are varied and interesting, keeping things fresh and exciting. Whether you’re solving puzzles, building relationships, or going on epic adventures, there’s always something new to discover.\\n\\nThat said, be ready for a fair amount of grinding for materials and items. This might not be everyone’s cup of tea, as gathering resources can be a bit time-consuming. But if you enjoy a more relaxed pace and the satisfaction of crafting and building, this can be really rewarding. The grind can become a chill process, giving you time to appreciate the beauty of the world and the intricacies of the game’s systems.\\n\\nAll in all, Palia is a game that nails both the visuals and the story.

Leaving you to explore and gather various items as you start out. Fishing being the only non-restrictive tool/function. You may catch any fish from anywhere in the map with any rod, it just may be more challenging. \\n\\nThe MULTIPLAYER feature is convoluted with no explanation, guide or information on how to play with friends. To even get the multiplayer window you have to hit \"O\" and add your friends, there is no direct invite or join through steam.

Once you get more people in a small area, lag. Hunting/gathering objects frequently disappear underground never to be seen again. Loot sometimes is unlootable which if you spent time going after a strong target solo can be frustrating. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, really poor in game connectivity. It is hard to get groups going and group play is how the game is really designed to be played. Solo play is fine but if you are hunting an target that is in a tree, you need to cut the tree down, switch weapon and then try and shoot it and with the current system, that could take a few seconds and by then, its already beyond the next hill and climbing another tree. Then if its an enemy that can turn invisible, well, it may turn invisible and by the time the new invisible animation appears, its too far to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nGame mechanics like fishing, well, you can get fish that are docile as well as those that fight to a point it is impossible to reel in, not breed or anything, just feels very random if they will dart left to right or hop out of the water making fishing inconsistent. On top of that, you can gain a 50% decrease in waiting by fishing near somebody and with the bonus of grouping up, the different between solo play and grouped up is pretty insane. Increased yield and decreased time just by grouping up but in game, its hard to get anybody to group up. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a long story but it isn't helped by walls of text to convey things that really aren't that interesting, the more I play, the less inclined I am to read any of it and just click through everything. I think this is one of those games that could benefit from some good in game clips and voice narration for at least the main quest chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real redeeming quality is the building of your own personal plot but the problem with that is the price tag. Making it slow and painful to do but people still do it and it is still fun to go through.

Adore. This game.\\r\\n\\r\\n[b] tl;dr beautiful cozy game with a huge strength in decorating. enjoyable but somewhat limited story, but sooo much content if you enjoy building and decorating. [/b]\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been playing Palia for almost a year now (idk how many hundreds of hours I have logged from before it came to Steam), and that in itself is a huge positive review because I tend to drop games after a month or two of heavy play and find something new to move onto. So the fact that I've stuck around without taking a break for more than a week or two at a time speaks volumes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis game's vibes are immaculate—very cozy and pretty, tranquil good times. There are a lot of mechanics that encourage people to work together, so I'd definitely say it's better with friends. If you don't have any friends who play it (yet hehe), though, fret not! The community tends to be very friendly, and I've made *many* friends with people I've encountered out and about. You also can get by just fine on your own, if you prefer that! I usually get bored with a grind, but I actually really enjoy it in this game. There's lots to do running around out in the world, and you always have all of the tools you need with you, so you can kinda do anything and everything all the time, which feels very satisfying. It's a pleasure to get distracted and sidetracked while gathering resources, and even better with friends!\\r\\n\\r\\nPalia's very biggest strength, in my opinion, is the decorating! I cannot get enough. They give you SO many tools to do what you want. Something not fitting very well while snapping to the grid? No problem! Just toggle the grid off in free placement mode. Tired of your house and feel like starting over, but don't want to lose all the work you've done? Easy peasy! Just leave it as is and open up a brand new plot to start from scratch! It is really mind-blowing how much you have to work with, and they're very regularly adding new furniture lines. There's also lots you can do if you think outside the box, and it's a [i] delightful [/i] scratching of the creative itch. I'm always finding new projects to work on, and the new content added periodically keeps me coming up with more and more ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will give a couple of caveats:\\r\\nI think many of the people leaving negative reviews and saying there isn't anything to do in the game just must not enjoy decorating. There is some enjoyable story and fun characters, but the game is in Beta and the story content isn't super long. If that's all you're here for, you might not last long. But there is [i] so [/i] much content at our disposal for decorating, and that's where I find the most fulfillment in this game.\\r\\nAlso, Palia is in Beta. It definitely has a number of issues and bugs. New issues do often come up as new patches are deployed. But the devs address these issues as quickly as they can, and they're usually very on top of handling the more major and disruptive bugs fast. These things can be frustrating at times, but it's early access and free game, so I try to stay patient because I know S6 is working as hard as they can to improve the experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly recommend this game! I think, at the very least, it's worth a download to see if it's your cup of tea—it's free, after all! I've had so many good times here, and I've built a really lovely, close-knit community because of this game, which I'll always be grateful for.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722322585, timestamp_updated=1722322585, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=0, weighted_vote_score=0.0, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

Everything, aside from some story-quest instanced areas, is a shared where all activities can be shared with others, and you\\'re actively encouraged to do so. There\\'s mechanics in place to allow un-partied players to cooperate with each other, while partied players have a small chance to duplicate their resources while near each other. The most commons mechanics for this are: 1. that if you ever \"tag\" a resource once, no matter where you are on the map, when it\\'s finally harvested, you get full credit and loot, and 2. if someone harvests some resources, these resources continue to exist for others from 3 minutes, the same length of time as the completely optional, and cheap to make, flare you can launch. This has fostered a community that actively calls out where on the map rare resources are and flares them, despite the players not actively gaining anything for doing so; good manners leads to good manners, and helping others leads to others helping as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game itself feels a bit like other cozy-casual games like stardew valley, from all the various resource gathering skills, and your interactions with the villagers, and your ability to even romance several of them (or all of them). There\\'s a day-night cycle of 1-hour to 24-hours, split into 4 parts of an entire day, with different resources and events available at different times. There\\'s also a heavy focus on exploration and platforming, including a BotW-style gliding and climbing system. You can spend dozens of hours in some areas, and still find new hidden loot that is sometimes just hiding in plain sight. There\\'s even an only-up-style climbing section with its own record keeping and rewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of steam achievements, most of them aren\\'t too difficult, with only a couple taking absurd lengths of times to complete due to the RNG involved. There\\'s even more in-game achievements, called accomplishments, than there are steam achievements, so the developers had the opportunity to make even more absurd steam achievements, but actively chose not to, so kudos to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, the game is also heavily inundated with bugs and issues. This is a social-heavy game, but the social elements only work half the time. While the movement experience is almost entirely smooth for yourself, with no teleporting from lag, sometimes you just wont grip a climbable object. Other players are often teleporting or appear to be under the world. Moving objects and creatures will often teleport due to other players interacting with them, and the server syncing you to their cycle instead. Finally, the party system is completely broken: half the time people just don\\'t get your invite, sometimes when accepted, it doesn\\'t show you in the party when you are, sometimes while in a party, the game tells you that you left, but you\\'re still in the party, and even when you actually leave a party, the party will continue to exist for a short while anyways. There\\'s even ways to partially softlock your quest progress, since your quest inventory has a limit, but you can at times get as many of some quest items as you like, but thankfully you can store quest items in your storage without limits, so you can work around this issues that shouldn\\'t have been an issue in the first place.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722210576, timestamp_updated=1722210576, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=0, weighted_vote_score=0.0, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

It is ok if you love playing with decorations and setting up a dream house. Or you want to liquify your brain for a little while. But overall the game is secondary, does not bring much novelty and needs work. Recomended only for those who are really into that artistic and self expression stuff in games.\\n\\n\\nAfter 80 hrs in the game, I think I personally would not recommend myself to start playing it, if put 80 hrs of game time back. Not that I did not enjoy it, I had quite a bit of fun for some time, but then the negatives kicked in. I chose \"yes\" for recommendations since there are certanly people who are or will enjoy it. And if the game is developed further, it can actually become a great game, but it is not there yet. \\n\\nPositives.\\n1) This game is relaxing and chill. The exact thing I needed for my vacation. You know that none of your actions can harm your progress or any relation with the villagers. This game is indeed cozy. You can turn off your brain and go with the flow without any thought. Good escapism tool.\\n2) The graphics seem nice if a bit generic. \\n3) The Galdurs (robots) are adorable. \\n4) It\\'s free. There is no pay to win monetization which is great and developers must be applauded for that. \\n5) Although, it is advertized as a preferably multyplayer game, you don\\'t actually have to have a party to fullfill any quest of receipe. You can experience the whole game solo.\\n6) It is actually quite interesting and enjoyable to see how each character in the village evolves, how these little dialogues or monologues are changing in course of the game.\\n7) The cooking is fun.\\n8) And generally the storyline and the discovery aspect of the game are quite engaging and fun.\\n\\nNegatives.\\n1) This is indeed a 3d Stardew valley. Meaning the experience is quite familiar and not novel at all. Basically all the mechanics are similar or entirelly the same: you gain a plot of land, first you need to clear it of junk, you buy seeds and start farming, you aquire receipes for furniture and decorations for the house, you meet villagers and give them gifts on a regular basis to achieve certain level of relation, and the preferences for items are unique for each villager. You fish for different types of fish in different locations, at different daytime and with different bait, etc.\\n2) There is a lot of grind. Not the asian level of grind but still. Most of the quests are very similar and become boring.\\n3) The emphasis on the building and decoration worked for me only that long. Problem with the decorations and furniture is that it is not functional. For the kitchen - Yes, it is interesting and fun to decorate and improve it so it becomes beautiful AND more convenient and functional. The rest of the house: not so much. Obviously, there are people who can enjoy this artistic aspect of the game much more, but for me the questline and learning the plot is more important, while the decorative part is a nice extra on the side.\\n4) The game appeared to be not exactly what I expected from the initial announcements and trailers. It was sold with the idea of \"build something together\". And I imagined that players would obtain plots of land and build houses in a COMMON space, so you could see a settlement grow, see what everyone does with the decorations and fulfill certain roles in the community, If not globally, at least within the group. Of course my expectations are my problem, especially it is silly to complain since the game is free. But in my eyes the way the game was \"sold\" to the audience and the result are quite a bit different, and this is certainly not what I expected and wanted. Imagine Valheim, with its freedom of building, where you and you friends can really build something together. That is what I was imagining before I played the game. The instanced secluded plot of land cetanly feels empty, lonely. disconnected and ruins the feelling of being a part of the community, which the game apparently was intended to provide.\\n5) Why on earth you cannot sell furniture??? You can sell forage, game, bugs, metals, crops and food, but not furniture? Which you foraged materials for, produced and do not need so much of? That is beyond my comprehension.\\n6) Limit of 9 3x3 farming plots is annoying and feels artificially imposed to limit the pacing without any explanation lorewise.\\n7) Connection of certain mechanics to the real world time (growing crops, delays between giving presents, etc.) reeks of mobile gaming and again artificial boundries to limit the pacing.\\n6) The story is not finished and it is uncertain whether it will be. The feelling of being hooked to the plot with no answers and the ending really cut it for me. The cliff hanger situation is annoying. There is very little replayability for me.\\n\\nOverall, I would say the game is Ok, but not great. I had some fun, but I\\'d rather spend these 80 hrs on something more worthy.

No need to run to 8 different chests to find something.\\n- How \\'alive\\' the world is (not talking about multiplayer). We can randomly pick up a quest item and that feels more organic.\\n- House editing. The top-down view is very convenient and I like how we can customise our house layout. Wish the fireplace didn\\'t take up an entire wall though. Also hope we are able to stack rooms in the future since we have a 2nd floor with that bigger Harvest house.\\n- Art style.\\n\\nWhat I hope improves:\\n- Farming is quite slow, hope we get some upgrades that let us automate it a bit.\\n- Storage needs more filters, especially for our furniture.\\n- More interactions with villagers!\\n- More Community function. Maybe a community chest that we can all use to share items.\\n\\nIssues: (some might just be a \"my laptop\" issue)\\n- Lighting glitches out sometimes when the time of day changes.\\n- Animals glitch out when multiple appear out of a tree at the same time.\\n- I crash almost 80% of the time when I first boot up the game. After that it runs smoothly.\\n- Bugs (insects) sometimes clip under the floor. (not talking about them despawning)\\n- Desync issues (animals/players) especially when in a party.\\n- Hair colour bug. (primary and secondary swap places and primary doesn\\'t show up)\\n- World not loading in randomly.

The emphasis on personal and community goals means there’s less of a clear path to \"endgame\" content.\\n\\n[❌] 🧩 [B]Limited Challenge[/B]: [I]Palia[/I] is designed to be a relaxing experience, but this also means it lacks the challenge found in more traditional MMOs. Players seeking a game with difficult content or intense competition might find [I]Palia[/I] too easygoing.\\n\\n[h2]Why 8/10?[/h2]\\n\\n[I]Palia[/I] offers a refreshing take on the MMO genre with its focus on life-simulation, creativity, and community. Its charming visuals, collaborative gameplay, and relaxing atmosphere make it a standout for players seeking a more laid-back and social experience. However, its limited narrative depth, simplistic combat, and slow progression may not appeal to everyone, particularly those looking for more traditional MMO elements.

Everyone I\\'ve encountered has been helpful save for 1 or 2. You\\'ll have that in every game, but this game seems to have fewer trolls/griefers than others.\\n- Game is relatively easy to get the hang of while remaining challenging. Basic mechanics are easy to understand, but you\\'ll still need skill and practice to catch/hunt some more rare creatures\\n- So far, there are consistent updates and devs seem quite transparent about their intentions. Updates seems based on user feedback, which I\\'m pretty happy to see\\n- Characters are relatively diverse and different enough from each other. Also... kinda love that not EVERYONE has a tragic backstory. I love that we have romanceable characters who are just \"I just wanna be a farmer\" even if that\\'s not my cup of tea.\\n- Story is super promising! It had me immediately intrigued and locked in\\n\\nCons:\\n- Paid content seems a bit on the pricey side; I\\'d love for paid content to remain aesthetic only, but at a lower cost. I\\'d pay for base game and then have cheaper paid cosmetics, if that makes sense. Or perhaps ways to accumulate small amounts of premium currency, like rare achievements or something?\\n- There are only 2 adventure zones at the moment--they are pretty fleshed out, and this is still a Beta game, so this isn\\'t too much of a problem (A 3rd zone is being released early next year apparently!)\\n- This was addressed in a recent post by dev, but I\\'ll reiterate it--increase decor limit!\\n- I\\'d love to see more random treasure chests too. I love collecting them. (Not really a con, I just want hundreds of those cute little chests) Let me keep the chest from the waterlogged chest please!!!\\n- There are some characters I\\'d love to see more depth of. For instance, more story with Jina, Hekla, Elouisa, Einar, etc. I\\'m sure there are plans for more characters in new zones/future updates, so again this isn\\'t really a problem too much\\n- I WANNA GO SEE THE CITY AND SEE MORE GRIMALKIN.\\n- The STORY!!

Because that sounds like a great game. Hmmm, making it free to play, adding in micro-transactions and in-game currencies, and raking in a ton more cash then you would get from just selling the basic game.\\n\\nPersonally, I don't really see or feel the draw when playing. The charm of Harvest Moon is missing, and the scaled material gathering/production of My Time At Portia is missing. This game is a massive grind, a MASSIVE grind; with the time required to make your first basic copper bar being three minutes. They limit the number of material production buildings and make it so you need to buy permission for more, which takes time grinding other things, and on and on it goes. I am sure that this is fun for a lot of people, but I found it quickly tiresome; and this is coming from a person who enjoys scrapping space ships in Hardbreaker and cleaning up in Viscera.\\n\\nThen there is the fact that the game straight up lies to you. Single player you say? Alright. That is why I initially gave this game a shot. But there is no single player, and you cannot have a server to yourself, or your own instance. There will always be people around. People hunting the animals you need, or fishing at the spots you wanted, or collecting the ore/bugs/plants/what ever. Add on top of this the fact that in order to travel from your homestead to the main city and back, you need to wait in a queue behind other people. The servers are incredibly laggy and unstable at times. I played for nearly five hours and I don't think I went for more than a half hour without experiencing problems. There was even a time where I was bounced from server to server, one after another.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while this is free, I don't think I will keep playing. I don't feel like this type of game really works well in a multiplayer environment, and that multiplayer environment (the servers) is not given enough upkeep. If you think you will find this kind of game fun, go for it, it is free; but keep it that way. I will not be playing anymore and I don't recommend it only so that people don't get caught up in micro-transaction and in-game currency shenanigans.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722466794, timestamp_updated=1722466937, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=0, weighted_vote_score=0.0, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

This game is still in BETA, meaning it's still in it's infancy. There has already been so many fabulous updates and bug fixes, and they bring out at least 1 major update every month! Yes there are some bugs still, but be patient and be kind. They are working on ways to fix the annoying ones. This game is free! It gives you SO much content for being a free game. There's endless things to do all time. With thousands of furniture pieces/placeable objects, flowers, trees, building blocks, paths, and more, you can create your homestead any way you want and the possibilities are endless. I've been to some awesome plots where you can just tell people have spent 50 hours alone on just decorating their homes. There's 8 skills to train : Hunting, Gardening, Mining, Foraging, Cooking, Fishing, Bug catching, and Furniture making, with no level cap! There's many in game achievements that are also now steam achievements. The graphics are so beautiful on PC, just ok on Switch. This is a cross-platform (PC & Switch) Cozy MMORPG that allows you to play with your friends on either platform. There is a premium shop with plenty of fancy outfits, pets, and glider and tool skins to purchase with real money. These items can be quite costly, but it's the only way the makers are making any money off of the game. There are many NPC's, with several you can even romance! Each NPC has their own family tree and storyline. This game has a lot of quests with hopes of them bringing even more out for us late-gamers. Singularity 6 actually listens to their players feedback as well! I hope that Daybreak Games continues to make this a free game, accessible for all the play. I've told a few people that I would compare this game to a combination of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley made into an MMO. There is still so much more to come to Palia!\\n\\nI highly recommend you give Palia a chance!

The NPC character creation and backstories are incredibly well-built, and as you build your relationship with each NPC you slowly discover more about their pasts through conversation, and the details of their stories are carried through to other NPC\\'s and their homes - each NPC even has their own individual walk style!\\n\\nOverall, the game has so much potential to continue being great - for a multiplayer game, I\\'ve seen very, very few toxic players, and the game encourages working together as a community/party to farm certain resources, and actively reminds players to be nice and kind, creating an actual community within a server, which is hard to find on the internet now.\\n\\nI\\'ve sunk many, many hours into this game (and far more on their own launcher before the steam release) and if it continues on the way it has been, I will always return to it. I highly recommend this game for people who just want to relax, and enjoy games where you just spend some time levelling, collecting, or building up your homestead. One of the huge pluses for me, is that there is 0 combat or peril - there isn\\'t even a health bar or fall damage. It\\'s truly the epitome of cosy.\\n\\nFor a free game, still in early access, there\\'s nothing to lose by trying it out. I\\'ve also been impressed with the in game purchases - they\\'re not outrageously priced, and nothing you can craft is hidden behind a paywall, just various cosmetic skins.\\n\\nThere is also lots of limited time events, that run for a decent enough time for you to achieve all the goals without panicking/stressing, and give you the chance to get items that only appear during that event.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Excellent NPC character creation, backstories, and relationship building mechanics\\n+ Beautiful animation of landscapes and characters\\n+ Great range of skills to work on\\n+ Plenty of side quests and free exploration outside of main story\\n+ New things are constantly being added as it\\'s still in early access - so can only get better from here!\\n+ Lots of periodical in-game events\\n+ Good multiplayer functionality (though sometimes can be glitchy, but for an early access game, it\\'s more solid than others I\\'ve played in full release)\\n+ Good gameplay mechanics\\n+ UI is easy to use and understand\\n\\nCons:\\n- Because Palia is still in early access still, there are some bugs/glitches that pop up sometimes, that take a while to fix. Nothing makes the game unplayable though in my experience, but go into it with your eyes open knowing that it\\'s not perfect, but is solid all the same\\n- Is a small studio, so bugs do take a long time to get worked on\\n- I have concerns since Singularity 6 was bought out by Daybreak recently, that the in-game purchases could start over-reaching - currently you can buy skins and cosmetics, but if outside influence from the games original team/developers starts pushing for additional micro-purchases that hides gameplay/crafting recipes etc. behind a paywall, I would find that more frustrating (I have bought cosmetics to support the game, with the hours I\\'ve sunk into it, felt like a crime not to!)\\n- Not really a con for me, but if you only enjoy combat style games, then this game is not for you. There is no PvP, there is no battling. You won\\'t like it if you don\\'t enjoy cosy games. Hell, this has less peril than Stardew Valley!\\n\\nHave tried to be objective where I can and give an honest view of this game, but I honestly love playing this game, both solo and with friends. I love the community that has been cultivated within this game, and how it\\'s so rare to encounter the usual toxicity that I find in online gaming.

Laid Back. So Much To Do.\\n\\nAt first, I really didn't think I would like this game, but soon after starting it, it rapidly grew on me. The world that they've built here is charming, colorful, and vibrant. I struggle with anxiety on a near daily basis, and this game has become my little sanctuary haven where I can just chill out and work on little projects here and there. There is so much to do in this game (if you don't mind repetition. The game can be grindy, but for me, I like that. I like the routine). One minute I'll be arranging some furniture in a new room I've built, then I run down to the bay to get materials, but then I get distracted by some bugs, and what's that? Oh a chest! Lemme fish for a bit. Ah I can do this quest now. It's pure ADHD junk-food and I love it.  The NPCs are great as well. I loved getting to know them and slowly piecing together all the village gossip. The community is nice and helpful. And there are some neat 'mini-games' tucked away in places as well! The game isn't finished at the time of writing this, but it's free. Give it a try, you don't have much to lose.\\n\\nOh but one thing, proceed into the cosmetic store WITH CAUTION. My only real gripe with the game is how the clothing shop is built. Rather high pricing aside, you are forced to buy entire sets instead of pieces of outfits. Can be kind of lame, if all you want is a hat or a pair of boots from a set and you need to buy up the whole thing. But, its totally optional. \\n\\nIf you like farming games, home decorating, relationship building, collection amassing, treasure hunting, nature exploring, games of chance, simple questlines, and total freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want with no time limit, this game may be for you.\\n\\nNow if you'll excuse me, I think my hotpot is burning.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721652852, timestamp_updated=1721652852, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=0, weighted_vote_score=0.0, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

I was looking for something cute, relaxing, and farming-like but with more world exploration options, and this hits the spot just right. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy personal favorites:\\r\\n- Building: There\\'s so much freedom in building your home, it\\'s crazy. I love how immersive it is. You can customize your home to such tiny details as where and how you place your books. \\r\\n- Crafting: As above with building, you have tons of options and items that you can craft, and every time you craft a new item, you can learn more. Everything can be used to decorate your home/land. Or you can give them to the villagers as gifts. \\r\\n- Farming: I love that you don\\'t just click a button and everything appears or grows. You have to really FARM. The plants will grow over time and require water, and they\\'ll sometimes give you seeds. You can gather wildflowers from your world explorations and get the seeds and grow the plant on your property as well. I don\\'t know if there will be animals though. It doesn\\'t seem so. You can also buy seeds from the farmer NPC.\\r\\n- Fishing: Fishing seems straightforward enough, but it isn\\'t easy for everyone. Once I learned how to do it, I love it now. You can use fish for cooking, gifting, or even put it in a fish tank on your own property. \\r\\n- Cooking: I don\\'t have much to say about this, but I love it when you can cook in games and gather recipes. Food can be used to restore your energy or as a gift.\\r\\n- Wardrobe: You\\'re not stuck with the same looks forever. Change your clothing, hair, and accessories. The default ones are for free, but you can make an in-game purchase for cooler items, pets, and whatnot. \\r\\n- Friendships: The village has a number of NPCs, each with their own unique personality and story. They are NOT static. Each one has their own routine, the places they visit, and you see them moving around a lot. For those who love immersion, I think it\\'s perfect. They will only stay in the same place if it\\'s their \"job\" but they also get their free time and go to bed at night. Besides that, befriending different villagers gives you different perks/items/skills/etc.\\r\\n- Romance: I haven\\'t gotten this far, but I noticed that some of the NPCs have an additional icon for romance, which unlocks after you get Lvl 3 in friendship. I don\\'t know if marriage is an option, but I hope so. Oh, and the game doesn\\'t filter if you play as a female or male character.\\r\\n- Village: The village itself is very cute, with various shops and secret places that you can find. Every time I feel like I\\'ve seen everything, I still find something new, something secret.\\r\\n- Secrets: You can stumble onto books, letters, strange items, and secret places. There are tons of things to discover.\\r\\n- Player Farms: You can visit other players\\' homes and wow, they\\'re so beautiful and creative.\\r\\n- Immortality: You can\\'t die. You can run out of energy, but you won\\'t die if you fall from a cliff. Yay. Oh, and nobody attacks you. Wolves run from you and hide ON THE TREES, which I found so funny. For me, it\\'s a big plus when I want cozy games and not having to think about survival.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther things you can do that I personally feel neutral about:\\r\\n- Mining and wood chopping: You can gather the required materials all over the world. It\\'s part of immersion, but I don\\'t love it and don\\'t hate it either. \\r\\n- Hunting: I personally don\\'t like hunting when some of the animals are SO CUTE. Why would I want to kill it? The game, however, doesn\\'t seem to force it. You have quests that involve gathering meat, but I just bought it in the store without killing the cute animals (although technically it\\'s still dead? Hmm...Okay, let\\'s not question my moralities. :D). \\r\\n- Catching bugs: Same as with fishing, you can catch all sorts of bugs and use them as gifts (yes, some NPCs think it\\'s a fantastic gift), put them in your home and...okay, maybe not for cooking. But you can sell them, so you get money for those worms and whatever. Yay.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\n- Uh...I can\\'t think of any. The only thing I dislike about the existing things is hunting cute animals, but that\\'s life, so it\\'s not a problem as long as it stays optional in the game and quests have workarounds like buying the item instead of going for the kill. \\r\\n- Oh, and you can\\'t swim. There\\'s plenty of water but you get respawned nearby if you get inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:\\r\\n- The game is quite immersive for something this cozy (and free), but I feel like it would benefit from letting the player sit or interact with other items that aren\\'t on their own property. You craft a bench and put it in your house—sure, sit on it until your rear falls off. But why can\\'t I sit on a bench in the village? What if I want my rear to fall off there, not on my own property? Or if I visit the inn, why not let me sit at the table? Okay, I get why I can\\'t walk into a stranger\\'s house and empty their fridge, but why can\\'t I sit at the inn? Or read the books at the library? I mean, I don\\'t need to actually read random paragraphs, but an animation with a rising skill would be lovely, for example, if i pick up a book about fishing or something along those lines.\\r\\n- I can buy/craft a musical instrument, but I can\\'t play it. It would be fun if artistic activities were optional just as much as cooking or whatever else in the game. For example, when you complete quests or speak daily to the NPCs, you get reputation points. Playing an instrument that I\\'ve crafted could affect it. Maybe my instruments even squeak while I have a low skill and then get better over time just like crafting recipes and stuff. \\r\\n- SWIMMING!!! I don\\'t need a deep sea experience, but being respawned every time I wet my feet is quite annoying when I could just swim over. I understand that this might serve a purpose of not letting me near a place that\\'s supposed to be hard to get to, but I think other obstacles would have been better. You gave us so many nice places and the game is cozy, why not let some players swim away their daily worries, even if just aimlessly? It would add up to the existing immersion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhew.

(What a waste of 50k) \\n\\n- Gold Cap: I see no actual purpose forcing people to be gold capped at 999,999 (Previously 300,000) and then having an accomplishment to earn 100,000,000 gold.\\n\\n- Tool Durability: Why aren't upgraded tools not pushed into a broken state instead of downgrading them when overused? It seems rather lazy/boring to force people to remake their tools with their resources if they just so happen to not be paying full attention to their durability rather than just going to repair the item. \\n\\n- Premium Currency: While I understand the developers need to make money to keep their game running, some of the outfits are absurdly expensive for a game that's in beta and I believe it would be a good addition to introduce ways to earn that currency in-game through participation in-game.\\n\\n- Lack of trading/marketplace: One of the main concerns that I am reading as to why people are gate-keeping the idea of trading or having a marketplace in this game falls upon the economy being ruined by people gold-selling or gold-buying and truthfully while that can be used as a solid argument there are already numerous ways people are cheating to get ahead in the game and have ways to bypass the current 'request' system using hacks. \\n\\n- Character Creation: Please give us more ways to customise our characters (especially males) and please add a blonde hair colour!\\n\\nI truly don't think Palia is a bad game.

I think you really need to change the hairstyle designer, most of feminine hair are not so good looking.

If you farm a node near someone else, they can collect it when you are done, or you can farm it together and save on durability.  If someone is in your party and you both farm a node, or are in close proximity, you each have a chance to double the material you find.  So that's 4 times as much than if you were by yourself for just 2 people.  Party size of up to 4.  \\n\\nAlso, there is no health bar.  There is no fall damage, there is no drowning, no sleeping; for players.  The NPCs sleep but you can still interact with them by going to their homes, even when sleeping.  It's kind of a cool game.\\n\\nI don't know about the future of this game.  I know there has been a known issue with one of the quests, a pretty important issue for a much involved quest.  There are about 700 people who have put in requests for it to be repaired over the last 6 months, and it hasn't been closed.  People have said they are in transition, the company sold to someone else.  I don't know if that is true but it seems if it was sold then someone is probably planning to do something with it.\\n\\nIt also has some other quirky things about it but I mean, it's free.  So if you like this kind of a game I'd say just give it a try.  I'm glad I did and I'd like to see it grow.\\n\\nThe in game store stuff looks cool if you are into that.

I knew going in that because the game was free there was likely going to be some in-game purchasable stuff somewhere. But I was a little disappointed to see that ALL of the outfits in the clothing store were locked behind a paywall, the pets as well. Looking at the prices it was pretty expensive for just for one too. I enjoyed the questing part of the game but it feels like the only goal is to grind and finish your house. Not to mention the only ways to gain money I’ve found are just by selling fish and bugs and those barely sell for anything. \\n\\nI would have much rather spent 20 or 30 bucks to play the game when it was more polished and it have little to no in-game purchases.

      "I have been playing since Open Beta started last August, longer than I have been playing on Steam. There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. \n",
      "1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\n",
      "2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\n",
      "3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\n",
      "4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\n",
      "5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\n",
      "6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \n",
      "7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \n",
      "8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \n",
      "9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \n",
      "10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\n",
      "11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\n",
      "12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\n",
      "13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \n",
      "14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \n",
      "15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \n",
      "16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\n",
      "17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\n",
      "18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \n",
      "19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\n",
      "20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\n",
      "21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run! \n",

      "This game is basically Stardew Valley if it was 3D and had a quarter of the content. You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the game also has plenty of problems.\n",
      "- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.\n",
      "- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.\n",
      "- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.\n",
      "- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.\n",
      "- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon. \n",

      "I really wanted to like Palia, but I couldn't stay excited about it past release. The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \n",
      "There are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They're okay. It's not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn't hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn't hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don't hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don't make it very exciting to play. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn't bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don't feel inviting at all. I can't be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn't well designed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn't enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It's just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don't change, I don't recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you're making a game and when you're designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it's just not quite enough.

However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\n",

These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited.

I LOVE the beautiful graphics and the challenge of figuring out how to play without a lot of game guides next to me. What I haven't enjoyed is my computer crashing on me because my graphics card isn't hefty enough to handle this game. It's a good thing I'm not a serious gamer.

      "i don't usually leave reviews but i was so taken aback by just how poor several key aspects of this game are i feel compelled. you should take any money you might have spent on this game's insanely overpriced cosmetics and find yourself something else. there are plenty of games that do well what palia is attempting and failing to do. this studio has gone through massive layoffs a few times now and an acquisition recently so this game may not have much time left anyway. from reading other reviews from people who have been playing since alpha, the devs are also actively hostile towards the players and have been on more than one occasion on blog posts and on discord, including threatening to make the game worse on purpose, that's always a good sign...\n",
      "it should also be noted i absolutely do not hate this game for being \"woke\" and i, as someone who would be considered \"woke\" through my sheer existence, actually have no idea what so many simpletons in the reviews are referring to as \"woke\" unless they mean the fact that... you can play as a black person? there are women in the game? there are characters with locs? you can date any villager? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a hyper macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, that isn't the game's fault nor is it \"woke\", and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you'd feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is \"woke\", i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let's continue on.\n",
      "\n",
      "just tried this out for a few hours and it was kind of fun gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small and visually not very interesting. the art style and design for the player character is generic. there's not much to do or work toward. you can chop down trees and break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops, fish or catch bugs, craft items, decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you'll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers. i will say what there is available to do is pretty chill, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game's other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there. perhaps if you are brand spanking new to games like this i could understand.\n",
      "the biggest issue for me, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired; especially compared to the diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i'm basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creator options whatsoever.\n",
      "i figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute clothing. i was wrong! you CANNOT obtain any clothes! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothing and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color schemes as well. pets are also purchased with real money. i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money (seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn't tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely). but i am not willing to shell out $20+, that being on the LOW end of the price ranges, on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what's been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics. just because fortnite does it, doesn't mean you should! i exited and uninstalled palia due to my disappointment the moment i figured out you cannot obtain cosmetics or pets without paying a stupid amount of money. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this, and i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that's supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don't want to open your wallet, because ALL cosmetic items are paid for with real money and are very expensive, and this includes pets. there are no pets that do not cost real money, and a limited number of boring clothes in the character creator. the lack of pets and cosmetics is a huge blow to the game and as such there is not much to work toward, since there is not that much to do and not many players around. the character customization is extremely lacking and one of the worst i have seen. if you want to play anyway i'd still be wary about spending real money if i were you, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \n",

Overall, would recommend! :) The scripts of the characters are fun, the voice actors all do a great job bringing life into the game, the concepts are clever, most of the puzzles are rewarding to figure out on the tougher quests (although I wish they'd have some sort of difficulty level feature on quests before you accept them? or a way to refuse quests for the time being.)\n",

      "The game is very fun! I find many aspects similar to Stardew Valley, but as a third-person RPG? The quests are interesting and there's lots to do. Great for ADHD, if you're prepared to sit down and play a game for hours haha. There are still some glitches, of course, it's the beta version. But to be honest, lots of games release their full versions in worse condition. This game being free is a STEAL.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the devs and new players, here are some of the glitches I've noticed:\n",
      "- Immediately after closing your inventory or tool selection, you can walk left and right but not forward. This becomes a bit inconvenient when you've chopped down a tree and are trying to switch to your bow. \n",
      "- The game sometimes crashes or the server disconnects (occasionally this is just on my end due to unstable wifi). When this happens, the tutorials are occasionally reset. Turning off tutorials would solve this problem, however, as there is often new content to see/unlock, tutorials are helpful throughout the course of the playthrough (at least where I'm at 30 hours in). So I'd prefer to honestly just click through the tutorials again rather than turn them off, but now I've had to do this 3-4 times. This has happened to my mom as well.\n",
      "- When closing the game, I have to force close it through Steam, which I've noticed when restarting it. It doesn't close despite clicking exit game. It doesn't show up on my hot bar, but steam still says that it's running. This might be an issue on Steams end.\n",
      "- My fish/bug collection broke :(. You can add prize fish and bugs to your plot to display. I guess I added too many, and now only some of my display cases actually show the bug/fish. The rest show the checkered textureless pattern instead. I'm not sure which setting I'd need to turn on to fix that. My fish/bug display was my favourite part of my plot but now it's a bit of a graveyard with only some fish visible among their bretheren, \n",
      "- This is something that is honestly hard to run into so I doubt it will be an issue for most people: if you get kicked out of the game or it crashes outside of the housing plots, where you receive the welcome message from the developers, don't open your inventory. I triggered my inventory tutorial, which asked me to click on something on the screen, but the welcome message from the dev team popped up at the same time. I couldn't interact with either, so had to force shutdown the game. Great way to get stuck, but also a bit funny. Again, probably not likely to happen, but a fun bit of misfortune to share haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last suggestion, but when I first started playing I didn't realise I'd be receiving mail from the villagers. Most games have mailboxes as a way to receive update newsletters and messages from the dev team. There's also just so much to check out the mail box was ignored for a bit too long. I know the tutorial mentions that Auni brings the mail every morning, but maybe mentioning in the tutorial that new mail will come in as your relationships with the villagers increases, or having checking the mailbox as a quest objective would help. I know my mom had the same issue where she was struggling with a quest because she didn't know to check the mail box. Now I check it all the time, I love the function! I really love the characters you can meet and interact with in this game. \n",
      "\n",
      "I might come back and review it again once I get farther into the quest lines. So far I'm enjoying it. My mom also plays and she's been enjoying it a lot. I think the characters and relationship developments are my favourite part of the game so far. I would definitely recommend trying this game. \n",

Aside from that, it has all the same play style that are parallel to Minecraft. There are skills like Hunting and Fishing, but no potential hazards like Creepers, Spiders and such. That said, the crafting, cooking, and overall features of the game are fun. The focus is heavily based on building a \"Community\" and creating bonds with the NPC's and other like-minded players.

The fast travel is a joke. You either pay to travel, or have to wait for the free one which is 15-30 minutes with each use. It honestly seems arbitrary. Why make the player wait? Your gameplay is limited by time. You cannot progress time for it is on a server. You are forced to wait for specific windows to carry out tasks.

During my character creation something happened to the controls and the mouse input was shifted diagonally from where the mouse icon actually was, making it impossible to click anything. I had to restart the game multiple times and only got it to work once I changed the screen resolution. I tried playing for a bit, and although I usually love these types of grindy homestead games, Palia really didn't do it for me. The whole world feels a bit hollow, like an amusement park with no people in it. Hopefully if this game picks up and gets more players, that will change.

      "palia is a semi-casual life sim, where the focus isn't Entirely on farming alone, but on multiple skills/tasks, exploring, and befriending the townspeople. i would hesitate to call it Completely casual because i've needed a fair amount of grinding for certain quests and skills, but palia is a game that seems more suited to taking it a day at a time and not trying to grind everything out like i did lol. i've done most available quests (excluding romance-related quests, some found-item quests, and tedious collection ones) and i feel comfortable reviewing it and saying i've really enjoyed this game!! it offers so much FOR FREE!!! (multiplayer wasn't a Huge feature for me tho tbh, other than ppl helping with flow trees or calling out rare resources in chat).\n",
      "\n",
      "palia is a vibrant alien setting where you play a human who's suddenly magically spawned here and has to make a living and find their place in this new world. there are two main maps currently: kilima valley -which has mountains, rivers, and meadows- and bahari bay -which is mostly mountains, beaches, and shores- (and each one has lots of nooks and crannies for you to explore). there's two species you meet, majiri (humanoid-looking aliens(?) of varying colorful skintones), and grimalkin (furry anthro cat-looking species). and there's also some droid/robot people here too called Gaulders, whose makers seem to be long gone. there's some fascinating lore you figure out through exploring and completing mainline quests that reveals a hidden depth to this deceptively cheerful/carefree, colorful world and hints at a dark catastrophe that happened a long time ago. plot-wise, i find the story intriguing and i'm excited to see this content updated in the future because it currently isn't completed. \n",
      "\n",
      "i find that palia's cast of characters is wonderful too. each character is unique and like all sims, they have their likes and dislikes, their own routines and places/people they tend to hang out with. they all have really fantastic designs, voice actors (not every line is voiced), and are all distinguished characters with clear personalities. a fascinating mechanism that i have not seen before that's implemented here is a refreshing take on the regular gifting mechanic. similar to other sims, you gift villagers to befriend them, BUT the player must actually TALK to the villagers OR the people around them to figure out what they'd like. each villager can only be gifted one item per real life day and they also have a wanted-items list that refreshes each week, in addition to their respective normal individual liked-items lists (in case you can't get their weekly wants but still want to improve your friendship with gifts). the more your friendship levels up with a character, the more specific weekly-want items they will ask of you. this system incentivizes the player to talk daily with the characters to figure out what gifts they OR other characters may want and allows the player to organically befriend the villager and understand the relationships they may have with other villagers. it's such a simple change to have, where you occasionally have to talk to Other villagers in order to get to know another villager better, but it helps with the immersion. like of course it makes sense that one character would mention something her brother likes, or another character will tell you what his mother needs this week. increasing villager friendship and doing other activities leads you to gain renown, which you can use to buy more land on your property, licenses to have more appliances, and some home decorations.\n",
      "\n",
      "what do you do in the game? well you've got the typical life sim stuff: mining, foraging, cooking, and fishing. but palia also has hunting, furniture-making, and bug-catching (which is basically pokemon LOL, throw balls at it until it's caught). aside from functional skills and activities, there is also cosmetic decorating which is very fun!! the current system for the functional skills is pretty straightforward: do the activity, collect the resource, earn exp to level up. and the more you level up, the more you have access to higher level tools in each of the respective skills. (there is also a mechanism where eating food isn't for energy that limits what you can do everyday, but for a \"focus bar\" that increases the Amount of exp you get from doing these activities. you can still earn exp without the focus bar. but you can use renown to level up your focus bar to boost your exp gain and also increase the length of the focus bar as well). each of these activities is also tied to a character in the game, so there is greater immersion in getting better at these skills and learning from the characters who are more experienced than you at the start. eventually you will reach level 10 where you can join the respective skill guilds and have access to each related skills currency to purchase guild-specific items (ingredients, materials, one-use tools, various decorations for your house). there's a Lot to do in palia lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "i think aside from the story, characters, and typical activities, the biggest draw for people to palia must be the decorating. palia has a fantastic decorating system with a MULTITUDE of furniture options and aesthetics you can mix and match. of course the player can buy these at the in-game furniture shop with in-game currency, but it is much cheaper to level up your furniture-making skill, gain the materials, and do it yourself. the game has two main places to buy furniture: the furniture shop run by Tish and also Zeki's underground gambling ring. all the villagers tied to skills also have some related decorations available for purchase with money and guild tokens too. anyway, you can really go in-depth with decorating in this game. furniture with open-able parts actually let you put things in them (ie cabinets), furniture with light can actually be turned on and off, seats can be sat on, and bookshelves can actually be decorated with books! from plushies, to beds, to dishware, sofas, counters, and so on - there's just so much that palia's decorating has to offer someone. there's even furniture modification kits too, which i haven't figured out yet bc i don't go too deep into decorating, but i'm sure it adds to the customization factor. if you enjoy decorating your home in the sims, you will LOVE decorating in palia. you can also decorate Outside the house as well, changing your roof type and color, painting the walls outside and even the foundation. most furniture you can also place outside too, since palia offers outdoor furniture and structures to make your plot more homey. there's also house tours, where you can look at other player's homes if you wish! palia, unlike most other life sims, also lets you change the layout of your house, choosing which rooms go where, what size rooms they are, what type of doorway each room has (no closed doors though). these additional rooms and structures can be earned through making furniture, being gifted by tish when you level up in furniture-making, and purchasing them from the town hall using in-game money or renown. palia also lets you decorate the outside of your home with flowers, trees, and other plants grown through seeds you get from bug collecting and foraging. speaking of which, you can also decorate your home with star-level bugs, food you make, fish, and other star-level materials. palia really lets you go ham with decorating if you are into that and i love it. \n",
      "\n",
      "all this said, the only major complaint i have is searching for rare materials lol. i don't mind them being hard to find in general because that's what \"rare\" means, but there was a quest where i needed a ruby and i was farming for HOURS IRL for like 4 DAYS STRAIGHT. i just beg the devs: if the item's needed for a quest, PLEASE INCREASE THE DROP RATE FOR THE PLAYER UNTIL THEY GET ONE. i was legit running on fumes trying to find a ruby and mining everything piece of palium ore i could find. \n",

      "It is such a fun game! Most of my time is spent in the card game, but that's just to get free money and other stuff lolll. When I am not \"gambling\" I am immersed in the world of Palia. There is so much to explore, so many quests, so much lore to all the different characters that you'll meet. Maybe even start a little romance with them. Some awesome children NPC's that you just automatically fall in love with and are like \"I must protect at all costs\". I highly recommend Palia, and even have to a couple of friends. I love the online aspect, only thing is I wish we could build on other peoples housing plots and give each other gifts without having to request a certain amount of something through the whole server; even then sometimes they don't have the thing you want to request. Also, what is with having to keep all the chests that have loot in them TwT; TOO MANY CHESTS, YOU CANT EVEN SELL THEM LOL. Also, I understand this is a free game and they have to make money somehow but the cost for coins to get cute cosmetics is wayyyyyy too much; in my opinion, again, free game - got to make money somehow, especially with how much work has clearly been put into this game. Hopefully down the line they were lower the prices or have just more free stuff available. Anyways, overall I do really enjoy Palia; if you have played Zelda: BOTW or TOTK then I think you'll enjoy this game, though there really isn't any fighting with monsters so maybe I'm wrong. It for sure scratches the itch of wanting multiplayer in those Zelda games, of course unless you mod your game. :)) \n",

      "My one nitpick so far is that the furniture you make isn't sellable. You use up loads of resources to craft things for experience that you don't really need or want to furnish your home - so you end up with a bunch of extra furniture taking up your inventory spaces unless you destroy them. Feels like a waste, honestly. Gold is hard to keep around, and you need to basically craft one of everything to discover most of the furniture set recipes, so getting a little gold back from selling your extras would make that feel more balanced. \n",

      "Palia is one of those games that just grabs you from the start. The first thing that hits you is how insanely beautiful everything is. The world is so vibrant and alive, with amazing landscapes, colorful villages, and lush forests that make you want to explore every inch. The colors pop and the details are so intricate that you can almost feel the wind and hear the leaves rustling as you move around.\n",

      "The characters are just as impressive as the world they live in. Each one has their own unique look and vibe, and the animations are super smooth.

Whether you’re making new friends in the village or meeting mysterious characters on your adventures, everything looks and feels amazing.\n",

The world is rich with lore and history, and every quest feels like a piece of a larger puzzle that you’re dying to solve. The dialogue is engaging and adds depth to the characters, making every interaction feel meaningful. You quickly find yourself invested in their stories and the fate of the world around you.\n",

      "One of the coolest things about Palia is how your choices matter. The world changes based on what you do, making the story feel personal and dynamic. This level of interactivity adds a lot of depth to the game and makes you feel like you’re truly part of the story. The quests are varied and interesting, keeping things fresh and exciting. Whether you’re solving puzzles, building relationships, or going on epic adventures, there’s always something new to discover.\n",

The grind can become a chill process, giving you time to appreciate the beauty of the world and the intricacies of the game’s systems.\n",

Its gorgeous artwork creates a world that’s a joy to explore, and its well-crafted storyline provides a rich and immersive experience.

      "The game is over all fun and enjoyable. The features currently present lead me to hope and believe that there will be better updates in the future to make it even better. The open world theme is fun but it leaves a lack of knowledge or know how on where to go and what to do to get the next upgrade or item. While also restricting your ability to progress and gather better tools until NPC dialogue acknowledges your progression. \n",
      "\n",
      "The map is simple to understand however having no displayed mini map does make things slightly more annoying, however the map is easy enough to learn.  Leaving you to explore and gather various items as you start out. Fishing being the only non-restrictive tool/function. You may catch any fish from anywhere in the map with any rod, it just may be more challenging. \n",
      "\n",
      "The MULTIPLAYER feature is convoluted with no explanation, guide or information on how to play with friends. To even get the multiplayer window you have to hit \"O\" and add your friends, there is no direct invite or join through steam. The progression and growth are all single player/localized so you cannot help each other complete the story or even run through and enjoy it together in a party.

      "\n",
      "As it currently stands, its a nice a cozy game that looks and feels very homely but it has a lot of problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the first problem is that it is unstable, daily crashes and disconnects (your time, not game time). Once you get more people in a small area, lag. Hunting/gathering objects frequently disappear underground never to be seen again. Loot sometimes is unlootable which if you spent time going after a strong target solo can be frustrating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, really poor in game connectivity. It is hard to get groups going and group play is how the game is really designed to be played. Solo play is fine but if you are hunting an target that is in a tree, you need to cut the tree down, switch weapon and then try and shoot it and with the current system, that could take a few seconds and by then, its already beyond the next hill and climbing another tree. Then if its an enemy that can turn invisible, well, it may turn invisible and by the time the new invisible animation appears, its too far to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Game mechanics like fishing, well, you can get fish that are docile as well as those that fight to a point it is impossible to reel in, not breed or anything, just feels very random if they will dart left to right or hop out of the water making fishing inconsistent. On top of that, you can gain a 50% decrease in waiting by fishing near somebody and with the bonus of grouping up, the different between solo play and grouped up is pretty insane. Increased yield and decreased time just by grouping up but in game, its hard to get anybody to group up. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a long story but it isn't helped by walls of text to convey things that really aren't that interesting, the more I play, the less inclined I am to read any of it and just click through everything. I think this is one of those games that could benefit from some good in game clips and voice narration for at least the main quest chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real redeeming quality is the building of your own personal plot but the problem with that is the price tag. Making it slow and painful to do but people still do it and it is still fun to go through. The lack of variation however is a bit disappointing but considering the game is still far from complete, that should be there by release day in about 5 or 6 years at its current rate. \n",

So the fact that I've stuck around without taking a break for more than a week or two at a time speaks volumes.\n",

If you don't have any friends who play it (yet hehe), though, fret not! The community tends to be very friendly, and I've made *many* friends with people I've encountered out and about. You also can get by just fine on your own, if you prefer that! I usually get bored with a grind, but I actually really enjoy it in this game. There's lots to do running around out in the world, and you always have all of the tools you need with you, so you can kinda do anything and everything all the time, which feels very satisfying. It's a pleasure to get distracted and sidetracked while gathering resources, and even better with friends!\n",

Something not fitting very well while snapping to the grid? No problem! Just toggle the grid off in free placement mode. Tired of your house and feel like starting over, but don't want to lose all the work you've done? Easy peasy! Just leave it as is and open up a brand new plot to start from scratch! It is really mind-blowing how much you have to work with, and they're very regularly adding new furniture lines.

There is some enjoyable story and fun characters, but the game is in Beta and the story content isn't super long. If that's all you're here for, you might not last long. But there is [i] so [/i] much content at our disposal for decorating, and that's where I find the most fulfillment in this game.\n",
      "Also, Palia is in Beta. It definitely has a number of issues and bugs. New issues do often come up as new patches are deployed. But the devs address these issues as quickly as they can, and they're usually very on top of handling the more major and disruptive bugs fast. These things can be frustrating at times, but it's early access and free game, so I try to stay patient because I know S6 is working as hard as they can to improve the experience.\n",

Everything, aside from some story-quest instanced areas, is a shared where all activities can be shared with others, and you're actively encouraged to do so. There's mechanics in place to allow un-partied players to cooperate with each other, while partied players have a small chance to duplicate their resources while near each other. The most commons mechanics for this are: 1. that if you ever \"tag\" a resource once, no matter where you are on the map, when it's finally harvested, you get full credit and loot, and 2. if someone harvests some resources, these resources continue to exist for others from 3 minutes, the same length of time as the completely optional, and cheap to make, flare you can launch.

      "The game itself feels a bit like other cozy-casual games like stardew valley, from all the various resource gathering skills, and your interactions with the villagers, and your ability to even romance several of them (or all of them). There's a day-night cycle of 1-hour to 24-hours, split into 4 parts of an entire day, with different resources and events available at different times. There's also a heavy focus on exploration and platforming, including a BotW-style gliding and climbing system. You can spend dozens of hours in some areas, and still find new hidden loot that is sometimes just hiding in plain sight. There's even an only-up-style climbing section with its own record keeping and rewards.\n",

      "Unfortunately, the game is also heavily inundated with bugs and issues. This is a social-heavy game, but the social elements only work half the time. While the movement experience is almost entirely smooth for yourself, with no teleporting from lag, sometimes you just wont grip a climbable object. Other players are often teleporting or appear to be under the world. Moving objects and creatures will often teleport due to other players interacting with them, and the server syncing you to their cycle instead. Finally, the party system is completely broken: half the time people just don't get your invite, sometimes when accepted, it doesn't show you in the party when you are, sometimes while in a party, the game tells you that you left, but you're still in the party, and even when you actually leave a party, the party will continue to exist for a short while anyways. There's even ways to partially softlock your quest progress, since your quest inventory has a limit, but you can at times get as many of some quest items as you like, but thankfully you can store quest items in your storage without limits, so you can work around this issues that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. \n",

On the other hand, I am honestly disappointed with how much they charge for the in-game outfits. It is outrageous to be charging 20-35 euro for the good skins/clothes. These are prices you can expect from triple A titles and not a game which had 12553 players at it's absolute peak. As a very customization and appearance oriented gamer it is always something I look for in the games I play, and while the base game outfits are fine as a starter, personally I got bored with them very quick. Re-thinking the pricing or adding more base game outfits and customization would be a good improvement imo.

Allowing players to slowly earn premium currency without being forced to spend real money for cosmetics (even a paid seasonal pass of some sort with a progression system would be better than nothing!) It costs too much money to buy a single outfit. I went ahead and bought one to support the game since it is free-to-play, but it will likely be the only thing I purchase because it was $16.

I wish there were more benefits to romancing a villager and an increase in the lot cap size (can only place 3,000 items INCLUDING pathing and only 500 flowers) Maybe more games in the underground, a way to crafting the modification kits. An easier way to fast travel. I would like to see a buff in the tuning fork and hunting horn because they aren't really needed. Maybe the tuning fork spawns more fishing nodes in 1 area or the hunting horn being able to track the Bluebristle Muujin in trees.

      "Tldr: The game is not exactly what was initially advertized, still provides some fun. It is ok if you love playing with decorations and setting up a dream house. Or you want to liquify your brain for a little while. But overall the game is secondary, does not bring much novelty and needs work. Recomended only for those who are really into that artistic and self expression stuff in games.\n",

      "After 80 hrs in the game, I think I personally would not recommend myself to start playing it, if put 80 hrs of game time back. Not that I did not enjoy it, I had quite a bit of fun for some time, but then the negatives kicked in. I chose \"yes\" for recommendations since there are certanly people who are or will enjoy it. And if the game is developed further, it can actually become a great game, but it is not there yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Positives.\n",
      "1) This game is relaxing and chill. The exact thing I needed for my vacation. You know that none of your actions can harm your progress or any relation with the villagers. This game is indeed cozy. You can turn off your brain and go with the flow without any thought. Good escapism tool.\n",
      "2) The graphics seem nice if a bit generic. \n",
      "3) The Galdurs (robots) are adorable. \n",
      "4) It's free. There is no pay to win monetization which is great and developers must be applauded for that. \n",
      "5) Although, it is advertized as a preferably multyplayer game, you don't actually have to have a party to fullfill any quest of receipe. You can experience the whole game solo.\n",
      "6) It is actually quite interesting and enjoyable to see how each character in the village evolves, how these little dialogues or monologues are changing in course of the game.\n",
      "7) The cooking is fun.\n",
      "8) And generally the storyline and the discovery aspect of the game are quite engaging and fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives.\n",
      "1) This is indeed a 3d Stardew valley. Meaning the experience is quite familiar and not novel at all. Basically all the mechanics are similar or entirelly the same: you gain a plot of land, first you need to clear it of junk, you buy seeds and start farming, you aquire receipes for furniture and decorations for the house, you meet villagers and give them gifts on a regular basis to achieve certain level of relation, and the preferences for items are unique for each villager. You fish for different types of fish in different locations, at different daytime and with different bait, etc.\n",
      "2) There is a lot of grind. Not the asian level of grind but still. Most of the quests are very similar and become boring.\n",
      "3) The emphasis on the building and decoration worked for me only that long. Problem with the decorations and furniture is that it is not functional. For the kitchen - Yes, it is interesting and fun to decorate and improve it so it becomes beautiful AND more convenient and functional. The rest of the house: not so much. Obviously, there are people who can enjoy this artistic aspect of the game much more, but for me the questline and learning the plot is more important, while the decorative part is a nice extra on the side.\n",
      "4) The game appeared to be not exactly what I expected from the initial announcements and trailers. It was sold with the idea of \"build something together\". And I imagined that players would obtain plots of land and build houses in a COMMON space, so you could see a settlement grow, see what everyone does with the decorations and fulfill certain roles in the community, If not globally, at least within the group. Of course my expectations are my problem, especially it is silly to complain since the game is free. But in my eyes the way the game was \"sold\" to the audience and the result are quite a bit different, and this is certainly not what I expected and wanted. Imagine Valheim, with its freedom of building, where you and you friends can really build something together. That is what I was imagining before I played the game. The instanced secluded plot of land cetanly feels empty, lonely. disconnected and ruins the feelling of being a part of the community, which the game apparently was intended to provide.\n",
      "5) Why on earth you cannot sell furniture??? You can sell forage, game, bugs, metals, crops and food, but not furniture? Which you foraged materials for, produced and do not need so much of? That is beyond my comprehension.\n",
      "6) Limit of 9 3x3 farming plots is annoying and feels artificially imposed to limit the pacing without any explanation lorewise.\n",
      "7) Connection of certain mechanics to the real world time (growing crops, delays between giving presents, etc.) reeks of mobile gaming and again artificial boundries to limit the pacing.\n",
      "6) The story is not finished and it is uncertain whether it will be. The feelling of being hooked to the plot with no answers and the ending really cut it for me. The cliff hanger situation is annoying. There is very little replayability for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I would say the game is Ok, but not great. I had some fun, but I'd rather spend these 80 hrs on something more worthy. It is free though, so really very little to complain about. \n",

Packed full of adventurous quests and tasks friendly and the not so friendly townsfolk,you meet many along the way and soon learn their likes and dislikes within different tasks requested of your character. As you progress further into game play you can upgrade your weapons,bow,arrows by crafting better ones and even repairing the basic models once you've learned the recipes to do so. Crafting,fishing,hunting,gardening,cooking,puzzle based quests,etc is some of the exciting activities here. Takes a bit of foraging and mining to get your character's skills to level up but it is well worth the wait once you receive the glider.

      "Pros:\n",
      "- Base game is free, only paid content is aesthetic, so there's no pay to win.\n",
      "- Game is based around community and generally has a very positive and supportive player base. Everyone I've encountered has been helpful save for 1 or 2. You'll have that in every game, but this game seems to have fewer trolls/griefers than others.\n",
      "- Game is relatively easy to get the hang of while remaining challenging. Basic mechanics are easy to understand, but you'll still need skill and practice to catch/hunt some more rare creatures\n",
      "- So far, there are consistent updates and devs seem quite transparent about their intentions. Updates seems based on user feedback, which I'm pretty happy to see\n",
      "- Characters are relatively diverse and different enough from each other. Also... kinda love that not EVERYONE has a tragic backstory. I love that we have romanceable characters who are just \"I just wanna be a farmer\" even if that's not my cup of tea.\n",
      "- Story is super promising! It had me immediately intrigued and locked in\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Paid content seems a bit on the pricey side; I'd love for paid content to remain aesthetic only, but at a lower cost. I'd pay for base game and then have cheaper paid cosmetics, if that makes sense. Or perhaps ways to accumulate small amounts of premium currency, like rare achievements or something?\n",
      "- There are only 2 adventure zones at the moment--they are pretty fleshed out, and this is still a Beta game, so this isn't too much of a problem (A 3rd zone is being released early next year apparently!)\n",
      "- This was addressed in a recent post by dev, but I'll reiterate it--increase decor limit!\n",
      "- I'd love to see more random treasure chests too. I love collecting them. (Not really a con, I just want hundreds of those cute little chests) Let me keep the chest from the waterlogged chest please!!!\n",
      "- There are some characters I'd love to see more depth of. For instance, more story with Jina, Hekla, Elouisa, Einar, etc. I'm sure there are plans for more characters in new zones/future updates, so again this isn't really a problem too much\n",

There are some quests that will definitely makes you think to solve them. A lot of people don't like this game due to the fact that there is a cosmetic store, but let's be honest, the game is free itself so the developer just trying to find a simple way to earn something back, and it is solely up to your decision to get those items or not, they are not required to enhance the gaming experience. One thing I really love about this game is the NPCs, they don't just stand still in one spot, they move around just like other players and you have to actively look for them through the map and the compass, which is very realistic in my opinion. \n",

However the story is unfinished and I'm just stuck in this farming/gathering and customizing loop with not much else to do, the devs seem to be able to drop new cosmetics bundles all the time but nothing for the actual story. The mechanics are rather laggy and glitchy at times, you can NOT change your character name at ALL or have more than one character, and lord help you if you're playing on Switch... I liked how everything I did on PC was seamlessly accessible on my Switch, but the actual mechanics are very annoying and makes it almost unplayable on that platform.\n",

Like....juuuust on this side of mobile game grindy. BUT, that being said....it is absolutley NOT a pay to win game. There is zero way to get an advantage buy spending real money.

I like how different the idea of progression is here. Level is based around all your skill levels, game progression based around your relation ship with the locals. Your own plot to expand and develop as you please. The world map isnt too big but large enough to get lost in, without any pressure to speed up your travel via mounts (although point to point travel is available). There is lots to enjoy here that very very quickly gets bypassed in other open world games. \n",

      "I’m absolutely captivated by Palia for so many reasons. First off, the game truly shines when it comes to encouraging cooperative play—there's something so special about working together and building community in a space like this. And let me tell you, the lack of death penalties is a game-changer; it means I can dive deep into the story without worrying about losing progress. The decorating and crafting aspects are fantastic, offering endless ways to express my creativity and style. The storyline itself is engaging and full of depth, keeping me hooked from start to finish. Plus, I love that you can develop meaningful friendships and even romances with NPCs. It all combines to make Palia a rich and fulfilling experience, blending creativity, community, and storytelling in a way that really resonates with me. \n",

      "What would be better for a company than to make a game that is essentially a mix between Harvest Moon and My Time At Portia? Because that sounds like a great game. Hmmm, making it free to play, adding in micro-transactions and in-game currencies, and raking in a ton more cash then you would get from just selling the basic game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I don't really see or feel the draw when playing. The charm of Harvest Moon is missing, and the scaled material gathering/production of My Time At Portia is missing. This game is a massive grind, a MASSIVE grind; with the time required to make your first basic copper bar being three minutes. They limit the number of material production buildings and make it so you need to buy permission for more, which takes time grinding other things, and on and on it goes. I am sure that this is fun for a lot of people, but I found it quickly tiresome; and this is coming from a person who enjoys scrapping space ships in Hardbreaker and cleaning up in Viscera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the fact that the game straight up lies to you. Single player you say? Alright. That is why I initially gave this game a shot. But there is no single player, and you cannot have a server to yourself, or your own instance. There will always be people around. People hunting the animals you need, or fishing at the spots you wanted, or collecting the ore/bugs/plants/what ever. Add on top of this the fact that in order to travel from your homestead to the main city and back, you need to wait in a queue behind other people. The servers are incredibly laggy and unstable at times. I played for nearly five hours and I don't think I went for more than a half hour without experiencing problems. There was even a time where I was bounced from server to server, one after another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, while this is free, I don't think I will keep playing. I don't feel like this type of game really works well in a multiplayer environment, and that multiplayer environment (the servers) is not given enough upkeep. If you think you will find this kind of game fun, go for it, it is free; but keep it that way. I will not be playing anymore and I don't recommend it only so that people don't get caught up in micro-transaction and in-game currency shenanigans. \n",

      "Palia is a beautiful game that you can sink so much of your free time into. This game is still in BETA, meaning it's still in it's infancy. There has already been so many fabulous updates and bug fixes, and they bring out at least 1 major update every month! Yes there are some bugs still, but be patient and be kind. They are working on ways to fix the annoying ones. This game is free! It gives you SO much content for being a free game. There's endless things to do all time. With thousands of furniture pieces/placeable objects, flowers, trees, building blocks, paths, and more, you can create your homestead any way you want and the possibilities are endless. I've been to some awesome plots where you can just tell people have spent 50 hours alone on just decorating their homes. There's 8 skills to train : Hunting, Gardening, Mining, Foraging, Cooking, Fishing, Bug catching, and Furniture making, with no level cap! There's many in game achievements that are also now steam achievements. The graphics are so beautiful on PC, just ok on Switch. This is a cross-platform (PC & Switch) Cozy MMORPG that allows you to play with your friends on either platform. There is a premium shop with plenty of fancy outfits, pets, and glider and tool skins to purchase with real money. These items can be quite costly, but it's the only way the makers are making any money off of the game. There are many NPC's, with several you can even romance! Each NPC has their own family tree and storyline. This game has a lot of quests with hopes of them bringing even more out for us late-gamers. Singularity 6 actually listens to their players feedback as well! I hope that Daybreak Games continues to make this a free game, accessible for all the play. I've told a few people that I would compare this game to a combination of Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley made into an MMO. There is still so much more to come to Palia!\n",

There is so much to do in this game (if you don't mind repetition. The game can be grindy, but for me, I like that. I like the routine). One minute I'll be arranging some furniture in a new room I've built, then I run down to the bay to get materials, but then I get distracted by some bugs, and what's that? Oh a chest! Lemme fish for a bit. Ah I can do this quest now. It's pure ADHD junk-food and I love it.  The NPCs are great as well. I loved getting to know them and slowly piecing together all the village gossip. The community is nice and helpful. And there are some neat 'mini-games' tucked away in places as well! The game isn't finished at the time of writing this, but it's free.

      "What a lovely, cozy game! I was looking for something cute, relaxing, and farming-like but with more world exploration options, and this hits the spot just right. \n",
      "\n",
      "My personal favorites:\n",
      "- Building: There's so much freedom in building your home, it's crazy. I love how immersive it is. You can customize your home to such tiny details as where and how you place your books. \n",
      "- Crafting: As above with building, you have tons of options and items that you can craft, and every time you craft a new item, you can learn more. Everything can be used to decorate your home/land. Or you can give them to the villagers as gifts. \n",
      "- Farming: I love that you don't just click a button and everything appears or grows. You have to really FARM. The plants will grow over time and require water, and they'll sometimes give you seeds. You can gather wildflowers from your world explorations and get the seeds and grow the plant on your property as well. I don't know if there will be animals though. It doesn't seem so. You can also buy seeds from the farmer NPC.\n",
      "- Fishing: Fishing seems straightforward enough, but it isn't easy for everyone. Once I learned how to do it, I love it now. You can use fish for cooking, gifting, or even put it in a fish tank on your own property. \n",
      "- Cooking: I don't have much to say about this, but I love it when you can cook in games and gather recipes. Food can be used to restore your energy or as a gift.\n",
      "- Wardrobe: You're not stuck with the same looks forever. Change your clothing, hair, and accessories. The default ones are for free, but you can make an in-game purchase for cooler items, pets, and whatnot. \n",
      "- Friendships: The village has a number of NPCs, each with their own unique personality and story. They are NOT static. Each one has their own routine, the places they visit, and you see them moving around a lot. For those who love immersion, I think it's perfect. They will only stay in the same place if it's their \"job\" but they also get their free time and go to bed at night. Besides that, befriending different villagers gives you different perks/items/skills/etc.\n",
      "- Romance: I haven't gotten this far, but I noticed that some of the NPCs have an additional icon for romance, which unlocks after you get Lvl 3 in friendship. I don't know if marriage is an option, but I hope so. Oh, and the game doesn't filter if you play as a female or male character.\n",
      "- Village: The village itself is very cute, with various shops and secret places that you can find. Every time I feel like I've seen everything, I still find something new, something secret.\n",
      "- Secrets: You can stumble onto books, letters, strange items, and secret places. There are tons of things to discover.\n",
      "- Player Farms: You can visit other players' homes and wow, they're so beautiful and creative.\n",
      "- Immortality: You can't die. You can run out of energy, but you won't die if you fall from a cliff. Yay. Oh, and nobody attacks you. Wolves run from you and hide ON THE TREES, which I found so funny. For me, it's a big plus when I want cozy games and not having to think about survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things you can do that I personally feel neutral about:\n",
      "- Mining and wood chopping: You can gather the required materials all over the world. It's part of immersion, but I don't love it and don't hate it either. \n",
      "- Hunting: I personally don't like hunting when some of the animals are SO CUTE. Why would I want to kill it? The game, however, doesn't seem to force it. You have quests that involve gathering meat, but I just bought it in the store without killing the cute animals (although technically it's still dead? Hmm...Okay, let's not question my moralities. :D). \n",
      "- Catching bugs: Same as with fishing, you can catch all sorts of bugs and use them as gifts (yes, some NPCs think it's a fantastic gift), put them in your home and...okay, maybe not for cooking. But you can sell them, so you get money for those worms and whatever. Yay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Uh...I can't think of any. The only thing I dislike about the existing things is hunting cute animals, but that's life, so it's not a problem as long as it stays optional in the game and quests have workarounds like buying the item instead of going for the kill. \n",
      "- Oh, and you can't swim. There's plenty of water but you get respawned nearby if you get inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:\n",
      "- The game is quite immersive for something this cozy (and free), but I feel like it would benefit from letting the player sit or interact with other items that aren't on their own property. You craft a bench and put it in your house—sure, sit on it until your rear falls off. But why can't I sit on a bench in the village? What if I want my rear to fall off there, not on my own property? Or if I visit the inn, why not let me sit at the table? Okay, I get why I can't walk into a stranger's house and empty their fridge, but why can't I sit at the inn? Or read the books at the library? I mean, I don't need to actually read random paragraphs, but an animation with a rising skill would be lovely, for example, if i pick up a book about fishing or something along those lines.\n",
      "- I can buy/craft a musical instrument, but I can't play it. It would be fun if artistic activities were optional just as much as cooking or whatever else in the game. For example, when you complete quests or speak daily to the NPCs, you get reputation points. Playing an instrument that I've crafted could affect it. Maybe my instruments even squeak while I have a low skill and then get better over time just like crafting recipes and stuff. \n",
      "- SWIMMING!!! I don't need a deep sea experience, but being respawned every time I wet my feet is quite annoying when I could just swim over. I understand that this might serve a purpose of not letting me near a place that's supposed to be hard to get to, but I think other obstacles would have been better. You gave us so many nice places and the game is cozy, why not let some players swim away their daily worries, even if just aimlessly? It would add up to the existing immersion.\n",

The mouse function stopped working and I was unable to click on anything. My xbox controller did allow me to select things, but for some reason could not select ANYTHING from the two rightmost columns on any of the character creation tabs. This was fine, as most of my choices weren't in those columns. However, at the end, I could not finish my character creation, as whatever button it told me to use simply opened up the pause menu and ONLY let me resume by hitting the B button. I noticed that any attempt to navigate the pause menu would input on the character creation tabs and I was essentially just changing the way my character looked from the pause menu.

      "- Limited Storage: I don't like how we are forced to essentially throw away items that we have farmed in order to preserve space, if I have spent hours farming for materials in a specific zone while levelling up my skills or even while trying to hunt a rare bug then I want to be able to keep a large portion of my supplies gathered rather than feeling forced to throw it into the shipping bin or convert it into planks, bars, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Limited Farm Plots: One of the few things I was getting quite excited about was making a primary housing estate and then making a farm house on a secondary plot.. however after further investigation this wasn't possible due to being limited on the amount of farming plots I'm allowed to allocate to my property. (What a waste of 50k) \n",
      "\n",
      "- Gold Cap: I see no actual purpose forcing people to be gold capped at 999,999 (Previously 300,000) and then having an accomplishment to earn 100,000,000 gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tool Durability: Why aren't upgraded tools not pushed into a broken state instead of downgrading them when overused? It seems rather lazy/boring to force people to remake their tools with their resources if they just so happen to not be paying full attention to their durability rather than just going to repair the item. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Premium Currency: While I understand the developers need to make money to keep their game running, some of the outfits are absurdly expensive for a game that's in beta and I believe it would be a good addition to introduce ways to earn that currency in-game through participation in-game.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lack of trading/marketplace: One of the main concerns that I am reading as to why people are gate-keeping the idea of trading or having a marketplace in this game falls upon the economy being ruined by people gold-selling or gold-buying and truthfully while that can be used as a solid argument there are already numerous ways people are cheating to get ahead in the game and have ways to bypass the current 'request' system using hacks. \n",

Six hours later, we found ourselves stuck in the cycle of: \"One more thing, just need to do one more thing...\" before, glazed-eyed, we finally took a break.

If someone is in your party and you both farm a node, or are in close proximity, you each have a chance to double the material you find.

      "It’s a cute game! I mean I wasn’t around for all the past drama, as you can tell from my hours, so I’ll only comment on things I know about. The gameplay is cute, it’s easy to follow and overall pretty clean. Not a fan of the fact that the only clothes I can get (as of now) is the starter clothes OR the giant paid for currency collection of awesome outfits that you can only spend money one. That’s a shame Honestly, I know it’s a beta but putting so many and I mean LOADS of outfits sets that cost real money to get is gross to me. I mean if you can put that much energy into paid content why not give some free outfits too that costs in game currency? I don’t know, might be me looking into but seems like a cash grab for an unfinished game and it makes me feel icky. For that reason, I’m gonna have to not recommend the game until finished, yes it’s cool but you have no expression for yourself. For a game that’s big around being an online world, the fact I’m stuck running around in clothes everyone else is wearing unless I drop $20 or more is lame. \n",

There was rumor, over a year ago that they'd add a variety of body sizes for character customization and just never did. I always wonder why a thin body is always \"default\" and why not immediately have multiple to choose from. I think it's important that your playerbase is capable of seeing themselves in your game, especially if one of your main advertising points was your character customization. There are NPCs with different body types so we can see they're able to do it. It's basically a lack of willingness at this point, unfortunately.

That's all before you even have enough gold to process wood into planks which you need 100 of for your first house.Every blueprint costs 30-100+ gold and you get gold from SOME quests, and there are not enough quests. one quest is to harvest an onion and a  carrot. mine have been watered and weeded and are still growing hours later. You need a blueprint for every upgraded tier of every single tool, a blueprint for the ingots, bricks, etc. And you also need a  blueprint for every crafting station - which there are many- to process items you farm in the wild, and respawn rates of natural resources is also slow. On top of that, the game has lots of microtransactions - although only cosmetic as I am aware. There is currently a bug where color swatches in the character creator are out of order/bugged. \n",

      "May change this review in the future but these are my thoughts at the moment. I knew going in that because the game was free there was likely going to be some in-game purchasable stuff somewhere. But I was a little disappointed to see that ALL of the outfits in the clothing store were locked behind a paywall, the pets as well. Looking at the prices it was pretty expensive for just for one too. I enjoyed the questing part of the game but it feels like the only goal is to grind and finish your house. Not to mention the only ways to gain money I’ve found are just by selling fish and bugs and those barely sell for anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would have much rather spent 20 or 30 bucks to play the game when it was more polished and it have little to no in-game purchases. To me it feels like a money grab and a waste of time with all the grinding. It is a pretty game and has very cozy vibes but I hope the devs can make the necessary changes to really pull this game together. \n",

      "I want to write a fair review, so I'm going to do my best to write one. I've played Palia for over a year at this point, and when the game came to Steam I switched to playing in Steam. I'm not blind to the game's faults, and there are several, but I'm also going to try to focus on the good things about the game, because those do exist. I know that some people think that just because a game is free, it means that the game should be free from being criticised. I've kept in mind that the game is free, but as someone who supported the game by buying cosmetics, I'm also writing this review from that point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "* POSITIVES *\n",
      "\n",
      "- Beautiful world, interesting characters.\n",
      "- Lots of time has been spent in every character's backstory.\n",
      "- Amazing lore and great potential here for them to do so much more with it.\n",
      "- You can easily spend time in this world pottering about and feeling cozy.\n",
      "- I've made some friends here, but like any community, exercise caution with randos.\n",
      "- It's free.\n",
      "\n",
      "* NEGATIVES *\n",
      "\n",
      "- Even after all this time, there are only two areas: Kilima village and Bahari bay. For an MMO world which promises so many other areas in its lore, this has been incredibly disappointing.\n",
      "- It becomes incredibly boring and repetitive very quickly.\n",
      "- The game doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an MMO? Is it a cozy interior decoration game? (The second one is more on point for what it actually is right now.) There are several identity crises that the game is going through.\n",
      "- Bugs, bugs, bugs. So many bugs. Bugs that have existed for absolutely months. It boggles the mind that they keep giving us new cosmetics and interior design items without first fixing the colossal bugs that persist even after a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to play this game with zero expectations, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. But after three months, when the updates are meaningless and bugs afflict your playtime as well, just put it down and move on. I have no idea if Palia will ever be more than what it is now, but as someone who desperately wants them to be great, I'll be silently rooting for them. But I'm not holding my breath, and neither should you. \n",

The world is well served by digital professional services! Thank you for creating this wonderful care portal!\\n\\nFrank Waugh\\nSouthern Pines, NC', rating=5, app_version='2.68'),\n",

With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \\n\\nSecond, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \\n\\nThis format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either.

The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.

The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body.

I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was.

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.

For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store.

I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab. \n",

No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service. What is the point of this service if they can’t actually treat or diagnose you. \n",

      "First, let me say that I am 100000000% good with the text-based format, because anyone that knows me can tell you that phone calls are the bane of my existence. With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n",

      "This format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?! \n",

      "Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went.
