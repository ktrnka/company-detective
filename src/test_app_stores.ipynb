There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. \\r\\n1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\\r\\n2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\\r\\n3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\\r\\n4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\\r\\n5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\\r\\n6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \\r\\n7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \\r\\n8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \\r\\n9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \\r\\n10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\\r\\n11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\\r\\n12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\\r\\n13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \\r\\n14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \\r\\n15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \\r\\n16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\\r\\n17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\\r\\n18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \\r\\n19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\\r\\n20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\\r\\n21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721799278, timestamp_updated=1721799278, voted_up=True, votes_funny=20, votes_up=425, weighted_vote_score=0.8593648672103882, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.\\n\\nHowever, the game also has plenty of problems.\\n- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.\\n- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.\\n- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.\\n- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.\\n- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.\\n\\nMy recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722546795, timestamp_updated=1722547037, voted_up=False, votes_funny=10, votes_up=200, weighted_vote_score=0.8310643434524536, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \\nThere are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They\\'re okay. It\\'s not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn\\'t hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn\\'t hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don\\'t hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don\\'t make it very exciting to play. \\n\\nIt\\'s an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn\\'t bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \\n\\nFor a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don\\'t feel inviting at all. I can\\'t be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn\\'t well designed. \\n\\nI have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn\\'t enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It\\'s just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don\\'t change, I don\\'t recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \\n\\nAgain, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you\\'re making a game and when you\\'re designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it\\'s just not quite enough.

Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.\\n\\nThe gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.\\n\\nDespite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.\\n\\nThe game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\\n\\nWhile Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.\\n\\nPalia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using \"Palia Coins.\" Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I\\'ve spent upwards of $150.\\n\\nAn easy way to earn gold coins in the game is through cake/cooking parties. However, these sessions can become monotonous, requiring long periods of repetitive button and mouse clicking, which can detract from the overall enjoyment.\\n\\nPalia lays the groundwork for a charming and engaging community simulation game but is held back by technical issues, repetitive content, and limited social interactions.

It\\'s not like you\\'re able to walk around a neighborhood and say hi to your neighbors. Sadly, a game doesn\\'t exist like that yet. \\n\\nIf you are DESPERATE for a pet + outfits, there is a cheap $8.50 bundle that has 4 outfits (with color palette swaps) + getting a brown cat for your first premium money purchase. That\\'s as of writing this review. That might change in the future.\\n\\nAs for the slow animations I mentioned before, yes they are still slow, but when you get tool upgrades, your chores go by much much quicker. Also, look up garden layouts for maximum water retention so you don\\'t have to water your crops every damn hour (YES, EVERY IRL HOUR).\\n\\nSo, why am I addicted to this game? I refuse to spend anymore money on it beyond taht $8.50 bundle because this whole game could shut down within the next year, and it\\'s honestly stilll a buggy mess.\\n\\nto be honest, it just gives that nice dopamine hit when you wanna chill and do no brain stuff like mining for ore, cutting down trees, crafting furniture, shoot deer and red pandas, etc. Maybe it\\'s my ADHD and autism that makes it satisfying.\\n\\nStory still isn\\'t engaging. Writing still sucks in my opinion. Some of the main story quests and bugged to hell and back and haven\\'t been fixed since they got released. \\n\\nMaking money does get easier once you hit your stride but yes, the beginning is really damn slow.\\n\\nThe community has been really nice IMO. The \"unspoken\" rules are easy to understand and they aren\\'t a pain. \\n\\nPeople are willing to help you understand. Just gotta ask.\\n\\nBasically, call out rare resources like palium, flow trees, magical hunting targets, rare forage materials, etc with the map coordinates, and flare if you can with everything except the hunting targets.\\n\\nOh yeah, another big downside.\\n\\nThis damn game takes 33gb if you use their client. On steam, I think it takes around 20. To give you an idea of how unnecessary big and and unoptimized this game is...\\n\\nFinal Fantasy 14 Online, with all the expansions including Dawntrail....takes only 90GB on your hard drive. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it looks like optimization and bug fixes are not a priority for the devs at this point.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t handle that, don\\'t bother playing the game. As much as I like this game, once stuff starts filling up on my second hard drive, this game is on the chopping block of getting uninstalled. Which is another reason why I refuse to spend more than $8.50.\\n\\nI think some people were complaining about cliques, but I don\\'t find the game cliquey at all. Again, people are always willing to help out. \\n\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nPlayed it on their app instead of steam. I tried to enjoy it. I played it for a good 10 hours. It\\'s not worth it. The premium shop prices are egregious. Upwards of $30-60 for an outfit that just comes with palette swaps??? \"It\\'s optional!\" I don\\'t care if it\\'s optional. They should not be charging that much money for outfits. Especially if you want your character to look nice, have a pet, etc. All the good looking cosmetics are locked behind high prices when if you\\'re f2p, you\\'re locked into the basic look. \\n\\nIt\\'s so boring too. Everything, I MEAN EVERYTHING, is slow. I know it\\'s supposed to be relaxing, but this isn\\'t it. Other farming sims have quick animations and are still relaxing. \\n\\nI wanted to try Palia gain because I enjoy decoration. Forget that. Earning money is an awful grind. Unfortunately, a lot of the problems are fundamental stuff. \\n\\nAnd even worse, the world is just....empty. Ruins? Sure. Small little village? Yeah. But it\\'s a bunch of open field with NOTHING! Apparently this is some sort of post apocalyptic world? I\\'ve never found that a good excuse though.\\n\\nOh and the characters. Forget it. The are cringey as all hell and forgettable. \"Wait until you get to know them more!\" No. Good writing is supposed to hook you and make you care about the story and character pretty damn quick. Otherwise, why else am I putting up with this gameplay???\\n\\nOh and even funnier. It won\\'t let me uninstall the damn thing without a workaround when it comes to using their client.

there are women in the game? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you\\'d feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is \"woke\" i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let\\'s get started.\\n\\ni tried this out for a few hours and it was okay gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small (there are TWO areas, your house and the village) and visually it is not very interesting. it is your standard generic fantasy village. the art style and design for the player character is generic too. there\\'s not much to do or work toward in the game because of poor choices i discuss later. it\\'s basically just grind grind grind grind grind and wait wait wait wait.\\nyou can chop down trees, break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops in a very small garden, fish or catch bugs, craft items to decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you\\'ll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers.\\nwhat there is available to do is pretty chill provided you like grinding because that\\'s literally all there is to do in this game, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game\\'s other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there.\\n\\nthe biggest issue, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired, the cosmetics are hideously overpriced ($25+ on the LOW end of things), and there are literally zero free cosmetics or pets in the game outside of the default clothing in the character creator.\\n\\nthe diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game puts the character creator to shame. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. there are no sliders of any kind. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i\\'m basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered in a modern game. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creation options whatsoever.\\ni figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute cosmetics. i was wrong! as i mentioned, you CANNOT obtain any cosmetics! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothes and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color scheme as well. pets are also purchased with real money.\\ni guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money. seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn\\'t tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the key pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely. i am not willing to shell out $20+ on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what\\'s been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics! just because fortnite does it, doesn\\'t mean you should!\\ni exited and uninstalled palia due to my extreme disappointment the moment i figured this out. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this. as i said, it is typically one of the pillars of gameplay in this genre, and one of many different things to work toward in games that are better than palia. without it, the game is severely lacking in things that feel worth striving toward, and i feel no connection to the player character or world. i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that\\'s supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\\nthey seem to think that plushie collecting is enough to make up for the fact that you can only look nice if you want to spend egregious amounts of money... and it\\'s just not...\\n\\ntldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don\\'t want to open your wallet. the gameplay is just grinding or waiting around, and ALL cosmetic items and pets are paid for with real money and are expensive. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit. there are no cosmetics outside of the character creator, which itself is one of the worst character creators i have ever seen. the lack of cosmetics and pets is a huge blow to the game. without them there is not much to work toward. there are also not many other players. you have to wait in line on load screens to enter empty or almost empty servers.\\nif you want to play anyway, be wary about spending real money, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \\n\\nwho knows. with any luck, maybe this will turn into something better at some point in its future, if it has one.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722829071, timestamp_updated=1724302768, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=6, weighted_vote_score=0.5106940865516663, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

Overall, would recommend! :) The scripts of the characters are fun, the voice actors all do a great job bringing life into the game, the concepts are clever, most of the puzzles are rewarding to figure out on the tougher quests (although I wish they'd have some sort of difficulty level feature on quests before you accept them? or a way to refuse quests for the time being.)\\n\\nEdit: I will warn-- the Silverwing Quest with Eloise and Caleri is HARD and FRUSTRATING!

I find many aspects similar to Stardew Valley, but as a third-person RPG? The quests are interesting and there's lots to do. Great for ADHD, if you're prepared to sit down and play a game for hours haha. There are still some glitches, of course, it's the beta version. But to be honest, lots of games release their full versions in worse condition. This game being free is a STEAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the devs and new players, here are some of the glitches I've noticed:\\r\\n- Immediately after closing your inventory or tool selection, you can walk left and right but not forward. This becomes a bit inconvenient when you've chopped down a tree and are trying to switch to your bow. \\r\\n- The game sometimes crashes or the server disconnects (occasionally this is just on my end due to unstable wifi). When this happens, the tutorials are occasionally reset. Turning off tutorials would solve this problem, however, as there is often new content to see/unlock, tutorials are helpful throughout the course of the playthrough (at least where I'm at 30 hours in). So I'd prefer to honestly just click through the tutorials again rather than turn them off, but now I've had to do this 3-4 times. This has happened to my mom as well.\\r\\n- When closing the game, I have to force close it through Steam, which I've noticed when restarting it. It doesn't close despite clicking exit game. It doesn't show up on my hot bar, but steam still says that it's running. This might be an issue on Steams end.\\r\\n- My fish/bug collection broke :(. You can add prize fish and bugs to your plot to display. I guess I added too many, and now only some of my display cases actually show the bug/fish. The rest show the checkered textureless pattern instead. I'm not sure which setting I'd need to turn on to fix that. My fish/bug display was my favourite part of my plot but now it's a bit of a graveyard with only some fish visible among their bretheren, \\r\\n- This is something that is honestly hard to run into so I doubt it will be an issue for most people: if you get kicked out of the game or it crashes outside of the housing plots, where you receive the welcome message from the developers, don't open your inventory. I triggered my inventory tutorial, which asked me to click on something on the screen, but the welcome message from the dev team popped up at the same time. I couldn't interact with either, so had to force shutdown the game. Great way to get stuck, but also a bit funny. Again, probably not likely to happen, but a fun bit of misfortune to share haha.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last suggestion, but when I first started playing I didn't realise I'd be receiving mail from the villagers. Most games have mailboxes as a way to receive update newsletters and messages from the dev team. There's also just so much to check out the mail box was ignored for a bit too long. I know the tutorial mentions that Auni brings the mail every morning, but maybe mentioning in the tutorial that new mail will come in as your relationships with the villagers increases, or having checking the mailbox as a quest objective would help. I know my mom had the same issue where she was struggling with a quest because she didn't know to check the mail box. Now I check it all the time, I love the function! I really love the characters you can meet and interact with in this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nI might come back and review it again once I get farther into the quest lines. So far I'm enjoying it. My mom also plays and she's been enjoying it a lot. I think the characters and relationship developments are my favourite part of the game so far.

      "I have enjoyed this game so much more than I thought. It's nice to play a game that is kind of like Minecraft meets Animal Crossing. I love that I don't have enemies to fight, no one can hurt/hunt me, there is no fall damage, crops don't die if you can't water them right away, and that, so far, everyone has been very helpful and friendly. It's nice to have a pleasant world to escape too. The only downfall....I've done almost all the quests and waiting for more. I'm working to upgrade my skills for now. \n",

      "This game is basically Stardew Valley if it was 3D and had a quarter of the content. You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.\n",

      "- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.\n",

      "- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.\n",

      "My recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon. \n",

      "I really wanted to like Palia, but I couldn't stay excited about it past release. The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \n",
      "There are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They're okay. It's not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn't hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn't hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don't hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don't make it very exciting to play. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn't bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don't feel inviting at all. I can't be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn't well designed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn't enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It's just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don't change, I don't recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \n",

      "Again, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you're making a game and when you're designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it's just not quite enough.

While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying.

      "The game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing.

However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\n",

These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited.

      "Played it on their app instead of steam. I tried to enjoy it. I played it for a good 10 hours. It's not worth it. The premium shop prices are egregious. Upwards of $30-60 for an outfit that just comes with palette swaps??? \"It's optional!\" I don't care if it's optional. They should not be charging that much money for outfits. Especially if you want your character to look nice, have a pet, etc. All the good looking cosmetics are locked behind high prices when if you're f2p, you're locked into the basic look. \n",

      "there is a tldr at the bottom of this review since it is a bit lengthy.\n",
      "i don't usually leave reviews but i was so taken aback by just how poor several key aspects of this game are i feel compelled. you should take any money you might have spent on this game's insanely overpriced cosmetics and find yourself something else. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit in palia. there are plenty of games that do well what palia is attempting and failing to do. it is hard to believe this game had a $50 mil budget and the devs are industry veterans.\n",
      "this studio has gone through massive layoffs a few times and an acquisition recently so this game may not have much time left anyway. reading reviews from people who have been playing since alpha, the devs are also known to be actively hostile toward players and have been on more than one occasion on blog posts and on discord, including threatening to make the game worse on purpose, that's always a good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "it should also be noted i absolutely do not hate this game for being \"woke\" and i, as someone who would be considered \"woke\" through my sheer existence, actually have no idea what so many simpletons in the reviews are referring to as \"woke\" unless they mean the fact that... you can play as a black person? there are women in the game? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you'd feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is \"woke\" i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let's get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "i tried this out for a few hours and it was okay gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small (there are TWO areas, your house and the village) and visually it is not very interesting. it is your standard generic fantasy village. the art style and design for the player character is generic too. there's not much to do or work toward in the game because of poor choices i discuss later. it's basically just grind grind grind grind grind and wait wait wait wait.\n",
      "you can chop down trees, break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops in a very small garden, fish or catch bugs, craft items to decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you'll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers.\n",
      "what there is available to do is pretty chill provided you like grinding because that's literally all there is to do in this game, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game's other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "the biggest issue, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired, the cosmetics are hideously overpriced ($25+ on the LOW end of things), and there are literally zero free cosmetics or pets in the game outside of the default clothing in the character creator.\n",
      "\n",
      "the diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game puts the character creator to shame. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. there are no sliders of any kind. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i'm basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered in a modern game. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creation options whatsoever.\n",
      "i figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute cosmetics. i was wrong! as i mentioned, you CANNOT obtain any cosmetics! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothes and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color scheme as well. pets are also purchased with real money.\n",
      "i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money. seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn't tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the key pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely. i am not willing to shell out $20+ on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what's been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics! just because fortnite does it, doesn't mean you should!\n",
      "i exited and uninstalled palia due to my extreme disappointment the moment i figured this out. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this. as i said, it is typically one of the pillars of gameplay in this genre, and one of many different things to work toward in games that are better than palia. without it, the game is severely lacking in things that feel worth striving toward, and i feel no connection to the player character or world. i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that's supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\n",
      "they seem to think that plushie collecting is enough to make up for the fact that you can only look nice if you want to spend egregious amounts of money... and it's just not...\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don't want to open your wallet. the gameplay is just grinding or waiting around, and ALL cosmetic items and pets are paid for with real money and are expensive. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit. there are no cosmetics outside of the character creator, which itself is one of the worst character creators i have ever seen. the lack of cosmetics and pets is a huge blow to the game. without them there is not much to work toward. there are also not many other players. you have to wait in line on load screens to enter empty or almost empty servers.\n",
      "if you want to play anyway, be wary about spending real money, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \n",

The only problem I have with this game is building. I like the building in this game but I wish they had different grid sizes so that it would be easier to make things even or symmetrical. That is my only problem, and it's not that big of one. It truly doesn't affect game play it just is slightly annoying to me and I'm sure a lot of others, but maybe not. \n",

Great for ADHD, if you're prepared to sit down and play a game for hours haha. There are still some glitches, of course, it's the beta version. But to be honest, lots of games release their full versions in worse condition. This game being free is a STEAL.\n",

      "For the devs and new players, here are some of the glitches I've noticed:\n",
      "- Immediately after closing your inventory or tool selection, you can walk left and right but not forward. This becomes a bit inconvenient when you've chopped down a tree and are trying to switch to your bow. \n",
      "- The game sometimes crashes or the server disconnects (occasionally this is just on my end due to unstable wifi). When this happens, the tutorials are occasionally reset. Turning off tutorials would solve this problem, however, as there is often new content to see/unlock, tutorials are helpful throughout the course of the playthrough (at least where I'm at 30 hours in). So I'd prefer to honestly just click through the tutorials again rather than turn them off, but now I've had to do this 3-4 times. This has happened to my mom as well.\n",
      "- When closing the game, I have to force close it through Steam, which I've noticed when restarting it. It doesn't close despite clicking exit game. It doesn't show up on my hot bar, but steam still says that it's running. This might be an issue on Steams end.\n",
      "- My fish/bug collection broke :(. You can add prize fish and bugs to your plot to display. I guess I added too many, and now only some of my display cases actually show the bug/fish. The rest show the checkered textureless pattern instead. I'm not sure which setting I'd need to turn on to fix that. My fish/bug display was my favourite part of my plot but now it's a bit of a graveyard with only some fish visible among their bretheren, \n",
      "- This is something that is honestly hard to run into so I doubt it will be an issue for most people: if you get kicked out of the game or it crashes outside of the housing plots, where you receive the welcome message from the developers, don't open your inventory. I triggered my inventory tutorial, which asked me to click on something on the screen, but the welcome message from the dev team popped up at the same time. I couldn't interact with either, so had to force shutdown the game. Great way to get stuck, but also a bit funny. Again, probably not likely to happen, but a fun bit of misfortune to share haha.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last suggestion, but when I first started playing I didn't realise I'd be receiving mail from the villagers. Most games have mailboxes as a way to receive update newsletters and messages from the dev team. There's also just so much to check out the mail box was ignored for a bit too long. I know the tutorial mentions that Auni brings the mail every morning, but maybe mentioning in the tutorial that new mail will come in as your relationships with the villagers increases, or having checking the mailbox as a quest objective would help. I know my mom had the same issue where she was struggling with a quest because she didn't know to check the mail box. Now I check it all the time, I love the function! I really love the characters you can meet and interact with in this game. \n",

      "This game has helped me so much recently. After going through a toxic breakup, I started to realize how abusive and controlling the man I was with was. He took advantage of an abused woman and I just loaded the game up and just started to collect items. And boy did my mind calm down and just empty out. I have been playing this game every single day for a week at least now and it's helped me so much keep calm and clear my mind so I can focus on the important things. I would highly suggest this game for anyone. Anyone with anxiety, depression, and dealing with so much horrible things. It can help. So fun, calming and cozy... Though I will say one thing, I'm obsessed with crafting every single furnishing item in the game. Unlocking the rest of the set and then continue on to the next set. Heck I have so much added onto the grand harvest house that I'm not even done yet adding rooms. I'm beyond obsessed with building the most beautiful gorgeous home I can call my own while I find my real one with my kitty cats! \n",

As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice.

I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \\n\\nSecond, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \\n\\nThis format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar.

The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back?

I gave it another try when my daughter had an eye infection and needed antibiotics. The physician advised to apply ice to her eye and go into the doctors office if it got worse, she would not write a prescription. The third time, my daughter had an allergic reaction in her eye with severe swelling, she needed steroids but the physician refused to write a prescription and advised to use otc meds which we had already tried. We ended up having to go to an urgent care and the physician there wrote a prescription for steroids. If you enjoy wasting your time then this app is for you. \n",

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

Update to first review; two days later - I’ve followed her recommendations and used all the OTC products and I’m still sick - zero improvement, some deterioration. I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.

For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store.

      "The app itself is a pretty good concept, however I feel that perhaps some of the doctors they work with could be better? I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab. \n",

My most recent visit, I wasn’t even looking for a prescription or treatment. I sent details and pictures of the area of concern and all I wanted was advice on whether or not I needed to be seen in person. The doctor rudely told me that he couldn’t help because I was treated for the same thing 7 months ago. He said to continue to do the things I was already doing to treat the problem. No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service.

      "First, let me say that I am 100000000% good with the text-based format, because anyone that knows me can tell you that phone calls are the bane of my existence. With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \n",

      "Second, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n",

A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?! \n",

      "Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went.

Honestly this app is just an advertisement for LabCorp/Quest who they’re obviously partnered with because they tried to make me pay for labs or appointments with them every time.

      "I began using the service bc I am an emergency response COVID19 RN responding to overwhelmed hospitals across the country so I needed to find an alternative to traditional urgent/ primary care. I only actually received a treatment plan that matched my chief complaint & symptoms on my 1st visit. I was so impressed I purchased a year subscription which I later discovered had been a huge waste of $$ & my time which I have very little of these days. Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not! It’s just a waste of time and $$ and you will never be bc able to get a refund on your subscription plan that doesn’t actually exist bc the providers only care about making their $$ \n",

      "Doctor ignored my main issue which is coughing. The prescriptions were for sneezing and running nose which I don’t have. I didn’t realize that until late but I think that was because the doctor pushed too fast. Whole visit was done in less than 2 min. Now I’m doubting whether he really read all information I entered before the visit. He didn’t ask anything about any symptoms during the visit so I thought he was sure. Now thinking about it, it felt like he was just giving out suggestions based on computer result which he didn’t even evaluate. I can be wrong and I hope I’m wrong, but my issue was not really addressed and answered. And there’s not an option on the app to make complaints about doctors so I figured they would just expect me to leave a negative feedback so I did.
