      "\n",
      "Upon graduation, Tom began his 26 year career in financial services as a Senior Fixed Income Specialist with McLaughlin, Piven, Vogel, Inc. on Wall Street, later rising to the position of Vice President. Tom left the firm in early 1987 to launch his own independent Wealth Management practice, which he has maintained for a select number of clients for the past 25 years, focusing on retirement planning for the emerging affluent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in 1987, Tom joined Tomorrow’s Financial Services, Inc., now located in Lincroft, NJ, and was instrumental in the formation of its subsidiary broker dealer, TFS Securities, Inc. In 1989, he formed TFS Mortgage Corporation, a Correspondent Residential Mortgage Lender licensed in New Jersey, New York, and Florida. In 1990, TFS Insurance Agency was formed to further expand the insurance business at TFS. In 1995, he started TFS Income Tax Preparation Services to further expand the services of TFS. In 1997, Tom spearheaded the firm’s move into the asset management business with the creation of the Investment Advisory firm now known as TFS Advisory Services. He has served as President of each of these subsidiary companies since their formation, and has served as the President and Chief Marketing Officer for the parent company, Tomorrow’s Financial Services, Inc. since January of 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his tenure, Tom was integral in TFS’ emergence as a leading full-service wealth management and consulting firm, currently managing over 100,000 clients, serviced by 300 independent advisors nationwide. Over the years, he has directly or indirectly recruited, trained, managed and supervised over 500 independent financial advisors. Tom assists in the supervision of a 30 person staff that ensures smooth running back-office operations. He is primarily responsible for new product development, developing strategic alliances, marketing, advertising, firm-level recruitment, and product, sales, and technical training. Under his direction, the TFS sales force has grown 1000%, while production has increased 2500%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom holds the FINRA Series 7, 63, 24, 27, 65, 53, & 79 registrations. He holds insurance producer licenses for Life, Health, Property & Casualty, and Annuities in NJ and at least 30 other states. He also holds the Mortgage Banker, Secondary Mortgage Banker, and Mortgage Originator licenses in NJ, NY and FL. Tom has appeared as an expert witness in numerous legal cases involving the financial services industry and is a frequent keynote speaker.

      "\n",
      "A Partner for Today — and Tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "Chances are, you talk to your clients about their long-term goals — and how the choices they make today have a powerful impact on the life they live tomorrow. Every day, you help them seize the opportunities that will bring their dreams to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you doing the same for your own career?\n",
      "\n",
      "With TFS, you can find true independence, long-term growth and the support you need. Unlike firms who offer big signing bonuses that come with even bigger strings attached, we will be your ally and advocate for the rest of your career. Our team will help you become each client’s primary trusted advisor, the person they turn to whenever they have a question or concern in their financial life.\n",

      "\n",
      "At TFS, you are free to run your practice your way. From market niche and revenue style to office location and hiring choices, you maintain control. And, you will never have to push proprietary products or meet sales quotas, so you can focus on your clients’ best interests, rather than corporate demands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent Compensation\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Supportive Compliance\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, our compliance team is here to protect your practice without holding you back. We know you need to connect with clients and prospects — but at many firms, compliance can be so bureaucratic and oppressive that it feels like sales prevention. So, we bring a collaborative, supportive perspective to our reviews, and work one-on-one with advisors to make intelligent business decisions while ensuring suitable and appropriate recommendations for our clients.\n",
