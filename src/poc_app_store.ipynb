Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

Let me just say that this is where technology draws the line - getting healthcare over text (which is their primary communication method) seems ineffective. For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store. I would only recommend this as a resource to get general questions answered about health, not to receive treatment.\n",

I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap.

I searched for support and left 2-messages, at non-human alternatives, unable to start a session because the app doesn’t allow you to progress until your profile contains your pharmacy preference. 4-hours later, miraculously, the app let me choose a pharmacy. From there I submitted my medical issue. The doctor was very kind and supportive but couldn’t help me a bit because not only could she NOT prescribe scheduled medicines by a required tele-visit, she couldn’t submit the prescription to a pharmacy without an approval to submit electronically. I wasted the entire time and effort from the beginning moment I believed this app was a solution. PROCEED WITH CAUTION; READ EVERYTHING; I DID AND SEE WHERE I LANDED?\n",

The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.\n",

I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked.

I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n",

      "Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \n",

I was so impressed I purchased a year subscription which I later discovered had been a huge waste of $$ & my time which I have very little of these days. Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not!

Now I’m doubting whether he really read all information I entered before the visit. He didn’t ask anything about any symptoms during the visit so I thought he was sure. Now thinking about it, it felt like he was just giving out suggestions based on computer result which he didn’t even evaluate. I can be wrong and I hope I’m wrong, but my issue was not really addressed and answered.
