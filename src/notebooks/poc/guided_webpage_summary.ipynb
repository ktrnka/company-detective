      "Three years ago, I met a brilliant woman named Elizabeth Simmons, founder and CEO of The Doula Network, a national network of doulas providing physical, emotional, and educational support to people across the country. I had heard of her because our customers raved about The Doula Network and the outstanding community-based support they provided. Naturally, we had quite a lot to talk about.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we chatted about Pomelo’s evidence-based, virtual care model, The Doula Network’s community-based, in-person approach, and the rapidly changing landscape around health plans and doula coverage, it was clear we had a unique opportunity in front of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings us to today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am incredibly proud to announce that Pomelo Care has acquired The Doula Network. We are merging our models to create a first for maternity care in the United States: a national hybrid virtual and in-person care model designed to significantly expand access to high-quality maternity care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Unique Impact of Doulas\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a national maternity care emergency in the United States. The statistics are appalling: 1 in 10 babies born in the US today is admitted to a NICU, 1 in 8 births occur in counties with low or no access to maternal care, more than a third of counties are maternity care deserts, maternal morbidity rates are higher than peer countries and there are vast, unacceptable disparities in outcomes for women of color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2021, Pomelo has provided medical care for women during preconception, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and for both mother and infant during their infant’s first year. The Pomelo approach consists of virtual, round-the-clock care delivered by a dedicated team of obstetric and pediatric clinicians, midwives, nurses, dietitians, therapists, and lactation experts who ensure the patient and her baby have the best possible health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the addition of The Doula Network, patients may also now be partnered with a community-based doula who will provide consequential support to patients throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. In addition to providing in-person support, the doulas will become active members of a patient’s virtual care team, and together they will address key medical, behavioral and social factors to improve outcomes for mom, baby, and family.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why is doula care so important?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is extensive research showing doula care improves maternity outcomes and health equity, particularly among Black mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to high-risk pregnant patients who do not receive doula care, patients under doula care during labor and delivery are 2 times less likely to have a birth complication, 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, 40% less likely to have a cesarean delivery, and experience lower rates of preterm birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the March of Dimes, they also experience shorter time in labor, fewer negative childbirth experiences, less anxiety and depression, and are more likely to breastfeed. And importantly, they are more likely to feel happy about the care they received.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doula Network has shown meaningful improvements in key measures of maternal and infant health across their populations, with a 19% cesarean section rate reduction compared to the national average and a 36% low birthweight rate reduction compared to the national average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple fact is: doulas improve outcomes, lower costs, and reduce disparities. Pomelo Care’s patients will benefit greatly from their addition to our team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rapidly Growing Demand\n",
      "\n",
      "While the impact of doulas is clear, only 6% of women in the United States currently have coverage for doula care. Historically, health plans have not covered doula services and it has remained largely a cash-pay industry, which can cost several hundred or even several thousand dollars for patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doula coverage has remained limited. According to the Washington Post, “For ab...\n",

      "At Pomelo, we are scaling a virtual value-based maternity care model to improve access, reduce disparities, and eliminate healthcare gaps for families nationwide. We constantly use data to better understand our patients' needs and behaviors, make our clinicians more efficient, and measure our impact on outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat down with Sherry, a data scientist, to learn more about what makes Pomelo's data team unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did you decide to join Pomelo?\n",
      "\n",
      "In college, I learned about data science through my interest in public policy and civic technology. I discovered a community tackling problems to improve people's lives, from replacing lead pipes to improving access to government benefits and using data to design more efficient and scalable solutions. Over the years, I sought out roles where I could work on challenging, high-impact problems, wear many different hats, and be on teams with smart, thoughtful people.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I learned that Pomelo was building a scalable way to improve maternal health outcomes, my initial reaction was, \"How does this not already exist?\" I was excited to join a company with an ambitious, impactful mission and so many opportunities to use data to help drive its success.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the data team at Pomelo operate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Every company says data is core to its work, but data is genuinely core to how every function at Pomelo operates. We use data to identify eligible patients, understand patient risk factors and prior medical history, and measure the success of our interventions in engaging patients and improving outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Insights team comprises data scientists, software engineers, data engineers, and product managers and supports the business's data needs. As our company and priorities have changed over time, the problems we focus on and the tools we use have evolved, too. As we navigate this change, our team follows a few important, constant principles –\n",
      "\n",
      "We invest in centralizing our data and building core data models. Before I joined Pomelo, the team invested in storing all patient health information in a centralized FHIR store, a data standard that we use as the source of truth for every Pomelo patient's health history. We also set up a centralized data warehouse for storing data on everything from clinical interactions and outcomes to marketing and patient engagement. Finally, we continuously build dbt models that standardize and transform data on key entities that we then use as the starting point for more complex analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We make analytics-ready data accessible across the whole company. With a small data team and a very data-driven culture, there are more daily data requests than we could handle if we completed each one ourselves. So, we use a BI tool that enables anyone at Pomelo to easily modify dashboards and charts (or build their own!). Stakeholders can view key metrics, answer ad-hoc questions, and form hypotheses. Making analytics self-service enables teams to get answers to their data questions faster and allows the data team to focus on building scalable, self-service data products and tackling new, more complex challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "We work directly with other functions to understand challenges and design solutions. Every data scientist knows that working cross-functionally is part of the job. At Pomelo, we collaborate with stakeholders across teams every day. The data team joins early discussions in new problem areas to gather context before building a solution. We shadow and ask our nurses, providers, and specialists questions when solving patient care problems. Data science at Pomelo goes beyond building dashboards and reports – we scope pilots and implement new solutions to address challenges from patient outreach to engagement to outcomes measurement.\n",

      "I started my career in a basement room at a state Medicaid agency designing an alternative payment model for maternity care. As I dug through claims and set quality measure benchmarks, I didn’t realize the evidence of a national maternal health crisis was buried in those countless lines of data. Today, pregnancy complications remain on the rise, with one in ten newborns starting their life in the NICU and cesarean births increasing 41% over the last two decades. Even more stunning, the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is more than three times the rate in most other high-income countries, with BIPOC women 2-3x more likely than white women to die from such complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years later, when I had my daughter, Mia, and son, Luka, I experienced a preeclampsia scare, emergency room visits, and a large for gestational age baby. With only a few minutes a month with my OB/GYN, I faced these challenges with many more questions than answers. Millions of other women face similar and more daunting issues — patients like Shelly, one of Pomelo's patients who was gracious enough to share her story with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shelly was overjoyed to become a first time mom at 43 after trying to conceive for many years, but she faced some unexpected complications. Gallstones sent her to the emergency room, where doctors advised her to cut all fat from her diet to prevent them from coming back. She left feeling confused and limited as to what she could eat. Shelly also risked developing gestational diabetes, which increases the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. Overwhelmed, she hit dead ends looking for answers on Google despite wanting to make changes to keep herself and her baby healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started Pomelo Care to help people like Shelly – and families all across the country — have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We designed our approach around three core tenets:\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to increase access to care, close care gaps, and reduce the friction of getting care for families – we’re available 24/7 with expert maternal and pediatric care teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many pregnancy risk factors are known and addressable – we created data infrastructure to identify these risks earlier by analyzing claims, lab, pharmacy, and electronic health record data, and we surface patient needs to clinicians in real-time via our software platform so a holistic care team can address these risks by treating medical, behavioral, and social needs in concert.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need a value-based care model that improves outcomes for both mother and baby – we are laser focused on delivering evidence-based care that improves outcomes and reduces costs from avoidable complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "From my early work in Medicaid to my own pregnancies, to conversations I’ve had with clinical leaders in our field, I’ve long been frustrated by poor access to care, late or no identification and management of risk factors, and the lack of a value-based payment model to change the status quo. So that’s what we’ve built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pomelo Care is a virtual, multi-speciality medical practice that uses a value-based care model to address underlying risk factors to improve maternal and newborn health. We provide 24/7 virtual care for patients from preconception until their baby turns one. Our team of OB/GYN, primary care, and pediatric clinicians, mental health therapists, social workers, dietitians, lactation consultants, and other experts care for the whole person. By proactively identifying and treating individual risk factors wherever a patient is – in their life and in the country – we aim to give everyone the personalized, holistic care previously only available to a select few. And we partner with health plans to deliver this care at no cost to patients.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of my first projects at Pomelo was actually born out of a mini-hackathon at our company-wide offsite. My team’s hack used GPT-4 to enable efficient and comprehensive clinical documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I worked with one of our clinicians, Kat, to build a feature that leveraged generative AI to automatically create summaries based on recent clinical interactions. After an impactful demo at the hackathon, I was able to spend the rest of the quarter developing and launching the feature. It’s been a huge win for patients and clinicians alike. Our patients are heard, and their whole care team has the full context on their care needs and goals. Our clinicians can focus on delivering care, rather than documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really proud of this collaboration between engineering and clinical teams. As a more junior engineer, it was super rewarding for me to have led the project end-to-end, working cross-functionally to deliver meaningful improvements for our team and our patients.\n",

      "What makes the Pomelo engineering team special?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most unique things about my day-to-day is how closely I work alongside our clinicians. Engineers regularly shadow clinicians to understand product pain points, and see firsthand how this impacts clinicians’ workflows. This direct feedback channel allows us to quickly iterate on meaningful product improvements.\n",

When Ava’s Pomelo nurse checked in a couple days later to see if she had started her daily aspirin regimen, Ava said she hadn't because she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket cost. Her care team quickly jumped into action to find a bottle of 100 low-dose aspirin for $4 at a local store. Ava started taking low-dose aspirin and stuck with it – significantly reducing her risk of developing preeclampsia. She avoided preeclampsia altogether and delivered at term, with no NICU stay.\n",
