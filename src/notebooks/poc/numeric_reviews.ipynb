Costs, Benefits and Options by Jess Mathews on 2024-02-19](https://www.aplaceformom.com/senior-living)\\nSenior living encompasses a range of housing and care options for older adults, from senior apartments and independent living communities for active seniors to nursing homes for those with significant medical needs. Determining who needs senior living and what type of community they should live in depends on how much care they need:\\n\\nSenior apartments and independent living communities: The senior meets community age requirements and doesn’t need any care services.\\n\\nHome care and assisted living communities: The senior needs help with a couple of activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing and eating, but is otherwise independent.\\n\\nMemory care: The senior has symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, and they need help with ADLs.\\n\\nNursing homes: The senior needs skilled medical care for short-term or long-term conditions.\\n\\nThe costs and amenities of each community usually depend on the level of care provided and whether or not residents are given a maintenance-free, all-inclusive experience. Each senior living option is detailed below to help you find the best community for your needs.\\n\\nTypically, the more specialized a senior living option is, the more it will cost. For example, nursing homes remain the most expensive senior living option while offering the highest level of care possible outside of a hospital setting. Other features like location, care type, floor plan, services and amenities, and pricing model will affect the monthly cost of senior care.\\n\\nKnowing what real families paid for care options can help you better plan for care and understand your budget. Below, you’ll see the monthly median senior living costs across the nation based on data from A Place for Mom’s 2024 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\\n\\nWhen it comes time to cover the costs of senior care, families use both private and public pay options. Private payment methods include using funds from personal accounts, retirement savings, social security, and insurance. Some families may use public pay options, like Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans benefits.\\n\\nFinding the right senior living option comes down to three questions: What are your needs, what are your retirement goals, and what is your budget? Knowing the answer to these questions should help you narrow down which option will fit your family’s needs best. For example, if your loved one doesn’t require care services, but wants to pursue new hobbies and make new friendships, independent living might be a better option than a senior apartment or assisted living environment.\\n\\nAbove all else, the best way to determine which senior living option is best is to tour. Touring allows families to meet community staff and residents, ask questions, evaluate floor plans, and truly get a sense of what life in that community would look like. According to our data, 97% of families tour before making a final decision about their senior living options.\\n\\nMoving can be a big adjustment, which is why it’s best to plan ahead. Consider the significant change you or a senior loved one will go through. A successful move is key for a positive transition into a new environment and lifestyle.\\n\\nBelow are some top tips for an easy senior living move:\\n\\nChoose one room at a time for packing and downsizing.\\n\\nConsider hiring a professional senior relocation service.\\n\\nWork with a geriatric care manager to make sure there is e access to health care providers and prescriptions after the move.\\n\\nConsider mobility needs to find the best way to travel, whether by car or plane.', '# [What Is Memory Care? Services, Cost, and Benefits by seanleong on 2024-02-09](https://www.aplaceformom.com/alzheimers-care)\\nMemory care is a type of long-term care community designed to meet the specific needs of individuals with a dementia diagnosis, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. Memory care facilities offer 24-hour care and supervision, secured environments, specialized staff trained in dementia care, and memory-enhancing activities and therapies. Memory care can take place in apartment-like facilities, within a wing of an assisted living facility, or in smaller residential care homes. The goal of memory care is to provide an engaging, safe, and therapeutic environment for seniors with dementia to support their well-being and improve their quality of life. Individuals in the middle to later stages of dementia benefit most from a memory care environment.\\n\\nBenefits of memory care\\n\\nBecause dementia symptoms worsen over time, elderly adults with dementia are often unable to continue to live independently in their homes. If a family member is unable to take on the caregiver role, which can quickly become a full-time job, memory care is a great option. Memory care not only benefits seniors with dementia but also families who are feeling overwhelmed by their loved one’s advanced care needs. It gives families peace of mind that their loved one is in a secure and therapeutic environment with caregivers trained to handle difficult dementia behaviors.\\n\\nRead on to learn all about memory care benefits, specialized services, costs, and payment options. We also offer free tips on finding and moving to a community in your area.\\n\\nThe median national cost of memory care is $6,200 per month, according to proprietary data gathered by A Place for Mom. Costs vary greatly between communities and depend on factors like location, community amenities, programming, apartment size, and the level of care a senior requires. Pricing models also vary. For instance, some memory care communities may be all-inclusive, while others may use an a la carte approach and charge based on services required by a resident.\\n\\nMemory care base costs typically cover rent, utilities, meals and snacks, housekeeping, transportation to medical appointments, on-site activities, nonmedical therapies, and shared amenities. However, some amenities — such as in-unit internet service, beauty and barber services, laundry, and pet accommodations — may cost extra.\\n\\nWhile many families look to savings to finance senior care, there are other little-known funding sources that can help. The articles below can help you better understand pricing and the options available to help pay for memory care.', '# [What is a Nursing Home? Services, Cost and Options by Grace Hobson on 2024-02-26](https://www.aplaceformom.com/nursing-homes)\\nNursing homes, also called skilled nursing facilities, provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for seniors. Nursing homes offer the highest level of care for seniors who need long-term or short-term medical care but don’t need hospitalization. Elderly adults who need long-term care at a nursing home often have severe physical or cognitive health conditions that require 24-hour nursing care. They may be incontinent, unable to eat independently, or unable to transfer from bed to a wheelchair without the assistance of a staff member.\\n\\nNursing homes play a crucial role in post-hospitalization care. They offer short-term rehabilitation for seniors recovering from illnesses, accidents or surgery. Rehab care focuses on restoring mobility, strength, and function so seniors can get back to their normal activities.\\n\\nNursing homes provide a distinctly higher level of medical care than other types of senior living, such as independent living, assisted living, and memory care. Nursing homes can also be called “care homes,” “skilled rehab facilities,” or “long-term care facilities.”\\n\\nFinding a nursing home for your loved one may feel overwhelming. You may have many different facilities to choose from, so how do you know which one is right? Start with your family member’s prioritized needs and consider the facility’s medical services and ratings.\\n\\nUltimately, there’s no substitute for visiting and experiencing a typical day at the nursing home. As you tour different facilities, be sure to ask whether the nursing home you’re visiting is Medicare or Medicaid certified and licensed if you plan on using your benefits to help cover your care costs there. You can also check the facility’s rating on the Medicare website.\\n\\nUse these resources to discover what to look for when searching for a nursing home and how to find the best nursing homes near you.', '# [](https://reputationportal.aplaceformom.com/)\\n', '# [Assisted Living & Memory Care](https://www.aplaceformom.com/community/riverbend-96661)\\nLovely, Craftsman exteriors and cozy, home-like decor welcome you at Riverbend, where we offer assisted living and memory care services in Jeffersonville, Indiana.

We also offer podiatry, dentistry, audiology, and optical services on-site.

Our review scores prioritize reviews that are recent — the past 24 months — because we know families need current information when choosing senior care.\\n\\nThose with many recent, positive reviews receive a high review score, while providers with few recent reviews — regardless of how positive — receive a lower review score. Communities with no recent reviews will not have a review score, even if older reviews are positive. The maximum A Place for Mom review score a community can receive is 10 points.', '# [111 Communities](https://www.aplaceformom.com/providers/atria-21)\\nAtria Del Rey Rancho Cucamonga\\n\\nWhen I was given the tour of Atria Del Rey, I knew this would be the place for my mom.

If I ever need assistant living in the future, I hope to be at Atria Del Rey. The facility is beyond nice and the care is top notch.

Unfortunately, my Mom was only there for 5 days, so she did not really use food and activities. She was very well taken care of. Even though the facility is older, it is very clean and well maintained. The staff, from director to nursing to admin and support seem to be one happy family caring for the residents. Some residents, I learned, have been there for many years.\\n\\nFinal move from a lifetime in California,\\n\\nAfter deciding that a senior living home would best suit my needs and desires at this time in my life (I\\'m 87 years old), I first started visiting senior facilities in California where I was born, raised and lived most of my life.

I visited a grandson and his family in Holly Springs, North Carolina over the Christmas holidays and visited some facilities that I had researched online prior to my arrival. When I walked into Atria Cary, I immediately knew this would be my home. The location and beauty of the facility, friendliness of the staff, wonderful apartments, activities galore, entertainment, delicious restaurant style served meals, exercise room with gym equipment and classes, a huge heated pool room with water aerobics classes, art room with classes, billiards, card games, puzzle tables, etc., planned trips,and a staff of physical and occupational therapy professionals for those in need of their services.\\n\\nThe facility.\\n\\nThe facility is very nice they do a lot of different activities for the residents they cater to the residents they do the one on one personal care with them they make sure they will taken care of.

Initially, he was very reluctant and scared about the transition, but the staff has been so communicative and responsive, getting to know him on a personal level and helping him settle in. The change in him has been remarkable—his cognitive abilities, which had been declining since my mother passed a year ago, have stabilized, and he’s starting to show signs of his old self again. It’s been heartwarming to see. The front desk staff is equally wonderful, always personable and pleasant, and they keep me well-informed about my dad’s day-to-day experiences. It’s reassuring to know that he’s in a place where people genuinely care for him and are committed to making sure he’s comfortable, safe, and happy. I’m incredibly grateful to The Atria for everything they’ve done.\\n\\nNeeded Respite Care w/ Immediate Move In\\n\\nMy mom needed respite care after a fall and surgery which landed her in a wheelchair for about 6 weeks. Her home isn’t wheelchair accessible. [name removed] was extremely helpful at helping us to get mom moved in 3 days later. The staff was welcoming and very helpful during the move- in process. She moved into a studio apartment with her own bathroom. Atria has a very warm and friendly environment. The property is clean, beautiful, and to walk around. There is large dining room that serves restaurant style meals, or dine-in room is an option. Lots of fun activities to join. Transportation to local stores. Amazing staff that are ready to help if or when you need it. Atria feels like one big extended family.\\n\\nGreat respite experience\\n\\nLast winter I stayed at Atria Woodbriar Park for 4 months as I recovered from ankle surgery. The staff and other residents made the experience so much better than I expected. Everyone was friendly and I received the help I needed. As someone used to living independently it was quite a change for me. The pool helped my rehab tremendously and it was such an accomplishment when I could get in and out on my own instead of being lifted in and out!\\n\\nBest decision I\\'ve made.\\n\\nWe moved my parents to Atria WoodBriar Park recently from another retirement community. The warm and welcoming atmosphere at Atria Woodbriar Park and the beautiful surroundings made our decision. I can’t say enough about how thankful I am for their patience and guidance. The staff was invaluable during the transition. My parents settled in right away. The sense of community and a wonderful engaging staff create a home-like environment, unlike other places we toured. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking.', \"# [Ebenezer Senior Living](https://www.aplaceformom.com/providers/ebenezer-655)\\nA great fit for mom\\n\\nMy mother loves it there and we have been impressed with their all around customer service. For our mother, walking into Champlin Shores felt like home. It wasn't too big, it wasn't too small. The vibe in the lobby area was that people enjoyed visiting with each other, and if you were to stop in at any given time, they usually are a few people down there to socialize. The staff have always been very friendly. We have had a few meals with our mother, the food was well prepared and tasteful. By the end of the first week, all the staff knew my mother's name, and called her by name when speaking with her. For us, Champlin Shores has been the perfect fit for our mothers next home.\\n\\nJob well done\\n\\nI would start off with a tour and a meeting with the community director.

They also have birthday parties for everyone in the unit.\\n\\nHighly recommend\\n\\nWe chose Oak Meadows because they had everything we were looking for. It is such a welcoming atmosphere when you walk in and the price was right. The staff are over the top incredible. The apartment sizes are very nice and perfect for what they need. They absolutely love it here and I would highly recommend them.\\n\\nI would recommend\\n\\nWe chose Trail of Orono because of the location, the facility itself, and the staff members really sold us. The room sizes are pretty standard compared to others that we looked into. They do have a lot of activities they do with the residents. They are truly willing to work with families to make sure you are comfortable and are great with communication. I would recommend them.\\n\\nHighly recommend\\n\\nWe chose Trails of Orono because of the location to family as well as the fact that it is a smaller community, so it is more home like rather than institutional. I have also heard good things from friends with loved ones here so they have a good reputation. They email us with any updates and have been great with communication, I have been impressed. Using the primary care physicians that are brought in has made coordination of care so much easier. It has been a great experience so far and I would recommend them.\\n\\nGood so far\\n\\nSo far so good! :) Mom and Dad have only been there a few months but it has been wonderful. So much to do for them, good food, Lots of activities, very nice staff. I like the fact that it is so bright and beautiful place.\\n\\nTop Notch.\\n\\nTrails is a fantastic place.

I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking a home like feel. We love the privacy we get with the individual units and plenty of space. Food is great, staff is very friendly, very clean and plenty of space to spread out.\\n\\nGood place for mom\\n\\nMy mother is a new resident and loves her apartment and this community.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, offers benefits for those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces, including Aid and Attendance and Housebound benefits, which provide financial assistance for long-term care.\\n\\nSadly, many veterans are completely unaware of the benefits available to them — and that means some veterans are paying more for their care than they should. A Place for Mom has helped guide more than 410,000 veterans in their searches for senior care and housing. Part of this assistance involves making veterans and their families aware of benefits that they have earned, but may not know about. This complete guide to VA benefits for long-term care covers who qualifies for benefits, the types of benefits available to help pay for long-term care, and how to apply for veterans benefits.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nWho qualifies for VA benefits?\\n\\nGenerally, the following military connected individuals may be eligible for VA benefits:\\n\\nDisabled or ill veterans\\n\\nWartime veterans\\n\\nVeterans with recognized toxic exposures\\n\\nOther veterans\\n\\nVeteran spouses\\n\\nSurviving spouses\\n\\nSurviving children\\n\\nOther veteran dependents\\n\\nVA long-term care eligibility requirements\\n\\nVA long-term care benefit programs vary, and each come with specific requirements that must be met for people to qualify. Depending on the specific VA benefit program a senior is applying for, requirements can include considerations of the following:\\n\\nU.S. military service history\\n\\nNumber of days on active duty\\n\\nAge of the veteran\\n\\nWartime service specifics\\n\\nCharacter of discharge\\n\\nNecessity of a caregiver’s assistance to complete activities of daily living\\n\\nClinical assessments and diagnoses\\n\\nFinancial need or low-income status\\n\\nMental or physical disabilities\\n\\nStatus as a surviving dependent family member\\n\\nMarriage or familial relation to a veteran\\n\\nIn addition, veterans typically can’t have committed an act that constitutes a statutory bar from VA benefits, such as desertion, being a conscientious objector, or going on absence without official leave (AWOL), according to the VA.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVeterans benefits can cover the cost of long-term care\\n\\nMany veterans benefits, like the VA Pension, the Aid and Attendance benefit, and the Housebound allowance, can be used to help cover the costs of long-term care. The Aid and Attendance benefit is most generous and can help with monthly costs of living for seniors, including those looking to live a private senior living community.\\n\\nVeterans benefits can vary greatly from person to person. For example, one person’s VA Pension stipend may be more generous than another’s. What a veteran or dependent is awarded depends on the many requirement details listed in the section above. It’s important to first identify which programs your loved one might qualify for to see what they could potentially receive.\\n\\nRead on for some VA programs that many senior veterans or their families utilize to improve their overall quality of life.\\n\\nVA Pension and Survivors Pension\\n\\nThe VA provides supplemental income to veterans and their families through the Veterans Pension and Survivors Pension benefit programs. These tax-free benefits are paid monthly and available to eligible U.S. military veterans or their surviving dependents, respectively. These VA Pensions are based on need and benefit amounts change each year based on that year’s Maximum Annual Pension Rates (or MAPR). What a beneficiary receives depends on their eligibility as well as their countable income. View the latest Veterans Pension rates and Survivors Pensions rates online, and learn how monthly stipends are calculated.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that the Veterans Pension is separate from a U.S. military pension. However, money from a military pension can also be used to pay for costs related to long-term care.\\n\\nIf your loved one qualifies for a VA Pension, they may also be eligible for add-on VA benefits that can help pay for senior care, such as the Aid and Attendance benefit or Housebound allowance.\\n\\nAid and Attendance\\n\\nThe VA Aid and Attendance benefit provides supplemental income for eligible veterans and surviving spouses who already receive the VA Pension and require senior care either at home or at a senior living facility. If your loved one is unable to live independently, is blind, or needs help with some of their activities of daily living (ADLs), they may qualify for the Aid and Attendance. Aid and Attendance pays a monthly amount that’s added to the VA Pension or Survivors Pension and can help pay for senior care and costs of living.\\n\\nHousebound allowance\\n\\nThe VA Housebound allowance is for veterans and eligible dependents who spend most of their time at home because of a permanent disability. People who qualify for the Housebound allowance are confined to their home or need the assistance when leaving their home for medical appointments or medically necessary treatments.\\n\\nVA disability compensation\\n\\nVeterans who became sick or injured during their service, or who had a medical condition that worsened due to their service, may be able to receive specialized support through VA disability compensation. Unlike many other VA benefits, this benefit is not based upon financial need.\\n\\nVeterans may spend this funding at their discretion, which means it can be used for senior living expenses if a veteran so chooses. See the latest VA disability compensation payment amounts online.\\n\\nVA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)\\n\\nSurviving dependents or parents of deceased veterans, who passed away from a service-connected medical condition or who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, may be able to receive support through the VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefit, also known as DIC. Not all survivors may qualify for the DIC benefit, but those that do may receive monthly tax-free payments.\\n\\nThese payments can be spent at the discretion of the survivor, including paying for long-term care expenses. View the latest VA DIC rates online to see what survivors may qualify for.\\n\\nVA Health Care\\n\\nEligible veterans enrolled in VA Health Care may receive long-term care services through the VA. Some covered long-term care services under VA Health Care may include the following:\\n\\nPhysical therapy\\n\\n24/7 nursing and medical care\\n\\nPalliative care\\n\\nHospice care\\n\\nRespite care\\n\\nIn-home primary care\\n\\nCommunity care\\n\\nAssistance with activities of daily living, such as dressing or bathing\\n\\nPain management\\n\\nVA health benefits may be received in a variety of settings, which may be run by the VA or community providers. Depending on the availability of services in your loved one’s area, community care settings may include:\\n\\nA veteran’s residence\\n\\nAssisted living communities\\n\\nAdult day health centers\\n\\nNursing homes\\n\\nVA Community Living Centers (VA Nursing Homes)\\n\\nThe VA operates more than 100 VA Community Living Centers nationwide. These are nursing homes that can provide eligible veterans with 24-hour skilled nursing care, mental health resources, specialized dementia care, and more, depending on the community.\\n\\nWhile this nursing home care isn’t necessarily free, qualified veterans may find these communities to be a more affordable option. Copays may be charged to some veterans. A veteran’s service-connected disability status and financial need may be considered when it comes to fees at these VA Community Living Centers.\\n\\nVeteran dependents and surviving family members typically can’t access home health care services through VA Community Living Centers. However, seniors may be able to use other VA benefits to pay for long-term home health care in the setting of their choice, like at home or in a private assisted living, independent living, or memory care community.\\n\\nVA State Home Per Diem Program\\n\\nEligible veterans may be able to reside in a State Veterans Home, a state-operated senior living community designed for military-connected individuals. Veterans who choose to reside in these communities may be able to receive support for their care through the VA State Home Per Diem Program.\\n\\nWhile individual situations may vary, the VA generally pays a per diem rate for qualified veterans to reside in State Veterans Homes. However, other fees or expenses may still exist.\\n\\nSome State Veterans Homes may admit non-veteran spouses or Gold Star parents, which are parents of a fallen service member. However, the VA State Home Per Diem Program typically doesn’t pay for the long-term care of non-veterans at these communities.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA benefit payment amounts\\n\\nIt’s exceptionally challenging to calculate an exact amount that a veteran, veteran dependent, or family member may receive from the VA for long-term care. Award amounts may vary based on where the veteran, survivor, or dependent lands with the following:\\n\\nDisability rating\\n\\nUnique health needs\\n\\nAssistance required for activities of daily living\\n\\nNumber of dependents\\n\\nIf the veteran is married to another veteran, also known as a dual-veteran couple or dual-military couple\\n\\nThe specific programs and benefits the veteran participates in\\n\\nHowever, we can look at general rates for the following programs. Keep in mind that a variety of factors determine the actual payment your loved one may receive. As mentioned previously, MAPR refers to the Maximum Annual Pension Rate allowed for a specific year.\\n\\nPension rates for veterans\\n\\nFor each additional dependent, add an annual benefit of $2,743 with a monthly rate of $228 to your loved one’s MAPR amount.\\n\\nPension rates for spouses\\n\\nFor each additional dependent, add an annual benefit of $2,743 with a monthly rate of $228 to your love one’s MAPR amount.\\n\\nVA disability compensation rates\\n\\nDisability ratingMonthly payment, veteran alone10%$165.9220%$327.9930%$508.0540%$731.8650%$1,041.8260%$1,319.6570%$1,663.0680%$1,933.1590%$2,172.39100%$3,621.95\\n\\nVA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) rate\\n\\nThe DIC program follows a complex set to determine overall payment amount. Payments vary based on individual circumstance. For example, if you’re a surviving spouse of a veteran who dies on or after January 1, 1993, you could be eligible $1,612.75 per month. There may be additional amounts added on if a surviving spouse has a disability or children under the age of 18.\\n\\nHow are VA benefits for senior care paid?\\n\\nVA benefits are deposited directly to the bank account of the veteran or surviving spouse each month. If your loved one doesn’t have a bank account but wishes to receive their payment through direct deposit, there are veteran-friendly banks and credit unions that can help them qualify for an account or get one set up.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA long-term care benefits: Coverage by type\\n\\nWhile the VA benefits and programs vary, eligible veterans, dependents, and surviving family members may receive support to help with long-term care expenses related to the following:\\n\\nAssisted living\\n\\nIndependent living\\n\\nIn-home care\\n\\nFamily caregiving\\n\\nSkilled nursing care\\n\\nNursing home options\\n\\nMemory care\\n\\nFor more personalized support, advice, and explanation of senior care options, reach out to A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors.\\n\\nVeterans benefits for assisted living\\n\\nAssisted living facilities provide long-term housing and care for seniors. Older adults in assisted living are generally active but may need help with certain activities, such as bathing or dressing, throughout the day. Assisted living facilities also offer nutritious meals, housekeeping, and social activities in a senior-friendly environment.\\n\\nAssisted living costs vary based on the facility location, amenities, size of apartment, and level of care needed. However, the median monthly cost of assisted living in the U.S. is about $4,807, according to A Place for Mom’s 2023 Cost of Long-Term Care and Senior Living Report.\\n\\nIf your family member qualifies for the Aid and Attendance benefits, they may receive a supplemental monthly amount to offset the cost of care at an assisted living facility, as long as care at the facility includes help with activities of daily living.\\n\\nVeterans benefits for memory care\\n\\nMemory care, sometimes called Alzheimer’s care, is for seniors who have Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia. These residential facilities cater to the unique needs of seniors with memory loss. The Aid and Attendance may be an important benefit to help those eligible pay for care in one of these communities.\\n\\nMemory care facilities are distinct form of assisted living and provide a safe environment for those suffering with memory loss. On-site services include prepared meals, medication management, personal care, occupational therapy, music therapy, and other memory-enhancing activities and therapies.\\n\\nHere are a few more features of memory care communities:\\n\\nFacilities are often designed to reduce confusion and prevent wandering.\\n\\nMemory care staff members are trained in specialized memory care techniques and provide 24-hour supervision with a focus on improving the quality of life of residents.\\n\\nMost memory care communities offer person-centered dementia care.\\n\\nThe median cost of memory care is $5,995 per month, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners. However, this may vary based on facility location, amenities, and the level of care provided.\\n\\nVeterans benefits for nursing home care\\n\\nNursing home care is for seniors who are seriously ill or have a severe health condition, or for those recovering from an illness or injury after a hospital stay. Veteran residents of a nursing home facility may qualify for the Aid and Attendance financial assistance.\\n\\nNursing homes provide 24-hour nursing and personal care for elderly adults who need a high level of nursing and medical care but don’t need to be in a hospital. In addition to meals, housekeeping, and social activities, nursing home care can include the following:\\n\\nSkilled nursing care\\n\\n24/7 medical oversight\\n\\nMedical equipment and supplies\\n\\nPersonal care\\n\\nMedication management\\n\\nRehabilitation programs and therapies\\n\\nPalliative and hospice care\\n\\nNursing home costs vary based on location and level of care provided. However, the median monthly cost of nursing home care in the U.S. is about $7,908 for a semi-private room and $9,034 for a private room, according to Genworth’s 2021 Cost of Care Survey. A more recent survey has yet to be released by Genworth, but it’s likely that prices will continue to raise with increasing inflation and demand in the U.S.\\n\\nYou may wonder if veterans, veteran spouses, and surviving spouses get free nursing home care through the VA. Unfortunately, veterans benefits usually don’t provide free nursing home care. However, Community Living Centers and State Veterans Home can be affordable options for veterans and other eligible military-connected people.\\n\\nVeterans benefits for home care\\n\\nHome care provides nonmedical care for seniors who wish to age at home. In-home caregivers are trained in senior care and provide a wide range of services that cater to individual needs. Home care services may include personal care, companionship, cooking, light housekeeping, mobility assistance, and more. Senior veterans or dependents may be eligible for Aid and Attendance supplemental income, if they receive home care help with activities of daily living, such as bathing or dressing.\\n\\nThe cost of home care varies greatly, because it’s based on the type of care needed and how often it’s provided. However, in-home care is typically $30 per hour, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners.\\n\\nVeterans benefits for independent living\\n\\nIndependent living facilities are for older adults who are generally healthy, active, and able to live on their own. These communities offer a carefree lifestyle for older adults who want convenience and a social lifestyle, free of the responsibilities of home ownership. Independent living services often include prepared meals, housekeeping, complimentary transportation, and social activities.\\n\\nTypically, independent living facilities don’t provide assistance with activities of daily living, which is one of the requirements for Aid and Attendance eligibility. However, as seniors age, their health may decline and their care needs may change. Some independent living residents may eventually use home care services for help with personal care, and they may qualify for the Aid and Attendance at some point to help offset their monthly costs of living and care.\\n\\nLike with other senior care types, independent living costs vary based on location, amenities, and accommodations. The monthly median cost of rent at an independent living facility in the U.S. is $3,000, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data from its brand partners.\\n\\nVeterans benefits to pay family caregivers\\n\\nVeterans or dependents who qualify for Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits may be able to deduct the fees paid to a non-licensed in-home caregiver from their income. This means your loved one may deduct expenses related to paying a friend or family member other than their spouse to help with at least two activities of daily living.\\n\\nHowever, it isn’t possible to use Housebound or Aid and Attendance benefits to pay a spouse for care. This is because when an eligible veteran applies for veterans benefits, a spouse’s income is included in the household income, so care provided by a spouse isn’t considered a deductible expense.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nGather documentation to apply for VA benefits\\n\\nYou or your loved one may need to gather some information and documents, including:\\n\\nThe veteran’s Social Security number or VA file number\\n\\nMilitary history information\\n\\nFinancial information for the veteran, veteran dependents, or surviving family members\\n\\nBank account direct deposit information\\n\\nThe veteran’s original discharge papers (DD214)\\n\\nMarriage certificate, typically for surviving spouses only\\n\\nPeople under the age of 65 may also need:\\n\\nWork history information\\n\\nMedical information\\n\\nContact the VA to begin an application\\n\\nYour loved one may need to reach out to the VA directly if they wish to apply for VA benefits and programs. They can reach the VA through the following ways:\\n\\nCall 800-698-2411 (Anyone utilizing TTY can reach the VA at 711.)\\n\\nUse the Ask VA online tool\\n\\nSend questions to the VA chatbot, a virtual assistant agent\\n\\nVisit a local VA location\\n\\nContact support organizations for application assistance\\n\\nIf you want additional assistance applying for VA benefits outside of direct VA support, you may want to consider the following options for benefits counseling and advocacy:\\n\\nVeteran service organizations, or VSOs, offer free, basic guidance on the application process and can answer simple questions about available benefits and the application process. VSO volunteers often offer assistance across the country at American Legion halls and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) lodges.\\n\\nVeterans organizations, such as VFW, American Legion, and DAV, may also answer questions about benefits and help you prepare your application free of charge. Some organizations can even provide legal advocacy and help families appeal denied claims.\\n\\nAccredited VA consultants can also help families assess eligibility for VA long-term care benefits and help with financial planning as you prepare your loved one’s application. Accredited VA consultants offer paid assistance to families whose benefit application has been denied. Like other VA benefit counselors, these consultants can help determine why an application was denied and help make any changes to increase the chances of approval upon resubmission. It’s important to know that regulations prohibit consultants from charging families for help with an initial claim that hasn’t been denied.\\n\\nElder law attorneys can help families with financial planning and the VA benefits application process.

We clearly disclose financial relationships around featured products or services.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA application and approval process length\\n\\nThe application process for veterans benefits can be slow. You or your loved one will probably need to fill out several forms, and it may take some time to gather all the information and documents your loved one needs to complete their application.\\n\\nThe approval process for VA benefits may also take several months. Make sure to be thorough when completing your application so that it can be processed as quickly as possible. Eligible veterans and surviving spouses who are age 90 or older may request an expedited review in a cover letter with their application.\\n\\nRetroactive VA benefits\\n\\nWhile the application process may take several months, veterans benefits are paid retroactively once approved. This means the first benefit payment includes a lump sum to cover the months where the application was pending. Speak to a VA representative to learn how to establish a date for retroactive payments.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA long-term care benefits with Medicare\\n\\nIf your loved one qualifies for both Medicare and VA benefits, they may enroll in both programs. However, unlike veterans benefits for senior care, Medicare doesn’t cover the cost of home care or expenses related to care at senior living facilities. Medicare only pays for short-term care at approved nursing home facilities for individuals needing rehabilitation after an illness or injury that required hospitalization. In some cases, Medicare may also cover in-home rehabilitation services and therapies.\\n\\nShort-term care expenses covered by Original Medicare at a Medicare-contracted nursing facility include:\\n\\n100% of the first 20 days in a skilled nursing facility, after a three-night minimum inpatient hospitalization\\n\\nA portion of days 21-100 in a skilled nursing facility with a coinsurance of up to $200 per day\\n\\nShort-term rehabilitation care after a hospitalization\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA long-term care benefits with Medicaid may cover the cost of senior care\\n\\nBoth the VA and Medicaid offer long-term care benefits. The VA Aid and Attendance benefit may be used to help pay for home care, assisted living, or nursing home costs. Medicaid typically only covers the cost of long-term care at nursing homes. In some cases, Medicaid may cover home care costs or community-based services for eligible beneficiaries, if they’d require nursing home care without such services. Knowing the type of care your loved one needs, plus eligibility requirements for VA benefits and Medicaid, will help you determine whether to apply for financial assistance for senior care from one program over the other.\\n\\nIf your loved one is a veteran who is eligible for VA benefits for long-term care, they may also be eligible for Medicaid. For example, let’s say your family member qualifies for Aid and Attendance, but the amount their benefit pays isn’t enough to cover long-term care costs. In that case, Medicaid may cover the rest of the cost of nursing home care, if your family member qualifies financially.\\n\\nHowever, Medicaid programs vary from state to state. For this reason, it may be a good idea to seek advice from an elder law attorney if you’re planning to apply for both VA benefits and Medicaid.\\n\\nBack to top\\n\\nVA burial benefits: A final salute\\n\\nVeterans who receive an honorable or general discharge may be buried in a national cemetery or a state veterans cemetery where the veteran lived at the time of death, as long as a gravesite is available.\\n\\nThere’s no cost to the veteran’s family for the gravesite or a headstone or marker. Spouses and dependents of veterans may also be buried in a national cemetery with the veteran. The VA will pay to have the spouse’s or dependent’s name and date of birth inscribed on the veteran’s headstone.\\n\\nFor veterans buried in a private cemetery, the VA provides a government headstone or marker and a burial flag at no cost to the veteran’s family. However, costs related to the headstone placement are not paid by the VA.\\n\\nThe VA also provides financial assistance to reimburse families of veterans for funeral and burial services. To qualify for these benefits, the deceased veteran must meet certain requirements. The amount reimbursed depends on several factors, including whether the cause of death was service-related.\\n\\nService-related deaths. The VA will pay up to $2,000 for burial expenses. Some or all of the transportation costs to a VA national cemetery may also be reimbursed, if that’s where the veteran will be buried.\\n\\nNon-service-related deaths. The amounts paid vary based on date of death and whether the veteran dies at a VA hospital. However, burial and funeral expenses, as well as the cost of a burial plot, may be reimbursed.\\n\\nPeople who may be qualified for the VA burial benefit\\n\\nIf you’re a family member of a veteran who paid for funeral or burial costs, you may be reimbursed for these costs, as long as the veteran received an honorable or general discharge and at least one of these other requirements are met:\\n\\nThe veteran died because of a service-related disability.\\n\\nThe veteran was receiving VA pension or other compensation at the time of death, or had started the application process to receive these benefits and was found entitled to them.\\n\\nThe veteran died at a VA hospital or while receiving care at another hospital under VA contract.\\n\\nThe veteran died while traveling for care, treatment, or examination authorized and paid by the VA.\\n\\nThe veteran died at a VA-approved state nursing home on or after October 9, 1996.\\n\\nApply for VA burial benefits\\n\\nYou will need to gather a few documents to apply for VA burial and funeral allowance benefits, including:\\n\\nA death certificate\\n\\nThe veteran’s discharge documents\\n\\nReceipts for payments you’ve made related to the funeral or burial services and burial plot\\n\\nNext, you can submit your application for VA burial on the VA website. You can also mail your application to the Pension Management Center that serves your state, work with an accredited VA representative to start the application process, or go to a local regional benefit office to turn in your application form in person.\\n\\nBack to top', '# [Independent Living Facilities in Maryland](https://www.aplaceformom.com/independent-living/maryland)\\nThe state of Maryland falls in the middle of the country’s Northeast, Southern, and Midwestern regions, and its culture combines elements of them all. This is part of why Maryland earned the nickname “America in Miniature.” With the Appalachian Mountains passing through the far western part of the state, and the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic coastlines in the east, Maryland’s geographical features give residents plenty of opportunities for outdoor activities — even in a small state. Annapolis and Baltimore are also home to many historic Colonial sites, and Washington, D.C. sits on Maryland’s southern border. Maryland is a transition state in several ways, which helps make it an attractive retirement destination.\\n\\nCurrently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 100 independent living communities in Maryland.\\n\\nThe median monthly cost of independent living in Maryland is about $3,600.\\n\\nIndependent living communities in Maryland don’t have to be licensed and aren’t regulated by a state agency, but they must adhere to local housing laws. They are treated as regular rental properties, but have age restrictions in place and offer senior-focused amenities.\\n\\nIt’s not uncommon for independent living communities to share a campus with other senior living facilities, like assisted living or memory care, which provide higher levels of care. The state does license and regulate these communities, meaning they must follow Maryland assisted living regulations.\\n\\nStand-alone independent living communities must follow the same rules and standards as any other rental property in Maryland. A lease for a term of one year or less is valid whether it is written or oral. However, anything lasting longer must be in writing and signed by the lease’s creator to be valid. A landlord’s responsibilities to renters include:[01]\\n\\nProviding renters with a residence that complies with the state’s health and safety regulations\\n\\nProviding access to heat, light, electricity, hot/cold running water, and adequate sewage disposal\\n\\nRepairing the property within a “reasonable time,” which cannot exceed 30 days after receiving notice from a tenant\\n\\nComplying with laws governing security deposits and eviction procedures\\n\\nNotifying a tenant if they plan to raise rent and only raising rent upon lease renewal\\n\\nLikewise, tenants have responsibilities to uphold while renting a property. They must:\\n\\nPay rent on time\\n\\nReport damage or needed repairs\\n\\nReturn possession of the property to the owner at the agreed upon time\\n\\nReturn the property in the same condition as when they moved in, minus ordinary wear and tear\\n\\nBesides the above, certain towns, cities, or counties may have other tenant responsibilities. For example, Montgomery County requires tenants to have a landlord’s written approval before keeping a pet on the premises.\\n\\nProtections against discrimination\\n\\nCourts state that Maryland’s law is “substantially equivalent” to federal law preventing housing discrimination. Homeowners cannot discriminate due to race, color, religion, family status, national origin, disability, and source of income, as well as gender identification, marital status, and sexual orientation.\\n\\nFederal nondiscrimination laws like the Fair Housing Act, Section 504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also protect tenants from discrimination due to disability. These laws require landlords to provide reasonable accommodations and modifications to those with disabilities so they can enjoy and use a dwelling. Examples include exceptions to a “no pets” policy for service animals and a reserved parking place for someone with a mobility impairment.[02]\\n\\nHow to find independent living community inspection reports in Maryland\\n\\nThough stand-alone independent living communities don’t undergo inspection reports, some apartment-based reports and inspections may take place. Residential rental properties built before 1978 are required to register in the lead rental registry and renew it annually with the Maryland Department of the Environment. Residential rental properties built after 1977 and properties that have a passing Lead-Free inspection certificate are exempt. You can search the lead rental registry online to confirm a property’s compliance.\\n\\nAdditionally, certain cities and counties may have their own rental regulations. For instance, Baltimore city rental units must be registered, inspected, and licensed by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). The inspection requirements are publicly available to view, while those with inquiries can contact the DHCD by email at S8Landlord@habc.org or HCVInspections@habc.org.\\n\\nIndependent living options on a larger campus with other care options like assisted living or memory care may have other requirements. Generally, only the portions of a larger campus offering care must adhere to the relevant regulations.\\n\\nAssisted living facilities with 10 or more beds require their own regular reports and inspections. This includes an unannounced health and fire safety inspection every one to two years, as well as annually collecting mandatory influenza vaccination policies and vaccination rates of assisted living staff. These reports are available online through the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC).[03]\\n\\nMaryland Department of Health contact information\\n\\nMaryland Department of Health\\n\\n201 W.

Maine has over 17 million acres of forest and more than 3,470 miles of coastline on the mainland – 5,000 miles total if you include all of its islands. With more coastline than California, it’s no surprise that Maine is famous for seafood. Over 90% of the country’s lobster is harvested in Maine, and much of the state’s culture is influenced by the fishing industry. Locals love to celebrate Maine’s seafaring and fishing heritage, especially at events like the annual Maine Lobster Festival. Maine’s awe-inspiring natural beauty and the rustic charm of cities like Portland and Augusta make Maine an excellent retirement destination.\\n\\nCurrently, A Place for Mom partners with more than 15 retirement communities in Maine that offer independent living. The median monthly cost of independent living in Maine is about $2,900.\\n\\nMaine doesn’t have specific regulations or licensing requirements for independent living communities.

Instead, they are treated as standard rentals and must follow Massachusetts rental laws outlined by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities (EOHLC). These communities typically have a minimum age requirement, which is typically 62 years.\\n\\nRegulations for independent living on a senior care campus\\n\\nIn Massachusetts, if an independent living facility shares a campus with an assisted living or memory care facility, then those senior care units must be licensed. To learn more about the senior care licensing process and facility regulations, check out the Massachusetts assisted living regulations and memory care regulations.\\n\\nMassachusetts doesn’t offer inspection reports online, but you can request a copy of an assisted living or memory care facility by contacting the Executive Office of Elder Affairs at information.resources@mass.gov or fax them at 617-727-9368.\\n\\nStand-alone independent living facility requirements\\n\\nLike any Massachusetts rental, stand-alone independent living facilities must offer senior residents a safe and habitable living environment. Independent living rentals in Massachusetts must adhere to the following requirements:[01]\\n\\nProvide residents basic services — like maintenance, fully functioning utilities, and stable structural elements.\\n\\nMaintain a safe and healthy environment free of cockroaches and rodents.\\n\\nOffer equal housing opportunities, therefore they cannot refuse to rent to someone with a disability.\\n\\nTenant rights in Massachusetts\\n\\nIf an independent living landlord in Massachusetts fails to provide a safe and habitable environment, tenants have rights to remedies available to them. Some of the most important tenant rights to note include:[01]\\n\\nTenants can deduct up to four months of future rent to cover repair costs if a landlord fails to start or contract for repairs within five days of notice. And, if the landlord fails to complete repairs that impact a resident’s health or safety within two weeks.\\n\\nTenants may withhold a portion of rent if the landlord fails to provide habitable conditions.\\n\\nBefore withholding rent or proceeding with repairs, tenants should get legal advice because it could breach their lease agreement. The Mass.gov website offers several legal services to help tenants in such situations.\\n\\nIf you would like to report a complaint or need help resolving a housing dispute, you can contact the Attorney General’s Consumer Hotline at 617-727-8400.\\n\\nFair housing laws for seniors with disabilities\\n\\nFair housing laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities and require landlords to offer reasonable accommodations and modifications.[02] Therefore, an independent living facility in Massachusetts cannot refuse to rent due to a senior’s disability.\\n\\nA reasonable accommodation is a change to policy that will allow a person with a disability to use common areas. Some examples that could help an individual with a disability include:[02]\\n\\nAssigning a closer parking space\\n\\nAllowing a service animal regardless of pet policies\\n\\nRelocating the trash to be more accessible on a ground floor\\n\\nA reasonable modification is a structural change that is made to existing premises. Some modifications that could help a senior with a disability include:[02]\\n\\nInstalling a visual fire alarm for a deaf resident\\n\\nAdding a ramp to a building entrance\\n\\nInstalling grab bars in a resident’s bathroom\\n\\nIndependent living facility providers must cover the cost of accommodations or modifications as long as they don’t result in an undue financial and administrative burden, or a fundamental alteration.[02]\\n\\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health contact information', '# [Assisted Living In Pennsylvania](https://www.aplaceformom.com/assisted-living/pennsylvania)\\nThe private pay options available to your senior loved one will depend on their current situation.

These facilities provide room and board, assistance with daily activities, and limited nursing services. On average, the cost of assisted living in Washington is $5,500 per month, or $66,000 annually, according to A Place for Mom’s internal data. Assisted living is the second most affordable senior living option in Washington, right behind independent living.\\n\\nAssisted living costs greatly vary in Washington and often depend on factors like location, floor plan, care needs, and amenities. However, the approximate monthly cost of assisted living ranges from $3,500 to $7,800, according to A Place for Mom’s proprietary data.[01] This cost range is an estimate based on what referred families actually paid at our partnering assisted living facilities in Washington. Costs account for room and board, care, and access to on-site amenities.\\n\\nThe average cost of assisted living in Washington is close to the national average, but it’s slightly higher by a few hundred dollars. Some Washington assisted living communities have higher prices because they’re located in popular areas, offer more on-site health care services, and feature robust lifestyle programs. However, there are more affordable options in less popular areas that still offer a healthy balance of care services and amenities. Seniors and their families can also save on some care costs with programs like Medicaid or Medicare.\\n\\nSeniors and their families often pull together several income sources to cover assisted living costs in Washington. Families who start planning early tend to have the most options because it gives them more time to research the most suitable options.

Between that and his mourning, he hadn\\'t gotten to involved - yet. 8.Value for the money:Affordable for the variety of amenities and facility. *Still \"pricey in comparison to true independent living. ADDITIONAL COMMENT: (Their actual move in dates... Mom = end of May. Dad = first of June) Bonaventure and the team there were exactly what my father needed during this transition - especially with mom\\'s unexpected passing. The positive experience and support was invaluable... and still is. Dad said he\\'d \"stay the course\" even though the move was mostly for mom... He said he\\'d give it 6 months and then re-evaluate. Well... Recently, he told me that he didn\\'t need 6 months to decide. My paraphrase: \"This is starting to feel more like home and where he will remain, LORD willing, until He comes - or I go to be with Him.\"\\n\\nClean, Caring, Compassionate\\n\\nWe secured a beautiful one bedroom apartment in the memory wing at Bonaventure for my wife who suffered with dementia. Sadly, by the time we were able to move her into her room at Bonaventure, she entered hospice care and passed away a short time later. As hard as it was to go through, one ray of sunshine was our experience with Bonaventure. The staff were caring and friendly, the facility was clean and well decorated, her room was large and inviting, and most of all, the residents I got to know during our short time there were all happy and comfortable. The care giver to resident ratio was excellent at less than 1:10 whereas some other places we visited were 1:20 or higher. The rooms were also nicer. Ours was newly renovated and more like an apartment rather than just a room like the others. We had a large living room space with a separate bedroom and nice big bathroom. Pricing was also very competitive. Based on my brief experience, I highly recommend Bonaventure.\\n\\nBest choice hands down\\n\\nI gave the food less than perfect, but I think it actually is pretty dang good. They have trouble with enough serving staff. Also my parents don\\'t really take advantage of the salad bar and the soup but they love both. They get pretty darn good food but they do complain a little bit. I think they\\'ve handled outbreaks of Covid very well too. My parents are in the independent living, but they\\'ve provided assistance every single time they\\'ve ever been needed. I just am amazed. My mom is easy to live with, but my dad is extremely obnoxious in so many ways. They\\'ve handled it beautifully and haven\\'t kicked him out. He\\'s even more social in a positive way than I\\'ve ever seen him before in my life. I could go on and on\\n\\nA heavy weight off my heart\\n\\nI had to order hospice for my person. Staff made the transition bearable. They were phenomenal comfort to me and took great care to provide my person everything needed. He had a studio which had room for his bed, a dresser, and a recliner. It also had two very large closets. The bathroom was large. The room had a window to the secure court yard. The whole experience starting with A Place for Mom could not have been better. I was finally able to sleep at night knowing he was well cared for.\\n\\nBonaventure of Salmon Creek review\\n\\nStaff and most of the residents are very friendly. Meals are mostly very good but we can order alternatives if we want. Activities are good. I have been here 3 months. At first it was quite an adjustment but am really happy! I still have my car and still volunteer every week at a food pantry in Oregon. Still independent and hope to be for a long time! Am happy I chose this place and appreciate all of your help in getting me here', '# [Assisted Living In Nebraska](https://www.aplaceformom.com/assisted-living/nebraska)\\nIt’s common for people to begin by using private pay options to cover the costs of assisted living in Nebraska.\\n\\nSelling a house\\n\\nOne option to pay for assisted living in Nebraska is selling a home to access equity.\\n\\nReverse mortgage\\n\\nIf your loved one wants to keep their home, they may be able to access equity through a reverse mortgage to pay for assisted living in Nebraska.\\n\\nHealth savings accounts (HSAs)\\n\\nDoes your loved one have a health savings account (HSA)?

I immediately hung up realizing the tech guy had text me his direct phone number and they called me back 7-8 times within an hour. I finally answered and inquired on why they were so relentless and was told that they just want to\\nhelp people..  that is overkill and the relentless contact is ruining our reputation.. \\n\\nI worked in senior living prior to working for a place for mom and the experience in a community setting (skilled nursing and assisted living) makes me have a better understanding of the importance of having a good community that fits someone’s care needs but also their personality. Most of the families I work with do move into the communities I recommend because I put the work in to make sure I am sending them to places they can afford and I know are great places… HOWEVER, most advisors have no prior experience in senior living… most of the new people are sales backgrounds and while my job is technically sales, I don’t like looking at it that way. \\n\\nHow it works is APFM is paid a referral fee by our community partners. Those communities sign a contract with us and agree to pay a referral fee if a resident we refer moves in, usually the equivalent of one month’s rent. Also, this is how we are free to families. \\n\\nI’m sorry to hear of all of the negative experiences people have.

Some things I wish I knew about the AL/MC referral system. \\n\\n- The whole system revolves around referral fees (ie, A Place for Mom is free but they\\'re going to get the community fee you pay or a portion of rent). I talked to a lot of places out of our budget and many folks were like \"Okay. Can I connect you to someone who can help?\". \\n- The system so much runs this way that some places you can\\'t even get a hold of without a referral (basically the number listed online will get you no one but A Place for Mom can get you a tour)\\n- You loose negotiating power by using referral companies, like if you can connect with a memory care without them you may be able to have your community fee cut in half or even totally dropped. \\n- You\\'ll be more likely to get in touch with less corporate feeling, family run places. Some of those I called the number online and got someone pretty quickly.\\n- With all this, I\\'d recommend trying to call some places near you, or trying to drop by, if you can, before dealing with A Place for Mom. I also found a more regional guy who I definitely preferred dealing with to A Place for Mom. APFM know nothing about the places they\\'re recommending beyond cost, and typically know nothing about your area. They still email me to this day, and if my mom ever needs a place I will not be dealing with them again. \\n- I hate it so much.

I work for APFM and get community fees waived for my families all the time. I just want my families I work with to find the right fit.. at the end of the day I do have a quota to meet, but I find that I can manage to meet that quota by providing a useful service to the families I work with and help them find a place that fits them well-financially and personality wise.. I definitely hope APFM will take the feedback we get from families and make changes.. we just got a new CEO and she is actually a great person.

I\\'m not at all saying all the workers at APFM are bad people or even bad at their jobs. I don\\'t however recommend them as a company. I was surprised by how predatory I found the senior care referral industry entirely. First, they hardly saved me time. If it was actually possible to get in touch with communities reasonably easily I\\'d far prefer to contact them myself. APFM didn\\'t have answers to most of my questions about a place so once I was actually connected with someone I\\'d still have to have a long conversation asking a bunch of questions. I would lose bargaining power simply for referrers being able to easily reach someone while I as a consumer couldn\\'t. I even said something about trying to get in touch to a place to ask some questions and the woman I was talking to from APFM said \"[it was] because they give us the real numbers\". \\n\\nMore then one place said they could lower the community fee or not charge it but then saw we were referred for APFM and said they couldn\\'t because of APFM. If you work with APFM and somehow have relationships with the places you\\'re sending folks that\\'s great but I have a hard time believing you could have too close of one since you\\'re dealing with places all over the country. \\n\\nThe regional guy I worked with was more helpful for us. He had been to several of the places he recommended, he also understood exactly where my mother lives in relation to the places he was suggesting. I\\'d still recommend folks look on their own if in any position to before using someone.

Avoid \\'A Place for Mom\\' at All Costs!**\\n\\nI cannot stress enough how terrible my experience with \\'A Place for Mom\\' has been. Even after informing them that my mother passed away, they continue to harass me with calls, as do the dozens of facilities they irresponsibly shared my contact information with—information I never authorized them to distribute. This service is an absolute waste of money and time.\\n\\nTheir promises are nothing but empty words. They assured me they would find a placement under $3,200 per month or refund the intake fee. Not only did they fail to deliver, but the only placement they found would have discontinued my mother\\'s dialysis care within two weeks, effectively ending her life. When they couldn\\'t find anything suitable, they backtracked on their refund promise, claiming that a location two hours away somehow fulfilled their commitment—despite it being completely impractical for us.\\n\\n\\'A Place for Mom\\' does nothing more than provide outdated, generic email lists that you could find yourself through a basic internet search. They have ZERO personal knowledge of the facilities they recommend, and multiple communities told me they were worthless and wished more people knew. You end up doing all the work to vet these places yourself while they continuously bombard you with calls, texts, and emails to squeeze money out of your situation. I ultimately found a far better non-profit in Atlanta that genuinely helped me find the right fit for my mom.

Mom would have needed memory care if dad died, but with him as an anchor she did fine in the ALF.  However, with lingering problems from the broken hip and extremely poor compliance with rehab, I don\\'t see her ever getting back to the ALF, which has told me they \"generally won\\'t take anyone that isn\\'t at least 50% weight bearing.\"  I\\'m doubtful she will ever get back to that, and the ALF director (a very good guy) told me (with all kinds of caveats) that he is skeptical she will be able to come back.  The nursing home is using a slide board, which the ALF theoretically can use, but they seem reluctant to take someone back that may need that for a long time, or forever.  To make matters more complicated, dad categorically refuses to move out of the area, which is now prone to terrible traffic.  It often takes him 45 minutes to the nursing home mom is rehabbing in, so staying there long term is not a solution.  Its also not a great place, especially nights and weekends.  My dad would not meet the requirements to live in a nursing home without insurance fraud, and he\\'d probably go nuts with her in one of those tiny rooms.  At least in the ALF, he could get some space every now and then.  So the best situation would either be a facility with both a nursing home and an ALF, or two independent facilities very close together.  \\n\\n**The Need:**  Its sufficiently complicated and I\\'m sufficiently far away that I\\'m thinking if there is quality professional help out there, that would be great.  Anyone have positive or negative experiences with the various services?\\n\\n## Comment ID iuo4kdh with +12 score by [(SandhillCrane5, Reddit, 2022-11-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/yjbylo/thoughtsrecommendations_for_senior_placement/iuo4kdh/) (in reply to ID yjbylo):\\nYou\\'d be better off hiring a private Geriatric Care Manager to help you find an appropriate place rather than severely limiting your options to facilities that need to pay a service for referrals. The better facilities do not utilize A Place for Mom and similar services. A licensed and certified Geriatric Care Manager is highly qualified and experienced and since you are hiring and paying them, their only goal will be to recommend the best care possible within your guidelines.

PLEASE do not use them-they’re predatory, do not care about you or your loved one and will sell your loved ones information to every marketing firm they can think of. They only work with communities who pay for their referrals and, as others have said, high quality communities don’t have to pay for referrals. The “counselors” will send your loved ones information to every community they contract with in your general area, they do nothing to actually determine what is best for your loved one, they just want the money for the placement contract. If you are looking for care please check the Nursing Home Compare site on Medicare.gov or speak with the long term care ombudsman in your area. Google is also your friend, read reviews, take tours (most communities are happy to accommodate a virtual tour if needed), talk to others who have had to move their loved one into care, or look for local placement services (they’re smaller and tend to be actually client focused).

The service they provide is basically the same now as then....actually, it's less now.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment ID kbl6acs with +1 score by [(CJGmama, Reddit, 2023-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eldercare/comments/99xfpk/experience_with_a_place_for_mom/kbl6acs/) (in reply to ID 99xfpk):\\nWe recently were trying to fund a place for my MIL. The family mber who had been taking care of her died and she was in a less-than-preferable care facility 8 hours away.\\nA Place For Mom counselors were a lifeline, and incredibly patient. At my initial call, she gave me five options that we could tour. We found one we wanted, but couldn't move her until hubby and BIL were named conservators. It took ages and in that time she went downhill so we needed memory care.\\nAgain, A Place For Mom found us options. \\nThe legal system in WV takes its sweet time, and by the time she could finally be moved, she needed hospice care. \\nSadly, because the care home was not on top of things, she died before we could move her closer.

They’re a for profit referral service that does absolutely nothing themselves. And apparently they get paid per contact they make because this mother and son (their claim) wouldn’t stop calling me. Even after blocking their numbers they continued calling me on new numbers. And going by my caller ID, the same pair also work for Visiting Angels, Aging Care and a few other names that you’ll see pop up as sponsored sites when you google help for aging parents. I just want to warn as many people as I can about these scammers.\\xa0It’s been over a year since I first gave them my number and I cannot get rid of them. If you want to find out for yourself, try filling out their form without giving them a phone number, or only giving them a landline number. If you get a message that a cell phone number is required information or not optional - you can be sure someone is attempting to get your number for the purpose of giving it to salesmen. Or selling it to other sites.

It’s more reasonable than some others in the city because you could opt out of some meals (or all) if the tenant is able to cook for themselves.\\n\\nShe was at chartwell riverside until a couple years ago and it was as expensive but you had to take the meals, which were the primary complaint.  At the time she left they were literally serving rotten food in some dishes (brown slimy lettuce, mashed potatoes full of dark brown bits) and the portions kept shrinking.  \\n\\nMy grandma has also thought about trying to look at other options that may be more affordable, but there is a major downgrade in amenities and environment and staff care, and the lower price wasn’t really worth that much of a step down in our opinion.  \\n\\nShe likes living there on the whole, but price increase time is always a bad time for her too.\\n\\n## Comment ID lkp89n6 with +1 score by [(dot_jo65, Reddit, 2024-08-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/londonontario/comments/1f447ts/retirement_facilities_in_town_that_arent/lkp89n6/) (in reply to ID 1f447ts):\\nCheck out Grandwood Park on the edge of Old South on Grand Ave. There are small ‘suites’ (basically one room plus a bathroom) that went for approx 2900-3000/month last year-so potentially more a year later. There are also 1 bedroom/living area/bathroom as well. The monthly fee Included all meals, snack areas, weekly housekeeping. There are staff on site 24 hrs and if additional services required, then additional fees of course as that unfortunately is the retirement home model. It is an older building, used to be the original Parkwood Hospital. Had a positive vibe when touring facilities for an older friend last year.

Their quotas are extremely high and unattainable, their staff turnover rates are incredibly high too. Lead quality is terrible, most people who are calling in are Medicaid leads and APFM does not support people who are not private pay. \\n\\nAPFM preys upon vulnerable elderly people. I felt very morally conflicted here and the leaders at this company simply don’t have a conscience. They want you to use hard sales tactics on these families and senior citizens and harass them frequently. The standard of living in most of these communities that APFM is partnered with is very very poor. \\n\\nThere are metrics for your every move in the role, be prepared to be micromanaged every step of the way. 50 dial minimum per day, referral rates are tracked, you must book a tour on every call, those numbers are tracked. \\n\\nYou can make good money with your commission if you’re able to get to quota. The thing is, is that they intentionally make it impossible to get to goal, so you’re never able to make that extra money. You don’t get paid any commission until you’re over 50% to your quota, so be prepared to only be paid your base pay. \\n\\nI went into the role very optimistic and have given it my all.

Despite the founders\\' efforts to instill a positive culture, it\\'s evident that employees are viewed as expendable assets rather than valued contributors.Human Resources fails miserably in its role as a safeguard against mistreatment, rendering it ineffective for protecting employees from verbal abuse and poor treatment.

The President\\'s incompetence, demonstrated by an inability to operate basic tools like PowerPoint, further undermines confidence in leadership during town hall meetings.Lamentably, A Place for Mom lacks coherent direction and fails to execute effectively. Micromanagement tactics are wielded as instruments of intimidation, with every call monitored and management fostering a culture of fear rather than motivation. The abundance of purportedly \"5-star\" reviews reeks of manipulation by upper management to maintain inflated ratings.Despite lip service paid to teamwork and collaboration, the reality is starkly different.

But seniors and their families might not realize that’s less than half of the facilities on the market, the letter states.\\n\\nCasey’s letter also criticizes A Place for Mom for encouraging families to spend more than they can afford. It cites a frequently asked questions section of the company’s website that encourages facilities not to worry if they charge more than a family’s stated upper limit. According to the FAQ, nearly 40% of families who moved to senior living paid roughly $1,000 more per month than they had budgeted.\\n\\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\\n\\nThe FAQ also says its advisers do their best “to ensure that no federally funded family is referred” to the communities, effectively barring families who want to use Medicaid funding to cover assisted living costs.A Place for Mom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nAssisted living and elder care are part of a booming industry that’s expected to continue expanding in the next two decades. The average monthly cost of assisted living is around $4,500 to $5,300, but it varies depending on location and the level of care required. A majority of the facilities are affiliated with chains or large corporations, and the quality of care has increasingly been called into question as private equity firms have taken greater ownership of the industry.\\n\\nIn 2010, The Seattle Times reported that A Place for Mom referred people to senior living homes without inspecting them for quality or safety, directing families toward facilities with documented abuse and neglect violations. The company said at the time that its advisers sometimes fall behind on visiting facilities in person but that many families were satisfied with its services.\\n\\nThis year, a Washington Post analysis found that more than a third of the facilities the website recommended as “Best of Senior Living” across 28 states had been “cited for neglect or substandard care in the past two years.” State oversight records reviewed by the Post alleged the facilities failed to properly tend to injuries, mismanaged medication and did not adequately monitor patients who later died. The company told the Post it encourages families to do their own research to make “an informed decision.”\\n\\nWhile A Place for Mom is the biggest senior living referral service, it is not the only website that receives commissions from facilities for finding them residents.\\n\\nKate Granigan, board president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit group that advocates for ethical standards in elder care, said that as long as the facilities foot the bill for referrals — rather than the consumers’ paying advisers for recommendations — the model is “ripe for conflict.” She said she would support legislation to require minimum transparency standards for referral services.\\n\\n“Transparency about how they get paid is important to the consumer. “As is the fact that they don’t represent everything that’s out there — they represent who pays them. I also think there should be transparency about their expertise,” Granigan said, noting that consumers may not understand that not all of the advisers who help them have medical backgrounds.\\n\\nA Place for Mom was previously owned by a private equity firm that simultaneously had invested in assisted living facilities, before the website was sold to the two other private equity firms that currently hold it, according to Casey’s letter.\\n\\nCasey’s letter asked A Place for Mom for its total revenue for each of the last three years and for the 100 facilities it received the most money from and referred the most people to over the same period. The letter also requested details on A Place for Mom's process for vetting facilities and the total number of move-in fees it received last year, along with copies of sample contracts. The company has until July 15 to provide the requested information.\", '# [Casey Demands Major Assisted Living Facility Referral Service ‘A Place for Mom’ Address Concerns About Deceptive Marketing Practices on 2024-06-18](https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-demands-major-assisted-living-facility-referral-service-a-place-for-mom-address-concerns-about-deceptive-marketing-practices)\\nIn letter, Casey raises concerns that A Place for Mom, which markets itself as an unbiased and no-cost referral service for assisted living facilities, is misleading older adults and their families\\n\\nCasey points to evidence that company’s recommendations are not objective, not safe, and not truly free\\n\\nCasey pushes company for more information so families can better understand what A Place for Mom’s recommendations mean\\n\\nWashington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, sent a letter pushing one of the Nation’s largest assisted living referral services to disclose more information about its potentially deceptive business practices that are putting older adults and their families at risk. Casey sent the letter to A Place for Mom, which is misleading older adults and their families by claiming that it is an unbiased and no-cost recommendation and referral service for people in search of assisted living facilities. In the letter, Casey references company materials and recent reporting showing that the company’s recommendations are not objective, not safe, and not truly free.\\n\\n“Rather than offering an unbiased assessment of the best options out of the full set of facilities older adults and their families are choosing from, A Place for Mom only refers to facilities that pay the company a commission. Additionally, recent reporting suggests that some of A Place for Mom’s top-rated facilities actually have records of substandard or dangerous care and that the company may overstate the degree to which its services save families money,” wrote Chairman Casey (D-PA). “I therefore ask A Place for Mom to provide documents and responses regarding the company’s advertising and business practices, so families can have a better understanding of what the company’s recommendations mean while trying to make decisions about assisted living for themselves and their loved ones.”\\n\\nWhile A Place for Mom markets itself as unbiased and free referral service for anyone exploring assisted living options, these claims are undermined by the company’s own materials, as well as advice from former company employees and recent reporting. The company’s own materials show that the listings families are shown are limited to facilities from which it receives a commission, leaving out more than half of available assisted living options Nationwide. Recent reporting also shows that facilities that were top rated by the company have been cited for neglect or substandard care in the last two years.\\n\\nThe letter to A Place for Mom is just the latest step Chairman Casey has taken to expose the troubling conditions across the American assisted living landscape. In January, Casey sent letters to the three largest corporate owners of assisted living facilities, demanding the companies address significant concerns about workforce shortages and expensive and inadequate care in their facilities. He also held an Aging Committee hearing entitled “Assisted Living Facilities: Understanding Long-Term Care Options for Older Adults,” where he heard from patient advocates and experts about the conditions in American assisted living facilities, and issued a public call for families to share their experiences navigating the assisted living landscape with the Aging Committee.\\n\\nRead the full letter HERE or below:\\n\\nJune 17, 2024\\n\\nMs. Tatyana Zlotsky\\n\\nChief Executive Officer\\n\\nA Place for Mom\\n\\n530 Fifth Avenue\\n\\nNew York, NY 10036\\n\\nDear Ms. Zlotsky:\\n\\nI write to better understand A Place for Mom’s services and its role in advising older adults and their families around placement in assisted living facilities. A Place for Mom markets itself as an unbiased and no cost referral service for families in search of assisted living facilities, claiming its “interests are aligned to provide the best outcome for your family.” In reality, A Place for Mom’s own marketing and materials, as well as recent reporting, contradict the company’s claims. Rather than offering an unbiased assessment of the best options out of the full set of facilities older adults and their families are choosing from, A Place for Mom only refers to facilities that pay the company a commission. Additionally, recent reporting suggests that some of A Place for Mom’s top-rated facilities actually have records of substandard or dangerous care and that the company may overstate the degree to which its services save families money. I therefore ask A Place for Mom to provide documents and responses regarding the company’s advertising and business practices, so families can have a better understanding of what the company’s recommendations mean while trying to make decisions about assisted living for themselves and their loved ones.\\n\\nA Place for Mom’s claims that it is unbiased are undermined by its own materials, as well as expert advice from former company employees, given that the listings families are shown by A Place for Mom are limited to facilities from which it receives a commission. Families seeking information from A Place for Mom see offerings from less than half of available options nationwide. According to its homepage, A Place for Mom’s network includes approximately 14,000 facilities; there are approximately 30,600 total facilities in the country. Additionally, the company’s Terms of Use further notes that it maintains relationships with “contracted communities,” also dubbed “Participating Communities,” and shares information with interested families only about those facilities. As the former Chief Marketing Officer for A Place for Mom recently cautioned, “Many advisors online and in your local community are very knowledgeable about provider options—but only those they contract with. As a business, they naturally only present or recommend senior living communities that agree to pay them a commission.” He further added that referral services, like A Place for Mom, may refer to facilities that confer the greater financial benefit to A Place for Mom.\\n\\nFamilies searching for facilities on A Place for Mom do not see information about the financial relationship between A Place for Mom and a facility, including how much an individual facility has paid A Place for Mom. As such, families may not understand the extent to which a Place for Mom’s referrals are potentially influenced by the amount paid by a facility. It is therefore false and misleading for A Place for Mom to suggest a lack of bias among the options listed on its website.\\n\\nA Place for Mom’s claims to be a free service for families similarly ignores a central component of the company’s business model. According to A Place for Mom’s website, upon move-in to a facility, “the community only pays for first month’s rent and care” to A Place for Mom. In reality, facilities pass those costs along to residents and their families who pay significant fees for assisted living. Nationwide data showed the median single month’s rent in an assisted living facility is $5,350, but costs can be much higher. Brookdale, the largest assisted living facility operator, operates facilities with monthly fees over $16,000 per month. And assisted living costs have increased nearly 20 percent. The former A Place for Mom Chief Marketing Officer noted:\\n\\nMany senior referral agencies are well-funded, privately held organizations. As these for-profit services gain greater market share and pricing power – often through aggressive online marketing practices – they raise commission costs. Those higher costs are ultimately passed on to consumers down the line as [monthly rent and care] costs continually increase.\\n\\nFurther, A Place for Mom encourages families to spend above their initial budgets. In a blog post, an A Place for Mom employee wrote, “We have found that a senior’s initial budget does not always disclose the full amount that the family is willing and able to pay to move their loved one into their new home.” According to A Place for Mom data, nearly 40 percent of assisted living referrals paid above the upper limit of the budget range of families, with that figure rising to 55 percent for memory care referrals. A Place for Mom touted these data in a FAQ for facilities questioning why A Place for Mom referred families with budgets lower than individual facility’s rent, responding that “38% of the time families who moved to assisted living paid on average $987/month over the upper limit of their budget range.” It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means.\\n\\nBy their own admission, A Place for Mom endeavors to avoid referring any families seeking Medicaid coverage for assisted living costs. In response to a FAQ about placement of Medicaid recipients, A Place for Mom writes, “[Senior Living Advisors] do their best to ensure that no federally funded family is referred to your community.” Almost 20 percent of assist living residents across 46 states receive Medicaid assistance for some daily services. In declining to serve this population, A Place for Mom is again contradicting its own promises.\\n\\nA Place for Mom’s ownership by some of the largest private equity firms underscores its own profit seeking motives. Over the last several decades, private equity has increasingly invested in the broader senior living landscape, with a focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term support for older adults and workers. From 2010 to 2017, A Place for Mom was owned by Warburg Pincus, recently ranked the tenth largest private equity firm in the world. At the time, Warburg Pincus was also invested in assisted living facilities that it ultimately sold for a $450 million profit. In 2017, Warburg Pincus sold A Place for Mom to Silver Lake and General Atlantic, both among the largest global private equity firms. Starting in 2019, A Place for Mom undertook a two year “reinvention”, with plans to secure substantial new investments; the company raised $175 million by 2022.\\n\\nFinally, A Place for Mom also has a record of placing referred residents in jeopardy. A recent investigation revealed that facilities that received A Place for Mom’s “Best of Senior Living” awards had been cited for neglect or substandard care in the last two years. Reports dating to 2010 also raised concerns about the danger of referral services, including A Place for Mom, recommending substandard facilities. A Place for Mom attempts to avoid responsibility, noting in its Terms of Use that it does “not vouch for the accuracy or completeness of any of the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites, and do not take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of reading the information posted by and/or for the Participating Community on the Sites.”\\n\\nMy purpose for this letter is to clarify how A Place for Mom operates and the accuracy of the information and marketing it shares with families that are looking for support during times of great stress. I therefore ask that A Place for Mom provide the following information and documents no later than July 11, 2024:\\n\\nPlease provide the following information regarding A Place for Mom’s revenue and referrals:\\n\\nA Place for Mom’s total revenue for each of the last three years;\\n\\nThe 100 facilities from which A Place for Mom received the highest revenue across the last three years; and\\n\\nThe 100 facilities to which A Place for Mom referred the most potential residents across the last three years.\\n\\nPlease provide a sample contract and/or partnership agreement between A Place for Mom and a potential participating community. Please ensure the sample document details fee structures, terms of the agreement, and mechanism to terminate the agreement.\\n\\nPlease provide the following information regarding A Place for Mom’s referrals and fees:\\n\\nThe minimum and maximum first month fees received from facilities by A Place for Mom during 2023 by state;\\n\\nThe mean first month fee received from facilities by A Place for Mom during 2023 by state;\\n\\nThe total number of move-in fees paid to A Place for Mom in 2023.\\n\\nPlease provide information on the training required of A Place for Mom’s Senior Living Advisors regarding decision-making around long-term care, financial education, and familiarity with regional assisted living facilities (including conducting their own facility tours).\\n\\nPlease provide information on the process by which A Place for Mom reviews licensing, inspection, audit, complaint, and other safety and regulatory data of facilities prior to listing a facility on its website, as well as the frequency with which A Place for Mom reviews such data for listed offerings. If A Place for Mom identifies significant safety violations for a listed facility to which it has referred families, does A Place for Mom notify those families?\\n\\nThank you for your attention to this inquiry. If you or your staff has questions, please contact the Aging Committee Majority Staff at 202-224-5364.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBob Casey\\n\\nChairman\\n\\nSenate Special Committee on Aging\\n\\n###', '# [Washington Post Analysis Links A Place for Mom Reviews, Awards with Care Citations by Austin Montgomery, www.facebook.com, ausitn.montgomery on 2024-05-16](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/05/16/washington-post-analysis-links-a-place-for-mom-reviews-awards-with-care-citations/)\\nAn analysis by the Washington Post has found that roughly 37% of senior living properties recognized by the A Place for Mom referral service in 2023 and this year as award-winning communities were cited for “serious violations affecting resident care.”\\n\\nA Place for Mom had awarded the communities as “Best of Senior Living” properties on its referral lists in the past to years despite “many citations from state inspectors,” the Washington Post article states.\\n\\nThe Post cataloged APFM’s “best of” award in 2023 and 2024, looking up inspection and violation reports for 863 senior living communities in 28 states, of which 37.5% of the “Best of Senior Living” communities were found to have had state-level violations that impacted resident care.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThose violations spanned falls, bed sores, medication errors, call response issues, failure to bathe or groom residents, understaffing, sub-standard training, along with violence and sexual abuse, the Post article notes.\\n\\nThe recent Post analysis comes as more families and prospective residents search online to get information regarding local senior living options near them, and shape their decisions going forward.\\n\\n“A Place for Mom is proud to serve as an important resource to family caregivers,” the company said in an emailed statement to SHN. “Our national team of senior living advisors help to simplify a complex process, speaking with over 700K families every year. We are dedicated to our mission, providing access to transparent information, tools, and resources to help families make informed and confident senior care decisions.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo reach APFM’s “best of” list, senior living providers need recent reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, according to the APFM website.\\n\\nIn explaining how APFM interfaces with operators citing bankruptcy court documents, the Post notes that senior living providers pay APFM “a fee equal to about a month’s fees for a successful placement” of a new senior living resident.\\n\\nFounded in 2000, APFM is now owned by Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic, two private equity companies, and is the largest referral service in the industry.\\n\\nBut, the Post found, the APFM model creates incentives for senior living providers to influence or even “manipulate” their online reviews; the newspaper spoke with some former senior living professionals who described practices such as soliciting reviews selectively only from people having positive experiences, and staff being expected to meet review “quotas” so that positive reviews would outweigh negative ones.\\n\\n“Those reviews do not come by in a way that really give an accurate understanding of the culture of the community,” one former executive director told the Post.\\n\\nIn March, APFM cut its customer success team in favor of a new way of directly working with operators, as previously reported by SHN.

Bob Casey, chairman of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging, who penned a letter that alleges “deceptive business practices.”\\n\\nThe letter states the referral service’s marketing materials and recent reporting “contradict the company’s claims” of being “an unbiased and no cost referral service for families.”\\n\\nA Place for Mom had not responded to Senior Housing News as of press time.\\n\\nCasey’s letter asks the company to provide documents and responses regarding its practices “\\u200b\\u200bso families can have a better understanding of what A Place for Mom’s recommendations mean.”\\n\\nAmong the primary issues highlighted in the letter is how referrals work at the company, and how the referrals relate to payments that the company receives from senior living providers. Information from Casey states A Place for Mom’s network includes 14,000 communities and facilities out of the 30,600 in the country.\\n\\n“As the former Chief Marketing Officer for A Place for Mom recently cautioned, ‘Many advisors online and in your local community are very knowledgeable about provider options—but only those they contract with.

Casey also claims that “upselling” is occurring, with nearly 40% of families referred to communities paying above the upper limit of their budget for assisted living communities. That number reaches 55% for memory care referrals.\\n\\n“According to A Place for Mom’s website, upon move-in to a facility, ‘the community only pays for first month’s rent and care’ to A Place for Mom,” the letter states. “In reality, facilities pass those costs along to residents and their families who pay significant fees for assisted living.”\\n\\nAlongside these issues, the letter cites the Washington Post’s reporting about the company putting residents at risk, with some of their award-winning communities being cited for “serious violations affecting resident care.”\\n\\nA response to the letter is expected by July 15.', '# [Senior living referral site accused of using manipulated reviews, listing communities providing substandard care by Kimberly Bonvissuto on 2024-05-17](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/senior-living-referral-site-accused-of-using-manipulated-reviews-listing-communities-providing-substandard-care/)\\nAn analysis published by the Washington Post on Tuesday calls into question A Place for Mom’s description of itself as a “trusted advisory service,” accusing the senior living referral site of recommending communities that have been cited for neglect or providing substandard care and of using reviews that have been manipulated by providers.\\n\\nThe Post reviewed inspection reports for communities on A Place for Mom’s “Best of Senior Living” lists and said that a large number of those communities had been cited for violations, including medication errors, bedsores, falls, staff misconduct and exposure to hazards. The Post compared 863 of the company’s “Best of Senior Living” award recipients in 2023 and 2024 to state inspection reports, saying that 324 (37.5%) were cited for serious violations affecting resident care.\\n\\nThe media outlet noted that information is excluded from the referral sites’ list recommendations for assisted living communities, although it noted that the website included a link to a guide on how consumers can investigate potential issues at communities.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for A Place for Mom told McKnight’s Senior Living that it is continually improving its processes based on feedback from residents and their families.\\n\\n“A Place for Mom is proud to serve as an important resource to family caregivers,” the company said in a statement. “Our national team of senior living advisors help to simplify a complex process, speaking with over 700,000 families every year. We are dedicated to our mission, providing access to transparent information, tools and resources to help families make informed and confident senior care decisions.”\\n\\nReviews questioned\\n\\nThe Post story also questioned the validity of the consumer reviews on A Place for Mom’s site.\\n\\nCurrent and former sales managers at Pacifica Senior Living, StoryPoint Group, Brookdale Senior Living and Cogir Senior Living told The Post in interviews that “facilities throughout the industry routinely manipulate the reviews by asking residents and families with only positive experiences to write them and sometimes by soliciting fake ones.” Those employees also said that the senior living providers also aggressively seek positive reviews on other online referral sites.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for StoryPoint Group told McKnight’s Senior Living that it encourages all reviews and follows up with residents, families and staff members whether the feedback is good or bad.\\n\\n“We consistently provide a range of opportunities for our residents and their families to give feedback in a manner that is most comfortable to them, whether that’s through in-person conversations, over the phone, letters and/or reviews,” StoryPoint said. “And most importantly, caring for our residents is our focus and priority, as it has been for nearly 40 years. We strive to make our communities the best that they can be through the continuous feedback we receive and openness with those we serve.”\\n\\nA spokesman for Argentum told McKnight’s Senior Living that consumer choice is a core pillar of assisted living and what sets it apart from other long-term care settings.\\n\\n“Residents and families are encouraged to make a comprehensive assessment of their individual needs when choosing a community, including reviewing the types of care and supportive services that are available; meeting with caregivers and other staff, residents and their families; and reviewing disclosures and state inspection reports,” Argentum said.\\n\\nUltimately, the Argentum spokesman said, word-of-mouth referrals often can be a deciding factor in selecting a community.\\n\\n“This serves as a key part of why residents and families routinely give assisted living high satisfaction scores, including 90% reporting high satisfaction, 85% reporting high value, and nearly three in four reporting improved quality of life,” Argentum stated.\\n\\nFounded in 2000, A Place for Mom was sold in 2017 to technology investment firm Silver Lake and global growth equity firm General Atlantic. Two years later, the company made news when it agreed to settle for $6 million a putative class action lawsuit that claims the company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The company at the time said it did not agree with the allegations.\\n\\nThe Post story is the latest in the media outlet’s “Memory Inc.” series, which began in December with a package on elopements in assisted living and memory care communities. A subsequent article focused on Brookdale Senior Living’s staffing algorithm. Assisted living providers also have come under scrutiny by other media outlets, including The New York Times and KFF Health News, which in November focused on the industry’s pricing structure, rate increases and the for-profit status of providers.\\n\\nThose stories prompted the US Senate Special Committee on Aging to hold a hearing in January and request that Brookdale, Atria Senior Living and Sunrise Senior Living answer questions about costs, staffing levels and resident safety in their assisted living communities.\\n\\nSome senators pondered increased federal involvement in the industry and called for the Government Accountability Office to study how much federal money is spent on assisted living communities, the cost of assisted living services, and the transparency and availability of that information to consumers.

In an effort to draw attention to the challenges faced by the 41 million family caregivers in the country, the survey results reveal new and important information about the increasing obstacles caregivers are overcoming, highlighting the pressing need for more support and resources.\\n\\nAccording to the 2023 State of Caregiving Survey from A Place for Mom, 82% of caregivers reported their physical, mental, and financial well-being is at risk, with a large majority putting their parents’ needs above their own. The finding points to an acute caregiving crisis for families caring for aging parents across the country. A staggering 96% of family caregivers feel emotionally drained from the day-to-day challenges of caregiving. And 75% who were employed prior to assuming the caregiver role said they have less time to focus on work or have had to quit their jobs altogether to provide care.\\n\\n“The 2023 State of Caregiving Survey results point to the hard truths that many caregivers face while caring for their aging parents,” said Tatyana Zlotsky, President at A Place for Mom. “Caregivers don’t need to suffer in silence and there are many options that can help them navigate the process.

Casey calls out A Place for Mom over ‘potentially deceptive business practices’ by Kimberly Bonvissuto on 2024-06-20](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/sen-casey-calls-out-a-place-for-mom-over-potentially-deceptive-business-practices/)\\nAfter having its “trusted advisory service” tagline called into question last month by the Washington Post, senior living referral service A Place for Mom now is the target of US Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who is questioning the company’s “potentially deceptive business practices.”\\n\\nCasey, chairman of the US Senate Special Committee on Aging, in a letter dated Monday and shared Tuesday, asked the referral site to disclose more information about its business efforts, including its advertising practices. Stating that he is seeking clarity on how the company operates, Casey accused the company of “misleading older adults and their families by claiming that it is an unbiased and no-cost recommendation and referral service for people in search of assisted living facilities.”\\n\\nReferencing company marketing materials and information used in The Washington Post analysis, Casey said that the company’s recommendations are “not objective, not safe and not truly free.”\\n\\nHe suggested that the company only refers people to senior living communities that pay a commission, pointing to some A Place for Mom top-rated communities that “actually have records of substandard or dangerous care.” The senator wrote that A Place for Mom has a “record of placing referred residents in jeopardy” and “attempts to avoid responsibility” and liability by not vouching for the accuracy or completeness of information on communities listed on its site. By not disclosing the financial relationship the company has with companies listed on its site, Casey said, the company’s advertising is biased, false and misleading.\\n\\nHe also accused the company of encouraging families to “spend above their initial budgets,” pointing to its own data showing that 38% of families whose use of the service resulted in a move to assisted living paid monthly rent that was higher than the upper limit of their budget range, a figure that increased to 55% for memory care referrals.\\n\\n“It is clear A Place for Mom is upselling families, and the company ultimately benefits from families spending beyond their means,” Casey wrote.\\n\\nA Place for Mom previously told McKnight’s Senior Living that it is continually improving its processes based on feedback from residents and families, and that it is dedicated to “providing access to transparent information, tools and resources” to help families make informed decisions.\\n\\nCasey asked the company to provide information and documents by July 15 on three years of revenue, contract and partnership sample agreements with participating operators, fee data, training data for the company’s senior living advisers, and the company’s process for reviewing licensing, inspection, audit, complaint and other safety data on communities before they are listed on the website.\\n\\nHe further questioned the company’s ownership by private equity firms, an arrangement that Casey said “underscores its own profit seeking motives.”\\n\\nFounded in 2000, A Place for Mom was owned by Warburg Pincus from 2010 to 2017. The company was sold in 2017 to technology investment firm Silver Lake and global growth equity firm General Atlantic. Two years later, the company made news when it agreed to a $6 million settlement in a class action lawsuit claiming the company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. At the time, the company said it did not agree with the allegations.\\n\\nThe question about private equity comes after two of Casey’s colleagues in the Senate, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both of Massachusetts, recently introduced a bill they say is meant to “root out corporate greed and private equity abuse” in assisted living communities, nursing homes, home health agencies, hospices and other “healthcare entities.” Warren also sits on the Senate Aging Committee.\\n\\nIncreased scrutiny\\n\\nCasey’s letter to A Place for Mom follows letters he sent to senior living companies Brookdale Senior Living, Atria Senior Living and Sunrise Senior Living in January asking them to address “significant concerns” about costs, staffing levels and resident safety.\\n\\nAssisted living providers also came under scrutiny in November coverage by the New York Times and KFF Health News and in articles by the Washington Post in December and afterward. The lay media outlets reported on the deaths of residents with dementia who eloped from communities, the industry pricing structure, rate increases and the for-profit status of most providers. In a separate article in May, the Post published an analysis calling into question A Place for Mom’s description of itself as a “trusted advisory service,” accusing the senior living referral site of recommending communities that have been cited for neglect or providing substandard care and of using reviews that have been manipulated by providers.', '# [Washington Post Calls Out A Place for Mom for Conflict of Interest by Industry News on 2024-05-20](https://www.seniortrade.com/post/washington-post-calls-out-a-place-for-mom-for-significant-violations-related-to-resident-care)\\nMore than a third of “Best of Senior Living” properties were cited by state inspectors for significant violations related to resident care, including falls, bed sores, medication errors, insufficient staffing, violence and sexual abuse.\\n\\nAccording to a May 2024 Washington Post article,A Place for Mom, a senior-care referral site, has been recommending senior living communities that have been cited for state-level violations that impacted resident care. The investigation revealed that 37% of the communities awarded \"Best of Senior Living\" by A Place for Mom in 2023 and 2024 had significant violations related to resident care. These issues included falls, bed sores, medication errors, insufficient staffing, and incidents of violence and sexual abuse\\u200b.\\n\\nMoreover, the article highlighted concerns about the manipulation of online reviews. Former employees and senior living professionals indicated that there were practices in place to solicit positive reviews selectively and meet review quotas, which skewed the overall ratings of the facilities\\u200b. This manipulation potentially misleads families seeking reliable information about senior care options.\\n\\nA Place for Mom is a private company that receives large fees from assisted-living facilities and does not independently assess their records. They are the largest referral service senior living placement services, owned by private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic. The company\\'s personalized guidance is free for families, revenues come from supply side when a family member moves into a senior living community or signs up with a home care provider.\\n\\nThe article raises serious concerns about the integrity of A Place for Mom, casting a spotlight on an industry reliant on placement fees for senior living communities. The report underscores the need for families to have access to unbiased, conflict-free information when making decisions during this vulnerable period.', '# [‘Free’ For-Profit Senior Services Referrals: Buyer Beware by Howard Gleckman on 2024-07-03](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/07/03/free-for-profit-senior-services-referrals-buyer-beware/)\\nThose online senior living referral services are getting a lot of attention these days. And not in a good way. The chair of the U.S. Senate Aging Committee has begun an investigation into assisted living referrals by A Place for Mom, one of the biggest commercial advice outfits. At the same time, more states are requiring firms to publicly disclose their financial arrangements with the facilities they recommend.\\n\\nThe business model for most of these companies is simple: They steer users to senior living or other service providers that pay them, generally without regard to quality. In some cases, they refer most often to those facilities that pay the most, either through a fee or commission, or by purchasing advertising.\\n\\nPay To Play\\n\\nMost pay-to-play sites rarely bother to independently determine the quality of the facilities they endorse. A recent Washington Post investigation (paywall) found that more than a third of the facilities in 28 states that A Place for Mom highly recommended were cited by regulators for poor care.\\n\\nSome referral sites include consumer ratings, but The Post reported many are fake.\\n\\nThe potential conflicts of interest got the attention of Senate Aging Committee Chair Bob Casey (D-Pa.). In a letter to A Place for Mom, perhaps the largest of many for-profit referral businesses, Casey wrote:\\n\\n\"A Place for Mom’s claims that it is unbiased are undermined by its own materials, as well as expert advice from former company employees, given that the listings families are shown by A Place for Mom are limited to facilities from which it receives a commission.\"\\n\\nI reached out to A Place for Mom with a request for comment on the allegations and will update this post if I hear back.\\n\\nState Crackdowns\\n\\nAt the same time, states are moving to regulate these placement agencies.\\n\\nCalifornia requires them to be licensed. Several states are making referral firms disclose their financial relationships with the providers to which they steer consumers. States such as Arizona, Colorado, and Washington, and most recently Maryland have required the firms to tell consumers how they are compensated. A similar bill is pending the California legislature.\\n\\nThe Maryland law, which takes effect in October, is limited to only assisted living referrals. It requires referring sites to provide clients with information about their financial relationships with providers. It also limits the sites from sharing or selling personal medical information and requires referring firms to carry insurance.\\n\\nLimiting the regulations to assisted living referrals seems like a curious choice, since many firms use a similar business model with nursing homes, home care agencies, and other providers. But it is a start.\\n\\nIf for-profit referral firms prioritize the interests of providers over consumers, what are alternatives for families desperate to find quality care for their loved ones? Here are a few options:\\n\\nArea Agencies on Aging (AAAs). They are part of a network of local information and referral services, usually affiliated with or funded by government. These networks often include Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) and usually can be found through your local 2-1-1 call service or by calling the national Eldercare Locator at 800-677-1116.\\n\\nThe quality of AAAs is highly variable. Some, for example, will not refer to for-profit providers, which can eliminate many good sources of senior housing or services. And they often have little up-to-date information on providers.\\n\\nLocal community-based organizations. An excellent low- or no-cost solution may be a local community-based organization that provides information and referral services. These non-profits often know the best facilities in their communities. Reputable CBOs have no financial conflicts of interest and usually are funded through a mix of philanthropy and government grants.\\n\\nBut their services may be limited. Some may refer you to two or three local options at no cost but they usually don’t have the resources to guide you through each step of the process. Others may provide ongoing case management services for a fee. (Full disclosure; I serve as an unpaid board member of a senior services CBO).\\n\\nCare managers. Sometimes called geriatric care managers or aging life care managers, these fee-based advisors often are trained social workers or nurses (or both). The best are familiar with local services providers and have no financial conflicts.\\n\\nExpect to pay at least a few hundred dollars for an initial assessment and $100/hour and up for ongoing services. But they’ll be helping you make a decision that could cost tens of thousands of dollars and risk the health and wellbeing of your loved one. You can find care managers through the Eldercare Locator or through their trade association here.\\n\\nThe basic rule of thumb for any advisor is simple: They are most likely to represent the interests of whoever is paying them. You want that to be you.\\n\\nIf you take advice from a website that is compensated by businesses it refers to, it will be representing their interests, not yours. You may save a few dollars up front but it will end up costing much more in the long run.

Casey sent the letter to A Place for Mom, which is misleading older adults and their families by claiming that it is an unbiased and no-cost recommendation and referral service for people in search of assisted living facilities. In the letter, Casey references company materials and recent reporting showing that the company’s recommendations are not objective, not safe, and not truly free.\\n\\nRather than offering an unbiased assessment of the best options out of the full set of facilities older adults and their families are choosing from, A Place for Mom only refers to facilities that pay the company a commission.

The site says it helps 700,000 people every year.\\n\\nIt calls itself the nation’s leading “trusted advisory service,” but in reality, A Place for Mom is a referral service that is paid large fees by assisted-living facilities and does not independently assess their records. More than a third of its most highly recommended facilities in 28 states were cited for neglect or substandard care in the past two years, many of them repeatedly, according to a Washington Post review of inspection reports.\\n\\nA Place for Mom awarded these facilities its “Best of Senior Living” award for providing “exemplary care and support to aging loved ones” — based, it said, on user reviews, which are often anonymous. Current and former staff of some large chains said that these reviews are often manipulated by the care providers; some claimed they were encouraged to obtain fake reviews from their own friends and relatives.\\n\\nGet Starting Point\\n\\nA guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\\n\\nEnter Email\\n\\nAs America searches for secure housing for an aging population, assisted living has risen to fill the void, charging an average of $6,000 a month.

Its website pops up immediately when people search the internet for assisted-living facilities. Visitors to the site are asked how much daily assistance they need and the size of their monthly budget and offered a list of recommendations for homes in their area.\\n\\nBut the contrast between A Place for Mom’s recommendations and information contained in state inspection reports can be jarring.\\n\\nFor example, Inspired Living at Bonita Springs in Florida won a “best of” designation from A Place for Mom based on 2023 consumer reviews. Yet in 2022, state inspectors said it failed to protect a resident who died after spending more than an hour unattended on a patio on a midsummer afternoon — when the heat index was 100.4 degrees. The facility’s operator did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe woman was stuck in a wheelchair in direct sunlight, an inspector wrote after reviewing video surveillance footage, and can be seen “wiggling, fidgeting, and bending over at times, but chair remains in the same spot.” Last year, a Post investigation revealed that more than 100 seniors with dementia have died over the past five years after walking away or being left unattended outside assisted-living facilities. Most died from exposure to extreme heat or cold.\\n\\nOther operators stand out for having a large number of facilities on A Place for Mom’s “Best of Senior Living” honor roll despite many citations from state inspectors.\\n\\nCalifornia-based Pacifica Senior Living was cited by inspectors for violations at 23 of its 41 properties on A Place for Mom’s 2023 and 2024 “Best of Senior Living” lists, according to The Post review. They included medication errors, bedsores, falls, staff misconduct, and exposure to hazards such as infestations by scabies and rats. Pacifica did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nMichigan-based StoryPoint was cited at 31 of 69 locations that made A Place for Mom’s “Best of Senior Living” lists for 2023 and 2024, according to state records. StoryPoint Saline has 378 five-star reviews and four mediocre or negative reviews on A Place for Mom. Forty reviews were posted on a single day in March 2021, all with an identical headline “my review of StoryPoint Saline”; 37 of them gave five stars.\\n\\n“That’s not the care that my mom got. That’s not the experience that we had,” said Judy Bottum, whose mother died at a StoryPoint location in Saline, Mich., in January 2023. A state inspection report found no record that Kathleen Bottum had received a single shower in the last month of her life. Staff did not elevate her hospital bed to provide relief from flu symptoms, nor did they administer cold and cough medications. And because staff did not alert family members that she was nearing her final hours, Judy Bottum said, Kathleen Bottum died alone.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSeeing all the accolades on the site, which she did not use to place her mother, “brings up a lot of bad memories and frustration,” Bottum said.\\n\\nStoryPoint did not respond to questions about specific cases or state inspection findings. “We work with the state licensing groups to address any issue or concerns they may have,” the company said in a statement to The Post. “We strive to make our communities the best that they can be through the continuous feedback we receive and openness with those we serve.”\\n\\nA Place for Mom did not respond to repeated questions about why it does not list information from state inspection reports on its website or provide them to families. It said it “strongly encourages” people through its phone advisers to tour assisted-living facilities.\\n\\n“We empower family caregivers with access to information, tools and resources,” A Place for Mom said in response to questions. “We also encourage families to ask questions of each community to ensure they make an informed decision based on their care needs, financial needs and overall preferences.”', '# [A Place for Mom State of Caregiving Survey Reveals Crisis by A Place for Mom on 2023-11-02](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/11/02/2772049/0/en/A-Place-for-Mom-State-of-Caregiving-Survey-Reveals-Crisis-for-Families-Caring-for-Aging-Parents-in-America.html)\\nNEW YORK, Nov. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As November is recognized as National Family Caregivers Month, A Place for Mom (APFM), the trusted advisory service and leading online platform for caregivers seeking senior care options, has released the findings of its 2023 State of Caregiving in the U.S. Survey. In an effort to draw attention to the challenges faced by the 41 million family caregivers in the country, the survey results reveal new and important information about the increasing obstacles caregivers are overcoming, highlighting the pressing need for more support and resources.\\n\\nAccording to the 2023 State of Caregiving Survey from A Place for Mom, 82% of caregivers reported their physical, mental, and financial well-being is at risk, with a large majority putting their parents’ needs above their own. The finding points to an acute caregiving crisis for families caring for aging parents across the country. A staggering 96% of family caregivers feel emotionally drained from the day-to-day challenges of caregiving. And 75% who were employed prior to assuming the caregiver role said they have less time to focus on work or have had to quit their jobs altogether to provide care.\\n\\n“The 2023 State of Caregiving Survey results point to the hard truths that many caregivers face while caring for their aging parents,” said Tatyana Zlotsky, President at A Place for Mom. “Caregivers don’t need to suffer in silence and there are many options that can help them navigate the process. We want to bring awareness to this important issue and ensure that caregivers are aware of resources available to support them as they navigate this complex journey.”\\n\\nHighlights from the 2023 State of Caregiving Survey:*\\n\\nThe Senior Care Dilemma\\n\\nThree out of four people surveyed (76%) were not fully prepared to take on the role of caregiver for their aging parent(s)\\n\\n82% have had to make sacrifices to provide adequate care, putting their own needs behind their parents’ needs, including 39% who have let their own mental health suffer\\n\\nAnd 75% who were employed prior to assuming the caregiver role said they have less time to focus on work or have had to quit their jobs altogether to provide care\\n\\nDespite these personal and professional sacrifices, 68% still feel they cannot always provide the necessary and adequate care\\n\\nFamily Caregivers in Crisis\\n\\nAn overwhelming 96% of caregivers feel emotionally drained from balancing the importance of caregiving with the realities of the day-to-day challenges, and more than half (54%) feel emotionally drained often or all the time\\n\\n61% face the double challenge of caring for their parent or in-law while managing the needs of their children or grandchildren\\n\\nWhile 77% need help from a professional caregiver (at home or in a senior living community), just 27% currently have this professional support\\n\\nMore than 4 in 5 caregivers (84%) find aspects of caregiving and future care planning difficult to navigate, especially understanding the different care options and what is best for their loved one (44%)\\n\\nTime to Prepare for Future Care\\n\\nHaving a greater understanding of the challenges associated with caregiving spurs most caregivers (77%) to proactively take steps to prepare for their own future needs as they age\\n\\n“It’s clear that when families lack the necessary resources to make sure their aging loved ones are safe and well cared for, it can take a tremendous toll on their own personal welfare,” said Sue Johansen, Executive Vice President, Community Network at A Place for Mom. “A Place for Mom provides a critical service to help family caregivers understand and navigate the complexity of finding the right senior solution.”\\n\\nA Place for Mom offers a 24/7 caregiver hotline to provide personalized support and help families weigh their options.

The company connects families seeking senior living options with a network of over 14,000 facilities across the country, although this represents less than half of the total available options, which number approximately 30,600 [(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282). APFM operates under a business model that charges assisted living facilities a commission for successful referrals, which raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the objectivity of its recommendations [(Casey, Senate Committee on Aging, 2024-06-18)](https://www.casey.senate.gov/news/releases/casey-demands-major-assisted-living-facility-referral-service-a-place-for-mom-address-concerns-about-deceptive-marketing-practices).\\n\\n## Recent Developments\\n### Senate Investigation\\nIn June 2024, U.S. Senator Bob Casey initiated an investigation into A Place for Mom, citing allegations of deceptive marketing practices. The senator\\'s letter highlighted concerns that the company misleads families by claiming to be an unbiased and no-cost referral service while primarily referring facilities that pay commissions [(Christman, Senior Housing News, 2024-06-20)](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/06/20/us-senator-probes-a-place-for-mom-alleging-deceptive-practices/). The investigation requests detailed financial information and documentation regarding the company\\'s referral practices, with a response due by July 15, 2024 [(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282).\\n\\n### Leadership Changes\\nIn April 2024, Tatyana Zlotsky was appointed CEO of A Place for Mom, succeeding Larry Kutscher, who transitioned to Chairman of the Board. Zlotsky has been with the company since 2019 and has played a significant role in expanding its home care business and enhancing customer focus [(Zlotsky, Business Wire, 2024-04-15)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tatyana-zlotsky-become-chief-executive-213000087.html).\\n\\n## Product Overview\\nA Place for Mom markets itself as a trusted advisory service for families navigating senior care options. The service is provided at no cost to families, as it is funded by the senior living communities and home care providers in its network [(A Place for Mom, 2023-11-02)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/11/02/2772049/0/en/A-Place-for-Mom-State-of-Caregiving-Survey-Reveals-Crisis-for-Families-Caring-for-Aging-Parents-in-America.html). However, the company\\'s referral model has come under scrutiny for potentially prioritizing facilities that pay higher commissions over those that provide better care.\\n\\n### Quality Concerns\\nRecent analyses, including one by the Washington Post, revealed that approximately 37% of the facilities recognized by A Place for Mom as \"Best of Senior Living\" had been cited for serious violations affecting resident care, including neglect and substandard care [(Montgomery, Washington Post, 2024-05-16)](https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/05/16/washington-post-analysis-links-a-place-for-mom-reviews-awards-with-care-citations/). This raises significant concerns about the integrity of the recommendations provided by A Place for Mom.\\n\\n### Consumer Feedback\\nFeedback on platforms like Reddit tends to be polarized, often reflecting strong opinions, particularly negative ones. While some users report positive experiences with A Place for Mom, others express skepticism about the quality of the facilities recommended, suggesting that the service may prioritize profit over genuine care [(Fool, 2024-05-16)](https://discussion.fool.com/t/a-place-for-mom-is-a-scam/105144).\\n\\n## Financial Performance and Ownership\\nA Place for Mom is currently owned by private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic, which has led to concerns about profit-seeking motives overshadowing the company\\'s mission to assist families in finding quality care [(Bonvissuto, McKnight’s Senior Living, 2024-06-20)](https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/sen-casey-calls-out-a-place-for-mom-over-potentially-deceptive-business-practices/).

Prospective candidates and investors should consider the ongoing investigation by the Senate, the leadership changes, and the potential implications of the company\\'s referral model on consumer trust and care quality. As the industry evolves, transparency and accountability will be critical for A Place for Mom to maintain its position as a trusted resource for families seeking senior care options.'), lineage=Lineage(run_at=datetime.datetime(2024, 10, 14, 9, 55, 31, 304991), git_sha='2b10256'))"
