    "Current, formerly known as GE Current, a Daintree Company, is a prominent player in the lighting industry, specializing in LED technology and intelligent lighting controls. The company was founded on January 1, 2015, following the merger of GE Current and Hubbell's commercial and industrial lighting business (Crunchbase, 2024). Current focuses on sustainability and energy efficiency, offering a wide range of lighting solutions for various sectors, including healthcare, hospitality, education, and industrial markets.\n",
    "\n",

    "Tetra® LED Light Systems: High-performance signage lighting systems.\n",
    "Architectural Area Lighting: Contemporary luminaires for diverse applications.\n",
    "Lighting Controls Systems: Wireless, stand-alone, outdoor, and wired controls.\n",
    "Healthcare Lighting: Products like Remedi and MODx™ for medical environments.\n",
    "Hospitality Lighting: Solutions for hotels and restaurants.\n",
    "Industrial Lighting: High-efficiency luminaires for manufacturing.\n",

    "Tips for Google queries:\n",
    "- It's good to start with a fairly general search, then refine it iteratively based on the results. In other words, start with a higher recall search and then refine it to increase precision\n",
    "- If the company's website is known, you can add related:domain.com to improve precision\n",
    "- If Reddit reviews are promising, we can add site:reddit.com to the query\n",
    "- If results from a source are generally irrelevant, you can exclude that source with -site:source.com\n",
    "- If the company name has multiple words, you can put the name in quotes to increase precision at the cost of recall\n",
    "- Sometimes the informal name of the company may be more useful than the formal name for search queries, for example \"Pomelo\" instead of \"Pomelo Care\" will increase recall but may decrease precision. Likewise \"S6\" instead of \"Singularity 6\" may increase recall but decrease precision\n",
