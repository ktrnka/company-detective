I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1726616551, timestamp_updated=1726616551, voted_up=True, votes_funny=6, votes_up=183, weighted_vote_score=0.8934290409088135, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.\\n\\nCrafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.\\n\\nThe game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.\\n\\nBug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.\\n\\nThe NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.\\n\\nIn fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.\\n\\nThat is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\\n\\nThe housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.\\n\\nGames that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.\\n\\nIn summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)\\n\\nIf i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1726816432, timestamp_updated=1726816432, voted_up=False, votes_funny=1, votes_up=12, weighted_vote_score=0.5619545578956604, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it\\'s again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\\nAnyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\\n\\n1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I\\'d say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\\n\\n2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \\n\\n3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\\nNot just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I\\'ve talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\\nBut, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\\nBy the way,\\nI have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that\\'s really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren\\'t preventable. As for ME, I find the game\\'s lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can\\'t speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\\nSeriously though, thanks for adding this.\\n\\n4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\\n\\n5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can\\'t get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\\n\\n(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\\n6., \\n[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven\\'t fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I\\'d want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can\\'t connect or even care about the plot because it\\'s so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that\\'s meant to be an escape from reality. I don\\'t want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don\\'t want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I\\'d be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can\\'t stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \\n\\n----\\nWhile I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it\\'s still in beta so it\\'s whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it.

It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\\n1. Lack of color. \\nIt's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\\n2. The claustrophobia thing. \\nYour house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\\n3. Maybe lack of realism.\\nYou don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \\n\\nIn the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \\n\\nLong story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia!

It offers an escape from the combat-heavy, fast-paced MMOs and instead focuses on activities like farming, fishing, crafting, and socializing. The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\\n\\nVisuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\\n\\nGameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\\n\\nThe progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\\n\\nCommunity and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\\n\\nThere’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\\n\\nRoom for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\\n\\nAdditionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\\n\\nConclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\\n\\nIf you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1726475017, timestamp_updated=1726475017, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score=0.5199999809265137, written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. \\n\\nI would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.\\n\\nThe multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point?

However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend\\'s character seems to disappear as we run around.

You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play.

      "Not for introverts but extroverts will enjoy. I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing. \n",

Jel has definitely stolen my heart though. ♥ The community is also quite friendly and helpful, which is really nice to see! ♥ I haven't done much socialising though and can comfortably play the game solo or with my partner.

It can be a bit buggy sometimes but it hasn't turned me away from the gameplay at all, in fact, it's hard to stop. I am writing this at 3 am and I really really need to go to sleep but as soon as I wake up I will probably jump right back to it because it's my current hyperfixation. And also I need to talk to Jel.

There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.\n",

      "The housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't.

Want to make your house bigger - money, Want to make your tools better - money. Decorations, plot size, machinery permits, you have to pay money for everything. However the grind doesnt get easier as you progress in the game. You still have only hunting, fishing and mining. Doesnt get much faster, easier or less boring. I find it is normal thing in the begining of game to grind, but there should be oportunity to use machinery to make money later. Also procesed materials should cost more than raw materials, thats just logic. Not in this game! \n",

      "(THis game is still in BETA, and I understand this. This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the \"whys\" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...\n",
      "Anyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:\n",
      "\n",
      "1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???\n",
      "Not just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics \"oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?\" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...\n",
      "But, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.\n",
      "By the way,\n",
      "I have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.\n",
      "Seriously though, thanks for adding this.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!\n",
      "\n",
      "(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)\n",
      "6., \n",
      "[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] \n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "While I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)\n",

      "I've played the game for awhile now but... I still can't decide whether it's a good game or not. Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.\n",
      "But... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:\n",
      "1. Lack of color. \n",
      "It's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?\n",

      "Your house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)\n",
      "3. Maybe lack of realism.\n",
      "You don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... \n",

      "Long story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it?

      "\n",
      "Overview: Palia is a cozy, community-based MMO developed by Singularity 6, blending elements of life simulation and traditional MMORPG gameplay in a relaxing, laid-back environment. It offers an escape from the combat-heavy, fast-paced MMOs and instead focuses on activities like farming, fishing, crafting, and socializing. The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Room for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out. \n",

      "I can't believe this game is free. Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said. \n",

      "This game has been my life for the past month and a half. All of my free time goes into Palia either by hunting, foraging, mining, fishing, gardening, decorating my plots, completing npc/storyline quests, romancing npcs, or playing the addicting game of hot pot. You can collect plushies, and all the star quality fish, bugs, and starstones to display in your house for others to see. The community of players are super friendly and helpful to those who are new to the game. And I love how Palia implements the use of \"teamwork\"(what I refer to it as) where you can party with others to get the same drops from hunting or foraging. Not to mention the use of having flow trees that require multiple players to chop in order to obtain it's wood. There is an endless amount of things to do in this game, all at your own pace. So if you love mmorpgs, farming games, and a nice, relaxing game to hop on after a long day, Palia is definitely for you! :) \n",

As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients.

With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \\n\\nSecond, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \\n\\nThis format just isn’t effective and feels rushed, like you have to stop whatever you’re doing to reply so that you aren’t keeping the visit from ending. It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar.

The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! \\n\\nSo This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.', rating=1, app_version='2.49'),\n",

Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting.

      "All they do is recommend over the counter medication- if you want real help - you’ll still have to go into an office for basic antibiotic prescriptions. Update to first review; two days later - I’ve followed her recommendations and used all the OTC products and I’m still sick - zero improvement, some deterioration. I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.  I was unable to open it because of hardened puss - a sign of a bacterial infection according to CDC. \n",

Let me just say that this is where technology draws the line - getting healthcare over text (which is their primary communication method) seems ineffective. For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store.

      "The app itself is a pretty good concept, however I feel that perhaps some of the doctors they work with could be better? I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab. \n",

They also apparently can only treat any illnesses or infections once, so you’re paying $120 a year plus a $1 a visit to receive absolutely no help. My most recent visit, I wasn’t even looking for a prescription or treatment. I sent details and pictures of the area of concern and all I wanted was advice on whether or not I needed to be seen in person. The doctor rudely told me that he couldn’t help because I was treated for the same thing 7 months ago. He said to continue to do the things I was already doing to treat the problem. No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service.

      "First, let me say that I am 100000000% good with the text-based format, because anyone that knows me can tell you that phone calls are the bane of my existence. With that being said, I had to do a video call with the doctor for my visit before she would start evaluating my issue. It was probably 5 or 10 seconds, nothing long, and then we began texting. I honestly wish we had just finished the visit through the video chat since we had to do it in the beginning anyway. I ended up having to type out long responses while tending to my infant son and trying to get ready for work at the same time. It ended up taking a lot longer than I had anticipated to create all these replies to all the questions she asked. If we already had to do the video chat, I wish we could have just finished the entire visit that way. \n",

      "Second, the reason for my call was an earache. I woke up that morning with my ear killing me. I did a visit on this app and the doctor said to get Flonase and Sudafed and that should help. I asked about antibiotic ear drops and didn’t get any. I realize that my doctor couldn’t actually examine my ear so she couldn’t tell whether or not it was an infection, but honestly what would have been the harm in just giving me some ear drops? I dealt with the problem for 3 more months trying to get the issue to go away with Flonase and Sudafed before I woke up with a stabbing pain in my ear and went to my PCP, and as it turns out I’ve had an ear infection for the past 3 months. I understand not wanting to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily but if have zero complaints about sinus issues, no drainage, doesn’t hurt on the outer ear, and it’s been going on for several weeks, what would have been the harm in some antibiotic ear drops? I don’t think there would have been any harm. \n",

It sounds like it would be conducive to a busy lifestyle but I didn’t find it effective. And the care seems to be subpar. A coworker of mine had a visit the day after mine and she had a sinus infection. The doctor on the app didn’t give her antibiotics either. What do they have against antibiotics?! \n",

      "Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went.

All of them told me to see someone in person or get labs done first??? I’m a female I know what a yeast infection feels like. Honestly this app is just an advertisement for LabCorp/Quest who they’re obviously partnered with because they tried to make me pay for labs or appointments with them every time. I found other apps who will write a simple antifungal rx without forcing labs and appointments down my throat (WHICH NEGATES THE PURPOSE OF MOBILE CARE). Don’t waste your money on this scam. \n",

      "I began using the service bc I am an emergency response COVID19 RN responding to overwhelmed hospitals across the country so I needed to find an alternative to traditional urgent/ primary care. I only actually received a treatment plan that matched my chief complaint & symptoms on my 1st visit. I was so impressed I purchased a year subscription which I later discovered had been a huge waste of $$ & my time which I have very little of these days. Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not! It’s just a waste of time and $$ and you will never be bc able to get a refund on your subscription plan that doesn’t actually exist bc the providers only care about making their $$ \n",

      "Doctor ignored my main issue which is coughing. The prescriptions were for sneezing and running nose which I don’t have. I didn’t realize that until late but I think that was because the doctor pushed too fast. Whole visit was done in less than 2 min. Now I’m doubting whether he really read all information I entered before the visit. He didn’t ask anything about any symptoms during the visit so I thought he was sure. Now thinking about it, it felt like he was just giving out suggestions based on computer result which he didn’t even evaluate. I can be wrong and I hope I’m wrong, but my issue was not really addressed and answered. And there’s not an option on the app to make complaints about doctors so I figured they would just expect me to leave a negative feedback so I did. I don’t recommend this app if you’re serious about your health. \n",
