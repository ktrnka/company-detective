That being said, I\\'m still having a lot of fun with Palia, especially when playing with friends. It\\'s a chill life simulator and I hope they keep it that way.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n- No hostile mobs.\\n- Fishing/hunting/cooking mechanics.\\n- Party buffs.\\n- Animations.\\n- Storage system. No need to run to 8 different chests to find something.\\n- How \\'alive\\' the world is (not talking about multiplayer). We can randomly pick up a quest item and that feels more organic.\\n- House editing. The top-down view is very convenient and I like how we can customise our house layout. Wish the fireplace didn\\'t take up an entire wall though. Also hope we are able to stack rooms in the future since we have a 2nd floor with that bigger Harvest house.\\n- Art style.\\n\\nWhat I hope improves:\\n- Farming is quite slow, hope we get some upgrades that let us automate it a bit.\\n- Storage needs more filters, especially for our furniture.\\n- More interactions with villagers!\\n- More Community function. Maybe a community chest that we can all use to share items.\\n\\nIssues: (some might just be a \"my laptop\" issue)\\n- Lighting glitches out sometimes when the time of day changes.\\n- Animals glitch out when multiple appear out of a tree at the same time.\\n- I crash almost 80% of the time when I first boot up the game. After that it runs smoothly.\\n- Bugs (insects) sometimes clip under the floor. (not talking about them despawning)\\n- Desync issues (animals/players) especially when in a party.\\n- Hair colour bug. (primary and secondary swap places and primary doesn\\'t show up)\\n- World not loading in randomly. (ground to the mines disappears. when I enter a room, all the furniture goes into the void)\\n- Chat box flickering randomly.\\n- Texture bugs.

I decided to get two outfits yesterday upon one i really liked being released and they put the outfit in game and set it at 1700 in game coins which is ... A lot for a person of below average income but i said oh well it will make me happy BECAUSE  the game makes me happy and so i bit the bullet... Only to feel like a complete  FOOL when not even a few hours later they cut the prices down on the two outfits i bought full price IN LITERAL HALF just after i bought them for double the price. without ZERO NOTICE or NEWS ALERT... Feeling literally scammed out of my money THAT i could have literally stretched and gotten more out of and quite frankly like i just got ripped off considering they gave ZERO news alerts about the outfits being reduced in price AND ETC... but hey i guess they were dirty like that and most likely did it on purpose... im sure theres more folks like me feeling absolutely blind-sighted by the price-drop they did shortly after releasing it at a high one....like its absolutely ridiculous.... Literally any player who would have known would have waited to get it for half the price the same day it was released OBVIOUSLY but noooo. They gave ZERO NOTICE nor NEWS ALERTS IN GAME about this pricedrop ...ONLY ABOUT IT BEING RELEASED.... money grabbed players upon its immediate release at 1700 ... oh and the other outfit i got they cut down from 1275 to 678 or something just for even more collateral damage to my feelings of the purchases i regret more then anything now. \\n\\nIt wouldnt have even bothered me if they atleast gave notice or immediatly released the outfits at the cutdown price. Its the principal of the matter and their antic  that literally TURNED ME STRAIGHT OFF from even wanting to play the game after feeling scammed like im sure others who did the same thing i did feel... the only thing that would make me feel better about it is if they corrected the wrong doing and made me feel whole which i have yet to hear back about after foling a ticket. Like that antic literally just costed them a consumer that was happy to support the game in the future with upcoming packs and etc.... Aint no way ill ever spend another penny on this game again just for the rug-pull of a move they did with the new outfit releast today. Nope. Thats hurtful to your customers. I dont get why they would even do that....\\n\\nsmh ... Disappointed is an understatement for what they did. I get its a free game but i cant believe this game doing this to the ones that DO support them ?\\n\\nThey literally ....\\n\\nReleased New out fit at double the price and then dropped it to half in not even a few hours.... YEAH I FEEL BAD FOR US PLAYERS WHO GOT PLAYED... good job????! like all u guys did was hurt the people who support you by doing that to not one but two of the outfits.... not nice.... Had it been made aware in game via the news alerts i wouldnt even be mad and take that L but yeah...

The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \\nThere are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They\\'re okay. It\\'s not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn\\'t hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn\\'t hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don\\'t hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don\\'t make it very exciting to play. \\n\\nIt\\'s an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn\\'t bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \\n\\nFor a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don\\'t feel inviting at all. I can\\'t be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn\\'t well designed. \\n\\nI have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn\\'t enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It\\'s just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don\\'t change, I don\\'t recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \\n\\nAgain, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you\\'re making a game and when you\\'re designing the way the story is being told.

(What a waste of 50k) \\n\\n- Gold Cap: I see no actual purpose forcing people to be gold capped at 999,999 (Previously 300,000) and then having an accomplishment to earn 100,000,000 gold.\\n\\n- Tool Durability: Why aren't upgraded tools not pushed into a broken state instead of downgrading them when overused? It seems rather lazy/boring to force people to remake their tools with their resources if they just so happen to not be paying full attention to their durability rather than just going to repair the item. \\n\\n- Premium Currency: While I understand the developers need to make money to keep their game running, some of the outfits are absurdly expensive for a game that's in beta and I believe it would be a good addition to introduce ways to earn that currency in-game through participation in-game.\\n\\n- Lack of trading/marketplace: One of the main concerns that I am reading as to why people are gate-keeping the idea of trading or having a marketplace in this game falls upon the economy being ruined by people gold-selling or gold-buying and truthfully while that can be used as a solid argument there are already numerous ways people are cheating to get ahead in the game and have ways to bypass the current 'request' system using hacks. \\n\\n- Character Creation: Please give us more ways to customise our characters (especially males) and please add a blonde hair colour!\\n\\nI truly don't think Palia is a bad game.

ALL cosmetic items such as clothing and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color schemes as well. pets are also purchased with real money. i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money (seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn\\'t tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely). but i am not willing to shell out $20+, that being on the LOW end of the price ranges, on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what\\'s been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics. just because fortnite does it, doesn\\'t mean you should! i exited and uninstalled palia due to my disappointment the moment i figured out you cannot obtain cosmetics or pets without paying a stupid amount of money. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this, and i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that\\'s supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\\n\\ntldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don\\'t want to open your wallet, because ALL cosmetic items are paid for with real money and are very expensive, and this includes pets. there are no pets that do not cost real money, and a limited number of boring clothes in the character creator. the lack of pets and cosmetics is a huge blow to the game and as such there is not much to work toward, since there is not that much to do and not many players around. the character customization is extremely lacking and one of the worst i have seen. if you want to play anyway i\\'d still be wary about spending real money if i were you, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \\n\\nwho knows. with any luck, maybe this will turn into something better at some point in its future, if it has one.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722829071, timestamp_updated=1722904709, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=6, weighted_vote_score='0.51069408655166626', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.\\n\\nHowever, the game also has plenty of problems.\\n- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.\\n- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.\\n- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.\\n- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.\\n- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.\\n\\nMy recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722546795, timestamp_updated=1722547037, voted_up=False, votes_funny=6, votes_up=136, weighted_vote_score='0.835017800331115723', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.\\n\\nThe gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.\\n\\nDespite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.\\n\\nThe game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\\n\\nWhile Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.\\n\\nPalia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using \"Palia Coins.\" Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I\\'ve spent upwards of $150.\\n\\nAn easy way to earn gold coins in the game is through cake/cooking parties. However, these sessions can become monotonous, requiring long periods of repetitive button and mouse clicking, which can detract from the overall enjoyment.\\n\\nPalia lays the groundwork for a charming and engaging community simulation game but is held back by technical issues, repetitive content, and limited social interactions. The game may appeal to players looking for a relaxing, casual experience, but it could benefit from more content, expanded customization options, and improved social features to maintain long-term interest.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1722325911, timestamp_updated=1722325911, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score='0.527559041976928711', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

I was looking for something cute, relaxing, and farming-like but with more world exploration options, and this hits the spot just right. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy personal favorites:\\r\\n- Building: There\\'s so much freedom in building your home, it\\'s crazy. I love how immersive it is. You can customize your home to such tiny details as where and how you place your books. \\r\\n- Crafting: As above with building, you have tons of options and items that you can craft, and every time you craft a new item, you can learn more. Everything can be used to decorate your home/land. Or you can give them to the villagers as gifts. \\r\\n- Farming: I love that you don\\'t just click a button and everything appears or grows. You have to really FARM. The plants will grow over time and require water, and they\\'ll sometimes give you seeds. You can gather wildflowers from your world explorations and get the seeds and grow the plant on your property as well. I don\\'t know if there will be animals though. It doesn\\'t seem so. You can also buy seeds from the farmer NPC.\\r\\n- Fishing: Fishing seems straightforward enough, but it isn\\'t easy for everyone. Once I learned how to do it, I love it now. You can use fish for cooking, gifting, or even put it in a fish tank on your own property. \\r\\n- Cooking: I don\\'t have much to say about this, but I love it when you can cook in games and gather recipes. Food can be used to restore your energy or as a gift.\\r\\n- Wardrobe: You\\'re not stuck with the same looks forever. Change your clothing, hair, and accessories. The default ones are for free, but you can make an in-game purchase for cooler items, pets, and whatnot. \\r\\n- Friendships: The village has a number of NPCs, each with their own unique personality and story. They are NOT static. Each one has their own routine, the places they visit, and you see them moving around a lot. For those who love immersion, I think it\\'s perfect. They will only stay in the same place if it\\'s their \"job\" but they also get their free time and go to bed at night. Besides that, befriending different villagers gives you different perks/items/skills/etc.\\r\\n- Romance: I haven\\'t gotten this far, but I noticed that some of the NPCs have an additional icon for romance, which unlocks after you get Lvl 3 in friendship. I don\\'t know if marriage is an option, but I hope so. Oh, and the game doesn\\'t filter if you play as a female or male character.\\r\\n- Village: The village itself is very cute, with various shops and secret places that you can find. Every time I feel like I\\'ve seen everything, I still find something new, something secret.\\r\\n- Secrets: You can stumble onto books, letters, strange items, and secret places. There are tons of things to discover.\\r\\n- Player Farms: You can visit other players\\' homes and wow, they\\'re so beautiful and creative.\\r\\n- Immortality: You can\\'t die. You can run out of energy, but you won\\'t die if you fall from a cliff. Yay. Oh, and nobody attacks you. Wolves run from you and hide ON THE TREES, which I found so funny. For me, it\\'s a big plus when I want cozy games and not having to think about survival.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther things you can do that I personally feel neutral about:\\r\\n- Mining and wood chopping: You can gather the required materials all over the world. It\\'s part of immersion, but I don\\'t love it and don\\'t hate it either. \\r\\n- Hunting: I personally don\\'t like hunting when some of the animals are SO CUTE. Why would I want to kill it? The game, however, doesn\\'t seem to force it. You have quests that involve gathering meat, but I just bought it in the store without killing the cute animals (although technically it\\'s still dead? Hmm...Okay, let\\'s not question my moralities. :D). \\r\\n- Catching bugs: Same as with fishing, you can catch all sorts of bugs and use them as gifts (yes, some NPCs think it\\'s a fantastic gift), put them in your home and...okay, maybe not for cooking. But you can sell them, so you get money for those worms and whatever. Yay.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\n- Uh...I can\\'t think of any. The only thing I dislike about the existing things is hunting cute animals, but that\\'s life, so it\\'s not a problem as long as it stays optional in the game and quests have workarounds like buying the item instead of going for the kill. \\r\\n- Oh, and you can\\'t swim. There\\'s plenty of water but you get respawned nearby if you get inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:\\r\\n- The game is quite immersive for something this cozy (and free), but I feel like it would benefit from letting the player sit or interact with other items that aren\\'t on their own property. You craft a bench and put it in your house—sure, sit on it until your rear falls off. But why can\\'t I sit on a bench in the village? What if I want my rear to fall off there, not on my own property? Or if I visit the inn, why not let me sit at the table? Okay, I get why I can\\'t walk into a stranger\\'s house and empty their fridge, but why can\\'t I sit at the inn? Or read the books at the library? I mean, I don\\'t need to actually read random paragraphs, but an animation with a rising skill would be lovely, for example, if i pick up a book about fishing or something along those lines.\\r\\n- I can buy/craft a musical instrument, but I can\\'t play it. It would be fun if artistic activities were optional just as much as cooking or whatever else in the game. For example, when you complete quests or speak daily to the NPCs, you get reputation points. Playing an instrument that I\\'ve crafted could affect it. Maybe my instruments even squeak while I have a low skill and then get better over time just like crafting recipes and stuff. \\r\\n- SWIMMING!!! I don\\'t need a deep sea experience, but being respawned every time I wet my feet is quite annoying when I could just swim over. I understand that this might serve a purpose of not letting me near a place that\\'s supposed to be hard to get to, but I think other obstacles would have been better. You gave us so many nice places and the game is cozy, why not let some players swim away their daily worries, even if just aimlessly? It would add up to the existing immersion.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhew.

If you farm a node near someone else, they can collect it when you are done, or you can farm it together and save on durability.  If someone is in your party and you both farm a node, or are in close proximity, you each have a chance to double the material you find.  So that's 4 times as much than if you were by yourself for just 2 people.  Party size of up to 4.  \\n\\nAlso, there is no health bar.  There is no fall damage, there is no drowning, no sleeping; for players.  The NPCs sleep but you can still interact with them by going to their homes, even when sleeping.  It's kind of a cool game.\\n\\nI don't know about the future of this game.  I know there has been a known issue with one of the quests, a pretty important issue for a much involved quest.  There are about 700 people who have put in requests for it to be repaired over the last 6 months, and it hasn't been closed.  People have said they are in transition, the company sold to someone else.

This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\\r\\n2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\\r\\n3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\\r\\n4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\\r\\n5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\\r\\n6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \\r\\n7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \\r\\n8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \\r\\n9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \\r\\n10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\\r\\n11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\\r\\n12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\\r\\n13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \\r\\n14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \\r\\n15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \\r\\n16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\\r\\n17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\\r\\n18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \\r\\n19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\\r\\n20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\\r\\n21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721799278, timestamp_updated=1721799278, voted_up=True, votes_funny=19, votes_up=379, weighted_vote_score='0.848982393741607666', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

To me it seems like a combination of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing but with interactions between players.  The graphics are really nice and the game play seems fairly intuitive. I haven't had any connection issues or anything like that, but I also don't have any friends that are playing this game. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite not knowing anyone in the game, People seem to be willing to help out.  I love that everyone is so nice and accommodating. There is a quest were you have to fulfill another player's request, if there isn't any up, players are usually willing to put up some easy requests for you so that you can complete that quest. Furthermore, if you're missing a pretty common ingredient, for say cooking or furniture building, players are pretty good at filling those requests. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have gotten far enough in the game that I can now get some of the higher quality and rarer ingredients, and I love that players use the flares and call out in chat where those rarer ingredients are on the map.  It is so helpful and I love the way it makes you feel immersed into the game, like you really are apart of this community. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am so impressed that I have played over thirty hours of game play and haven't really felt the need to pay for anything, so far. Everything in the store seems to be mostly cosmetic, that being said, I still plan on getting something small, just because some of the cosmetic Items are cute, especially the pets. For those who don't want to spend anything, I still think that you can enjoy the game without paying anything, which is always awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read complaints about how slow the progression is, I don't feel that the game is slow in progressing at all.  I think the pacing of the game is very well done, especially for a crafting/farming mmo, to me the slower progress seems intentional so that players don't feel like they have done everything that there is to do in just a week of playing.\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721670570, timestamp_updated=1721670570, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score='0.523809552192687988', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

There is literally nothing to lose by downloading and giving it a try.... oooother than your valuable time.\\n\\nWhen I saw I only had 10 hours to show, I couldn\\'t believe it. The crafting and gathering and running out of space and selling and rinse and repeat is somewhat tedious.\\nTo build your first house you need roughly 150 minutes worth of crafted materials - 150 items that needed to be gathered first. Now - to be fair - you leave it to craft - go offline or do some questing or some more grinding (Just remember the limited inventory) but then once you put the resources into the house - you still have to wait a long time for it to be built - which increases with every add on.\\n \\nThe inventory is something that left me confused - though I found out later that this was user error, the beige, white and light yellow wallpapers gifted to me were the same colour as the inventory and appeared to be empty spaces.\\n\\nThis does lead me to my next point though which is honestly confusion - as a beginner at this game, you are guided through all the typical points of Game Play WASD, Space Bar, How to climb etc. All the slightly more complicated things like fishing are explained with the use of overly wordy graphics. But then you get to the game mechanics that are specific to the game - such as catching bugs - which again is explained by overly wordy graphics when you get the quest - with no easy way to retrieve the information again when you actually need it (Again - this could be attributed to user error.)\\n\\nThe housing system is actually quite neat - and exactly why I was looking for this style of \"MMO.\" But Farming - is again extremely grindy - and you have to keep purchasing seeds with coins - that is until you upgrade enough to by the seed making machine. (I haven\\'t bought it yet.)\\n\\nGold - Illustrious gold. Another grind - took me a while to earn gold. Now - should currency be easy to get? Not necessarily. But I do think that it is perhaps a little unbalanced when you spend 200 + gold for a quest, only to receive like 50 in return.\\n\\nLastly of my negative review - is there a reason for multiplayer? Not in the least. I haven\\'t seen the negativity in the chats that other people are mentioning. but that really feels like all you do as a collaborative effort - chat, ask for stuff and occasionally party up for the occasional difficult tree and mob... I was hoping for something perhaps a teensy bit more community driven - Think Hay Day style with selling things from your plot - boy did I get excited seeing that bin.\\n\\nNow all this to say that I have actually dedicated 10 hours to see if I liked it - I love the bug catching, super cute and cool you can populate your house enough to make entomophobes weep. The placement of furniture, as far as this style of game goes is very versatile. The storyline is not too bad - though it really feels unpopulated by NPCs who actually have important things to do - not that I was looking for another \"MMO\" that asks you to \"retrieve 20 of this\". But the story is really only centred around the scientist lady. Oh, and I love the loot chests - especially getting to keep the chests - even if they aren\\'t functional. Oh yes - what is the point of the pantry for your veggies if all you can do is open and close the door?\\n\\nI would like to continue exploring a little more - I am playing alongside my siblings so perhaps I will discover some more along the way - though the party system is feeble at best.', steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1721590854, timestamp_updated=1721591677, voted_up=False, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score='0.504504501819610596', written_during_early_access=False, developer_response=None, timestamp_dev_responded=None),\n",

And over all, this game is just super enjoyable to play. There is a main story line and quests to do as well. And the npcs are unique and well done (and you can romance some of them).\\n\\nBut there is a bit that the game is lacking in my opinion. I would like to see more quests and ones you can actually do with friends. More farming plots (you are only allowed 9 total plots that have 9 slots each to plant on). Something actually done with the community/guild system. The ability to share a house or housing plot with your friends or community. More cooking options and crops to grow. More animals to hunt. And the ability to have livestock type animals.

      "Firstly I have to mention that this game is still new and needs a bit of polishing. That being said, I'm still having a lot of fun with Palia, especially when playing with friends. It's a chill life simulator and I hope they keep it that way.\n",

      "What I like:\n",
      "- No hostile mobs.\n",
      "- Fishing/hunting/cooking mechanics.\n",
      "- Party buffs.\n",
      "- Animations.\n",
      "- Storage system. No need to run to 8 different chests to find something.\n",
      "- How 'alive' the world is (not talking about multiplayer). We can randomly pick up a quest item and that feels more organic.\n",
      "- House editing. The top-down view is very convenient and I like how we can customise our house layout. Wish the fireplace didn't take up an entire wall though. Also hope we are able to stack rooms in the future since we have a 2nd floor with that bigger Harvest house.\n",
      "- Art style.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I hope improves:\n",
      "- Farming is quite slow, hope we get some upgrades that let us automate it a bit.\n",
      "- Storage needs more filters, especially for our furniture.\n",
      "- More interactions with villagers!\n",
      "- More Community function. Maybe a community chest that we can all use to share items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Issues: (some might just be a \"my laptop\" issue)\n",
      "- Lighting glitches out sometimes when the time of day changes.\n",
      "- Animals glitch out when multiple appear out of a tree at the same time.\n",
      "- I crash almost 80% of the time when I first boot up the game. After that it runs smoothly.\n",
      "- Bugs (insects) sometimes clip under the floor. (not talking about them despawning)\n",
      "- Desync issues (animals/players) especially when in a party.\n",
      "- Hair colour bug. (primary and secondary swap places and primary doesn't show up)\n",
      "- World not loading in randomly. (ground to the mines disappears. when I enter a room, all the furniture goes into the void)\n",
      "- Chat box flickering randomly.\n",
      "- Texture bugs. (I see large square sand textures on the floor instead of grass. Icons having a green/red square around it.)\n",

      "This rocks! This is just like Stardew Valley and Sun Haven. You mine, fish, farm, cook, build your house and furniture, romance characters, do quests,  kill creatures, harvest plants and cut trees. You can be in a poly relationship. I'm not sure if you can marry anyone but they can be your lover. You can play with your friends like WoW. There isn't any fighting over resources when you play with your friends because even if you are working on the same tree, rock, quests, or plant, everyone receives the same resources. You can fast travel from anywhere in Palia to your home lot. You can have gliders to fly, pets, and outfits that are just for show. Fishing is a lot easier then in Stawdew Valley or Sun Haven. \n",

Turned out the house decorating system is great and I'm also dying to get to know the villagers' backstories (the emotional baggage will end me). The daily schedule of villagers gives the player the impression of a living village, with npcs having their duties and habits. There's also romance. <3 For those who get bored fast Palia has a bunch of minigames, including simple but fun temple puzzles, arcade, agility tests and a game of cards you play with other players. The community is friendly and very helpful. Overall 10/10 cozy game to relax after a long day of trying to earn for a house irl.\n",

      "The problem with this game overall is theres not enough information given to players about whats going on and what there is to look forward to and etc. LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND NEWS ALERTS THAT INFORM PLAYERS OF WHATS TO COME AND TO STAY TUNED FOR WITH NO TIME IN ADVANCE TO CONSIDER WHICH LEAVES PLAYERS FEELING SCAMMED TO THE POINT THEY DO NOT EVEN WANT TO PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE LET ALONE SUPPORT IT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN MADE TO FEEL REGRET AND LIKE A FOOL AFTER SAID PURCHASE TO HELP SUPPORT SAID GAME..\n",
      "\n",
      "For example. I decided to get two outfits yesterday upon one i really liked being released and they put the outfit in game and set it at 1700 in game coins which is ... A lot for a person of below average income but i said oh well it will make me happy BECAUSE  the game makes me happy and so i bit the bullet... Only to feel like a complete  FOOL when not even a few hours later they cut the prices down on the two outfits i bought full price IN LITERAL HALF just after i bought them for double the price. without ZERO NOTICE or NEWS ALERT... Feeling literally scammed out of my money THAT i could have literally stretched and gotten more out of and quite frankly like i just got ripped off considering they gave ZERO news alerts about the outfits being reduced in price AND ETC... but hey i guess they were dirty like that and most likely did it on purpose... im sure theres more folks like me feeling absolutely blind-sighted by the price-drop they did shortly after releasing it at a high one....like its absolutely ridiculous.... Literally any player who would have known would have waited to get it for half the price the same day it was released OBVIOUSLY but noooo. They gave ZERO NOTICE nor NEWS ALERTS IN GAME about this pricedrop ...ONLY ABOUT IT BEING RELEASED.... money grabbed players upon its immediate release at 1700 ... oh and the other outfit i got they cut down from 1275 to 678 or something just for even more collateral damage to my feelings of the purchases i regret more then anything now. \n",

      "It wouldnt have even bothered me if they atleast gave notice or immediatly released the outfits at the cutdown price. Its the principal of the matter and their antic  that literally TURNED ME STRAIGHT OFF from even wanting to play the game after feeling scammed like im sure others who did the same thing i did feel... the only thing that would make me feel better about it is if they corrected the wrong doing and made me feel whole which i have yet to hear back about after foling a ticket. Like that antic literally just costed them a consumer that was happy to support the game in the future with upcoming packs and etc.... Aint no way ill ever spend another penny on this game again just for the rug-pull of a move they did with the new outfit releast today. Nope. Thats hurtful to your customers. I dont get why they would even do that....\n",

      "\n",
      "Released New out fit at double the price and then dropped it to half in not even a few hours.... YEAH I FEEL BAD FOR US PLAYERS WHO GOT PLAYED... good job????! like all u guys did was hurt the people who support you by doing that to not one but two of the outfits.... not nice.... Had it been made aware in game via the news alerts i wouldnt even be mad and take that L but yeah... LACK OF COMMUNICATION ON GAME STAFF BEHALF and just wanting to make people spend more to spend more and then doing that to them...  Imagine making your supporters feel STUPID? smh.....\n",

      "I really wanted to like Palia, but I couldn't stay excited about it past release. The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? \n",
      "There are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They're okay. It's not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn't hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn't hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don't hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don't make it very exciting to play. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn't bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don't feel inviting at all. I can't be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn't well designed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn't enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It's just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don't change, I don't recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question \"is this fun?\" when you're making a game and when you're designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it's just not quite enough. So far, Palia isn't more than a good base for a game.\n",

You can't interact with them outside of typing in chat which is rarely used unless you go outside of the main map. If you stayed in the main map, you would think they were bots. From what I've seen, the only thing you can actually do with other people is hunt, collect and fish together. It doesn't look like you can do much of the \"co-op\" experience. Everyone I've come across and spoken to has been very friendly. But yeah, if you expected a co-op experience where you could do everything with your friend, this is not it. \n",

It's extremely annoying to have to click on every character in my friendship tab to remember what it was they wanted. A list of all the wants besides the characters name would be great. It's unbelievably annoying that if you gift someone something before you ask them what they want, you now have to wait an entire real life day to give them what they said they wanted. IMO, the method Stardew Valley uses of the two gifts per week + whatever they say they want/need would be much better here. \n",

Packed full of adventurous quests and tasks friendly and the not so friendly townsfolk,you meet many along the way and soon learn their likes and dislikes within different tasks requested of your character. As you progress further into game play you can upgrade your weapons,bow,arrows by crafting better ones and even repairing the basic models once you've learned the recipes to do so. Crafting,fishing,hunting,gardening,cooking,puzzle based quests,etc is some of the exciting activities here. Takes a bit of foraging and mining to get your character's skills to level up but it is well worth the wait once you receive the glider.

      "I don't speak for everyone in this game as there are a lot of people who very much enjoy the current mechanics and we are all entitled to our own opinions but as someone new to the game and getting slightly obsessed I'm just expressing a few things that have just completely frustrated me. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Limited Storage: I don't like how we are forced to essentially throw away items that we have farmed in order to preserve space, if I have spent hours farming for materials in a specific zone while levelling up my skills or even while trying to hunt a rare bug then I want to be able to keep a large portion of my supplies gathered rather than feeling forced to throw it into the shipping bin or convert it into planks, bars, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Limited Farm Plots: One of the few things I was getting quite excited about was making a primary housing estate and then making a farm house on a secondary plot.. however after further investigation this wasn't possible due to being limited on the amount of farming plots I'm allowed to allocate to my property. (What a waste of 50k) \n",
      "\n",
      "- Gold Cap: I see no actual purpose forcing people to be gold capped at 999,999 (Previously 300,000) and then having an accomplishment to earn 100,000,000 gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Tool Durability: Why aren't upgraded tools not pushed into a broken state instead of downgrading them when overused? It seems rather lazy/boring to force people to remake their tools with their resources if they just so happen to not be paying full attention to their durability rather than just going to repair the item. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Premium Currency: While I understand the developers need to make money to keep their game running, some of the outfits are absurdly expensive for a game that's in beta and I believe it would be a good addition to introduce ways to earn that currency in-game through participation in-game.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Lack of trading/marketplace: One of the main concerns that I am reading as to why people are gate-keeping the idea of trading or having a marketplace in this game falls upon the economy being ruined by people gold-selling or gold-buying and truthfully while that can be used as a solid argument there are already numerous ways people are cheating to get ahead in the game and have ways to bypass the current 'request' system using hacks. \n",

      "i don't usually leave reviews but i was so taken aback by just how poor several key aspects of this game are i feel compelled. you should take any money you might have spent on this game's insanely overpriced cosmetics and find yourself something else. there are plenty of games that do well what palia is attempting and failing to do. this studio has gone through massive layoffs a few times now and an acquisition recently so this game may not have much time left anyway. from reading other reviews from people who have been playing since alpha, the devs are also actively hostile towards the players and have been on more than one occasion on blog posts and on discord, including threatening to make the game worse on purpose, that's always a good sign...\n",
      "it should also be noted i absolutely do not hate this game for being \"woke\" and i, as someone who would be considered \"woke\" through my sheer existence, actually have no idea what so many simpletons in the reviews are referring to as \"woke\" unless they mean the fact that... you can play as a black person? there are women in the game? there are characters with locs? you can date any villager? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a hyper macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, that isn't the game's fault nor is it \"woke\", and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you'd feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is \"woke\", i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let's continue on.\n",
      "\n",
      "just tried this out for a few hours and it was kind of fun gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small and visually not very interesting. the art style and design for the player character is generic. there's not much to do or work toward. you can chop down trees and break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops, fish or catch bugs, craft items, decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you'll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers. i will say what there is available to do is pretty chill, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game's other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there. perhaps if you are brand spanking new to games like this i could understand.\n",
      "the biggest issue for me, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired; especially compared to the diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i'm basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creator options whatsoever.\n",
      "i figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute clothing. i was wrong! you CANNOT obtain any clothes! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothing and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color schemes as well. pets are also purchased with real money. i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money (seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn't tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely). but i am not willing to shell out $20+, that being on the LOW end of the price ranges, on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what's been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics. just because fortnite does it, doesn't mean you should! i exited and uninstalled palia due to my disappointment the moment i figured out you cannot obtain cosmetics or pets without paying a stupid amount of money. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this, and i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that's supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?\n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don't want to open your wallet, because ALL cosmetic items are paid for with real money and are very expensive, and this includes pets. there are no pets that do not cost real money, and a limited number of boring clothes in the character creator. the lack of pets and cosmetics is a huge blow to the game and as such there is not much to work toward, since there is not that much to do and not many players around. the character customization is extremely lacking and one of the worst i have seen. if you want to play anyway i'd still be wary about spending real money if i were you, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. \n",

You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time.

I LOVE the beautiful graphics and the challenge of figuring out how to play without a lot of game guides next to me. What I haven't enjoyed is my computer crashing on me because my graphics card isn't hefty enough to handle this game. It's a good thing I'm not a serious gamer. I'm able to tone down my details and still have stunning gameplay. Maybe make this more normal person PC friendly? Otherwise, I'm happy to play for hours!! The kid in me woke up! :)\n",

      "Palia is a community simulation game that offers players a cozy and engaging experience in a vibrant world. Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.\n",

      "Palia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using \"Palia Coins.\" Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I've spent upwards of $150.\n",

      "Im a new player, not even a month in and im hooked! Me and my girlfriend are playing day and night when we have the chance. There is so much fun things to do. She loves doing the quest while I like racking up coins. Then we come together and skill because it shares loot and experience. Im a experience gamer and she is new to gaming so she has a hard time shooting anything fast or jumping to anything quick. She also cant stick to a game after 2 days because she gets bored or overwhelm. But!!! She can play Palia all day every day because the game is easy to maneuver. I like how the creatures to hunt are not dangerous to the player and you will never get killed. Also we like that we dont have to constantly be eating and looking for food in this game unlike other games we played. With that being said whether your a beginner or a experienced gamer you should give this a shot. No pay to win option and its free so join the community everyone here is friendly.\n",

      "What a lovely, cozy game! I was looking for something cute, relaxing, and farming-like but with more world exploration options, and this hits the spot just right. \n",
      "\n",
      "My personal favorites:\n",
      "- Building: There's so much freedom in building your home, it's crazy. I love how immersive it is. You can customize your home to such tiny details as where and how you place your books. \n",
      "- Crafting: As above with building, you have tons of options and items that you can craft, and every time you craft a new item, you can learn more. Everything can be used to decorate your home/land. Or you can give them to the villagers as gifts. \n",
      "- Farming: I love that you don't just click a button and everything appears or grows. You have to really FARM. The plants will grow over time and require water, and they'll sometimes give you seeds. You can gather wildflowers from your world explorations and get the seeds and grow the plant on your property as well. I don't know if there will be animals though. It doesn't seem so. You can also buy seeds from the farmer NPC.\n",
      "- Fishing: Fishing seems straightforward enough, but it isn't easy for everyone. Once I learned how to do it, I love it now. You can use fish for cooking, gifting, or even put it in a fish tank on your own property. \n",
      "- Cooking: I don't have much to say about this, but I love it when you can cook in games and gather recipes. Food can be used to restore your energy or as a gift.\n",
      "- Wardrobe: You're not stuck with the same looks forever. Change your clothing, hair, and accessories. The default ones are for free, but you can make an in-game purchase for cooler items, pets, and whatnot. \n",
      "- Friendships: The village has a number of NPCs, each with their own unique personality and story. They are NOT static. Each one has their own routine, the places they visit, and you see them moving around a lot. For those who love immersion, I think it's perfect. They will only stay in the same place if it's their \"job\" but they also get their free time and go to bed at night. Besides that, befriending different villagers gives you different perks/items/skills/etc.\n",
      "- Romance: I haven't gotten this far, but I noticed that some of the NPCs have an additional icon for romance, which unlocks after you get Lvl 3 in friendship. I don't know if marriage is an option, but I hope so. Oh, and the game doesn't filter if you play as a female or male character.\n",
      "- Village: The village itself is very cute, with various shops and secret places that you can find. Every time I feel like I've seen everything, I still find something new, something secret.\n",
      "- Secrets: You can stumble onto books, letters, strange items, and secret places. There are tons of things to discover.\n",
      "- Player Farms: You can visit other players' homes and wow, they're so beautiful and creative.\n",
      "- Immortality: You can't die. You can run out of energy, but you won't die if you fall from a cliff. Yay. Oh, and nobody attacks you. Wolves run from you and hide ON THE TREES, which I found so funny. For me, it's a big plus when I want cozy games and not having to think about survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other things you can do that I personally feel neutral about:\n",
      "- Mining and wood chopping: You can gather the required materials all over the world. It's part of immersion, but I don't love it and don't hate it either. \n",
      "- Hunting: I personally don't like hunting when some of the animals are SO CUTE. Why would I want to kill it? The game, however, doesn't seem to force it. You have quests that involve gathering meat, but I just bought it in the store without killing the cute animals (although technically it's still dead? Hmm...Okay, let's not question my moralities. :D). \n",
      "- Catching bugs: Same as with fishing, you can catch all sorts of bugs and use them as gifts (yes, some NPCs think it's a fantastic gift), put them in your home and...okay, maybe not for cooking. But you can sell them, so you get money for those worms and whatever. Yay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Uh...I can't think of any. The only thing I dislike about the existing things is hunting cute animals, but that's life, so it's not a problem as long as it stays optional in the game and quests have workarounds like buying the item instead of going for the kill. \n",
      "- Oh, and you can't swim. There's plenty of water but you get respawned nearby if you get inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPERS:\n",
      "- The game is quite immersive for something this cozy (and free), but I feel like it would benefit from letting the player sit or interact with other items that aren't on their own property. You craft a bench and put it in your house—sure, sit on it until your rear falls off. But why can't I sit on a bench in the village? What if I want my rear to fall off there, not on my own property? Or if I visit the inn, why not let me sit at the table? Okay, I get why I can't walk into a stranger's house and empty their fridge, but why can't I sit at the inn? Or read the books at the library? I mean, I don't need to actually read random paragraphs, but an animation with a rising skill would be lovely, for example, if i pick up a book about fishing or something along those lines.\n",
      "- I can buy/craft a musical instrument, but I can't play it. It would be fun if artistic activities were optional just as much as cooking or whatever else in the game. For example, when you complete quests or speak daily to the NPCs, you get reputation points. Playing an instrument that I've crafted could affect it. Maybe my instruments even squeak while I have a low skill and then get better over time just like crafting recipes and stuff. \n",
      "- SWIMMING!!! I don't need a deep sea experience, but being respawned every time I wet my feet is quite annoying when I could just swim over. I understand that this might serve a purpose of not letting me near a place that's supposed to be hard to get to, but I think other obstacles would have been better. You gave us so many nice places and the game is cozy, why not let some players swim away their daily worries, even if just aimlessly? It would add up to the existing immersion.\n",

No delete & re-create character option? Really? It's SO fundamental for any game. How could they 'not' have such an obvious option? Lol. So dumb. Guess I'll shelve the game and go play something else. Oh well.

      "The game was fun and chill for a start but I've literally done everything you CAN do and there's nothing left. the lack of areas to explore gets old quickly and I have now abandoned it as there is no longer anything to work towards.\n",
      "Yes its a free game but I did bother spending on cosmetic things to try and make it more interesting but it didn't really change anything for me.\n",

      "It's a free game, a chill game, a Protia/Albion game, except instead of how Albion makes everyone farm to steal from everyone else, and kill each other, this game actually encourages you to work together.  If you farm a node near someone else, they can collect it when you are done, or you can farm it together and save on durability.  If someone is in your party and you both farm a node, or are in close proximity, you each have a chance to double the material you find.  So that's 4 times as much than if you were by yourself for just 2 people.  Party size of up to 4.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there is no health bar.  There is no fall damage, there is no drowning, no sleeping; for players.  The NPCs sleep but you can still interact with them by going to their homes, even when sleeping.  It's kind of a cool game.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know about the future of this game.  I know there has been a known issue with one of the quests, a pretty important issue for a much involved quest.  There are about 700 people who have put in requests for it to be repaired over the last 6 months, and it hasn't been closed.  People have said they are in transition, the company sold to someone else.  I don't know if that is true but it seems if it was sold then someone is probably planning to do something with it.\n",
      "\n",

      "This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's so well thought out it blows my mind. Whoever designed this game really knows what they're doing, and what a good game is. 999/10 I can't put this down <3 It's tons of fun - both from a content perspective, BUT also from the gameplay, its systems and all the QOL stuff. Also the writing is super fun, I love it! Fells like Minecraft met Animal Crossing met Sims, and had a baby that shares all the good pieces from each. Absolutely amazing game!\n",

      "I love the game. It IS a grindfest, but I enjoy this one. The NPC's are fun to interact with, the world feels immersive, and there really is always something you could do. If you want to build stuff, build stuff. If you want to catch bugs, go get em. You wan to sit and do nothing, do nothing. There's a lot to do, or not do. Your journey really is what you make of it.\n",

      "I have been playing since Open Beta started last August, longer than I have been playing on Steam. There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. \n",
      "1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.\n",
      "2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!\n",
      "3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.\n",
      "4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.\n",
      "5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.\n",
      "6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. \n",
      "7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. \n",
      "8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. \n",
      "9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. \n",
      "10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)\n",
      "11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.\n",
      "12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.\n",
      "13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! \n",
      "14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! \n",
      "15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. \n",
      "16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.\n",
      "17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!\n",
      "18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. \n",
      "19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.\n",
      "20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.\n",
      "21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!\n",

I'll keep an eye out for updates and might come back later when hopefully this issue will be fixed and the game will run better on PC.

      "Now, all of these are just off the top of my head.  Would I pay for Palia?  I'm not sure.  Right now, it feels like this is only a fraction of the world.

      "So far, I am absolutely loving this game.  To me it seems like a combination of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing but with interactions between players.  The graphics are really nice and the game play seems fairly intuitive. I haven't had any connection issues or anything like that, but I also don't have any friends that are playing this game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite not knowing anyone in the game, People seem to be willing to help out.  I love that everyone is so nice and accommodating. There is a quest were you have to fulfill another player's request, if there isn't any up, players are usually willing to put up some easy requests for you so that you can complete that quest. Furthermore, if you're missing a pretty common ingredient, for say cooking or furniture building, players are pretty good at filling those requests. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have gotten far enough in the game that I can now get some of the higher quality and rarer ingredients, and I love that players use the flares and call out in chat where those rarer ingredients are on the map.  It is so helpful and I love the way it makes you feel immersed into the game, like you really are apart of this community. \n",

      "I am so impressed that I have played over thirty hours of game play and haven't really felt the need to pay for anything, so far. Everything in the store seems to be mostly cosmetic, that being said, I still plan on getting something small, just because some of the cosmetic Items are cute, especially the pets. For those who don't want to spend anything, I still think that you can enjoy the game without paying anything, which is always awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have read complaints about how slow the progression is, I don't feel that the game is slow in progressing at all.  I think the pacing of the game is very well done, especially for a crafting/farming mmo, to me the slower progress seems intentional so that players don't feel like they have done everything that there is to do in just a week of playing.\n",

      "\n",
      "When I saw I only had 10 hours to show, I couldn't believe it. The crafting and gathering and running out of space and selling and rinse and repeat is somewhat tedious.\n",
      "To build your first house you need roughly 150 minutes worth of crafted materials - 150 items that needed to be gathered first. Now - to be fair - you leave it to craft - go offline or do some questing or some more grinding (Just remember the limited inventory) but then once you put the resources into the house - you still have to wait a long time for it to be built - which increases with every add on.\n",
      " \n",
      "The inventory is something that left me confused - though I found out later that this was user error, the beige, white and light yellow wallpapers gifted to me were the same colour as the inventory and appeared to be empty spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does lead me to my next point though which is honestly confusion - as a beginner at this game, you are guided through all the typical points of Game Play WASD, Space Bar, How to climb etc. All the slightly more complicated things like fishing are explained with the use of overly wordy graphics. But then you get to the game mechanics that are specific to the game - such as catching bugs - which again is explained by overly wordy graphics when you get the quest - with no easy way to retrieve the information again when you actually need it (Again - this could be attributed to user error.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The housing system is actually quite neat - and exactly why I was looking for this style of \"MMO.\" But Farming - is again extremely grindy - and you have to keep purchasing seeds with coins - that is until you upgrade enough to by the seed making machine. (I haven't bought it yet.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold - Illustrious gold. Another grind - took me a while to earn gold. Now - should currency be easy to get? Not necessarily. But I do think that it is perhaps a little unbalanced when you spend 200 + gold for a quest, only to receive like 50 in return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly of my negative review - is there a reason for multiplayer? Not in the least. I haven't seen the negativity in the chats that other people are mentioning. but that really feels like all you do as a collaborative effort - chat, ask for stuff and occasionally party up for the occasional difficult tree and mob... I was hoping for something perhaps a teensy bit more community driven - Think Hay Day style with selling things from your plot - boy did I get excited seeing that bin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all this to say that I have actually dedicated 10 hours to see if I liked it - I love the bug catching, super cute and cool you can populate your house enough to make entomophobes weep. The placement of furniture, as far as this style of game goes is very versatile. The storyline is not too bad - though it really feels unpopulated by NPCs who actually have important things to do - not that I was looking for another \"MMO\" that asks you to \"retrieve 20 of this\". But the story is really only centred around the scientist lady. Oh, and I love the loot chests - especially getting to keep the chests - even if they aren't functional. Oh yes - what is the point of the pantry for your veggies if all you can do is open and close the door?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to continue exploring a little more - I am playing alongside my siblings so perhaps I will discover some more along the way - though the party system is feeble at best.\n",

      "I absolutely love this game. I feel it hits almost every need that I've had out of any game like this. Hunting fishing, resource gathering, farming, decorating, etc. The fishing mechanics are nice, the furniture placement/customization is super neat. And over all, this game is just super enjoyable to play. There is a main story line and quests to do as well. And the npcs are unique and well done (and you can romance some of them).\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is a bit that the game is lacking in my opinion. I would like to see more quests and ones you can actually do with friends. More farming plots (you are only allowed 9 total plots that have 9 slots each to plant on). Something actually done with the community/guild system. The ability to share a house or housing plot with your friends or community. More cooking options and crops to grow. More animals to hunt. And the ability to have livestock type animals. Would also like to see rideable creatures. \n",

      "This is such a beautiful game and wonderful gameplay experience! Lots of people saying it’s like Stardew, which is half right, but also if you’re looking for even cosier game play than that then look no further - it’s Stardew without the stress of crops withering and trying to get to shops before they close, but with just as much satisfaction!!! Magical/thoughtful story to follow which doesn’t get dull. As an MMO it really works because this game can 100% be enjoyed solo (casually hopping around doing quests, cooking, farming, hunting etc) but you’ll be able to find people to play with. Having other solo players running around makes the gameplay feel less lonely so for me it’s the perfect balance! Zero toxicity thus far too. You won’t regret it!\n",
