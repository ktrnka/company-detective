That being said, I\\'m still having a lot of fun with Palia, especially when playing with friends. It\\'s a chill life simulator and I hope they keep it that way.\\n\\nWhat I like:\\n- No hostile mobs.\\n- Fishing/hunting/cooking mechanics.\\n- Party buffs.\\n- Animations.\\n- Storage system. No need to run to 8 different chests to find something.\\n- How \\'alive\\' the world is (not talking about multiplayer). We can randomly pick up a quest item and that feels more organic.\\n- House editing. The top-down view is very convenient and I like how we can customise our house layout. Wish the fireplace didn\\'t take up an entire wall though. Also hope we are able to stack rooms in the future since we have a 2nd floor with that bigger Harvest house.\\n- Art style.\\n\\nWhat I hope improves:\\n- Farming is quite slow, hope we get some upgrades that let us automate it a bit.\\n- Storage needs more filters, especially for our furniture.\\n- More interactions with villagers!\\n- More Community function. Maybe a community chest that we can all use to share items.\\n\\nIssues: (some might just be a \"my laptop\" issue)\\n- Lighting glitches out sometimes when the time of day changes.\\n- Animals glitch out when multiple appear out of a tree at the same time.\\n- I crash almost 80% of the time when I first boot up the game. After that it runs smoothly.\\n- Bugs (insects) sometimes clip under the floor. (not talking about them despawning)\\n- Desync issues (animals/players) especially when in a party.\\n- Hair colour bug. (primary and secondary swap places and primary doesn\\'t show up)\\n- World not loading in randomly. (ground to the mines disappears. when I enter a room, all the furniture goes into the void)\\n- Chat box flickering randomly.\\n- Texture bugs.

Turned out the house decorating system is great and I'm also dying to get to know the villagers' backstories (the emotional baggage will end me). The daily schedule of villagers gives the player the impression of a living village, with npcs having their duties and habits. There's also romance. <3 For those who get bored fast Palia has a bunch of minigames, including simple but fun temple puzzles, arcade, agility tests and a game of cards you play with other players. The community is friendly and very helpful. Overall 10/10 cozy game to relax after a long day of trying to earn for a house irl. \\r\\n\", steam_china_location='', steam_purchase=False, timestamp_created=1723676821, timestamp_updated=1723676821, voted_up=True, votes_funny=0, votes_up=1, weighted_vote_score='0.523809552192687988', written_during_early_access=False),\n",

I decided to get two outfits yesterday upon one i really liked being released and they put the outfit in game and set it at 1700 in game coins which is ... A lot for a person of below average income but i said oh well it will make me happy BECAUSE  the game makes me happy and so i bit the bullet... Only to feel like a complete  FOOL when not even a few hours later they cut the prices down on the two outfits i bought full price IN LITERAL HALF just after i bought them for double the price. without ZERO NOTICE or NEWS ALERT... Feeling literally scammed out of my money THAT i could have literally stretched and gotten more out of and quite frankly like i just got ripped off considering they gave ZERO news alerts about the outfits being reduced in price AND ETC... but hey i guess they were dirty like that and most likely did it on purpose... im sure theres more folks like me feeling absolutely blind-sighted by the price-drop they did shortly after releasing it at a high one....like its absolutely ridiculous.... Literally any player who would have known would have waited to get it for half the price the same day it was released OBVIOUSLY but noooo. They gave ZERO NOTICE nor NEWS ALERTS IN GAME about this pricedrop ...ONLY ABOUT IT BEING RELEASED.... money grabbed players upon its immediate release at 1700 ... oh and the other outfit i got they cut down from 1275 to 678 or something just for even more collateral damage to my feelings of the purchases i regret more then anything now. \\n\\nIt wouldnt have even bothered me if they atleast gave notice or immediatly released the outfits at the cutdown price. Its the principal of the matter and their antic  that literally TURNED ME STRAIGHT OFF from even wanting to play the game after feeling scammed like im sure others who did the same thing i did feel... the only thing that would make me feel better about it is if they corrected the wrong doing and made me feel whole which i have yet to hear back about after foling a ticket. Like that antic literally just costed them a consumer that was happy to support the game in the future with upcoming packs and etc.... Aint no way ill ever spend another penny on this game again just for the rug-pull of a move they did with the new outfit releast today. Nope. Thats hurtful to your customers. I dont get why they would even do that....\\n\\nsmh ... Disappointed is an understatement for what they did. I get its a free game but i cant believe this game doing this to the ones that DO support them ?\\n\\nThey literally ....\\n\\nReleased New out fit at double the price and then dropped it to half in not even a few hours.... YEAH I FEEL BAD FOR US PLAYERS WHO GOT PLAYED... good job????! like all u guys did was hurt the people who support you by doing that to not one but two of the outfits.... not nice.... Had it been made aware in game via the news alerts i wouldnt even be mad and take that L but yeah... LACK OF COMMUNICATION ON GAME STAFF BEHALF and just wanting to make people spend more to spend more and then doing that to them...
