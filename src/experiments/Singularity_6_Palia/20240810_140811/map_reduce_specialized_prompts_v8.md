# Negative Sentiments

## Gameplay and Design Issues
- "Palia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city." [generalmasandra on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn4d7g/)
- "The gameplay loop was so insanely boring, only two zones and max. 24 other Players with you on one map." [Labskaus77 on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn2w40/)
- "Palia was such a let down. The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it." [LostMinimum8404 on 2024-07-02](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbkb5g/)
- "The MMO features were so half baked that all I could think while playing was what a waste they didn't just focus on a polished single player game." [Kynaras on 2024-07-02](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbc60m5/)
- "Palia so boring, after 10-20h playing, its like other farm simulator, but the same Stardew Valley, being essentially a single-player game, is much more exciting and replayable than this 'MMO'" [Sand3rok on 2024-07-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbf72zi/)
- "The building sucks too. You just plop down prefab stuff." [MyStationIsAbandoned on 2024-07-02](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbcd04q/)

## Monetization Concerns
- "The problem I had with it is with a cozy game, cosmetic microtransactions are basically P2W because the whole experience is more cosmetic in nature." [Educational_Shoober on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kynpur9/)
- "The game should have been $20, single player, with a focus on the story since that's exactly how it plays." [MyStationIsAbandoned on 2024-04-08](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn75n0/)
- "Palia has shit monetization anyway with cosmetics being 99% locked behind the shop." [Puffelpuff on 2024-07-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbeo38c/)
- "Selling cosmetics... is actually incredibly toxic and frustrating in cozy games where cosmetic progression tends to be one of the core pursuits." [KegelsForYourHealth on 2024-05-18](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1cu1f7i/palia_studio_singularity_6_confirms_36_workers/l4jib8r/)

## Development and Company Concerns
- "Palia failed as a game and failed their objectives. This is the confirmation. A few years of maintenance mode milking and then shutdown is my prediction." [Ic3b3rgS on 2024-07-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbd8iv3/)
- "Palia was dying pretty steadily, all the devs getting fired, etc. so I can't imagine they paid more than a few million for the whole thing." [tsukaimeLoL on 2024-07-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dtp97n/daybreak_acquires_singularity_6_palia_developer/lbeipg7/)
- "The game is in a horrible state. There are missing features and content. It is not what it was advertised as." [ArrynMythey on 2023-08-16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/)
- "If nothing changes with the game's official release, this game will die a slow death." [ArrynMythey on 2023-08-16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Palia/comments/15sufww/repost_open_up_your_eyes/)
