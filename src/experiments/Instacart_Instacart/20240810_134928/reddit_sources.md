I would not feel very confident in a recipe that they couldn't bother to make once and have someone make it look nice and photograph it. (I know there's a lot of tricks to make food look good in photos like motor oil instead of syrup, but I think you get what I'm saying.)

These are hilariously horrifying though.

The second hotdog one hurts my brain. Are the condiments on the closer one on the hotdog or on the bun? Looks like it's on the hotdog but then the bun at the front is also shaped like a hotdog.

As GenX, I can tell you right now, some boomer or GenX named Carol had her grandson Hunter Midjourney this shit so she could impress her boss. The bitch still can't figure out Photoshop, but she's got a Canva account and ain't afraid to use it. Still, Canva can only do so much, so she hopes that her bifocal slingin', saggy Depends draggin', cardigan clutchin' friends won't notice this shit. And as long as Bev, that "millenial bitch" in customer relations, keeps diverting, ignoring and blocking complaints via X, FB and email, Carol will let Bev in on special rates for Doterra. Fuck you, Carol.

Technically not, I think, because recipes don’t have just one way of looking. It’s not like… say, a puzzle where the right answer is putting the pieces in the exact places - if it turns out not like the picture it’s false advertising. But if two different people cook the same dish, you don’t necessarily expect them both to look identical to the picture in the recipe book, right? Maybe I’m wrong - or maybe that’s a bad analogy - I agree it’s creepy to use AI but I don’t think it’s quite false advertising.

RIP to all the graphic designers and 3d modelers. People can say they arent worried all they want and say how they will still need real people but there is no company that isnt going to save money and time by using AI to do their heavy lifting. At best they will have one creative person to oversee the work being done by AI, but they have no need for much more than that.  


Graphic design and things like 3d modeling are already VERY competitive markets when looking for work. Especially right now, but it's only going to get worse in the coming months until it trickles down to nothing.  


Very depressing to a creative person who truly enjoys the work they do.

# Post ID utow9i: Instacart Membership Refund $99 with +17 score by [hisbonics on 2022-05-20](https://www.reddit.com/r/instacart/comments/utow9i/instacart_membership_refund_99/)
Somehow I was charged the $99 for a one-year Instacart subscription, and since it came out of my Venmo account, which I rarely use, I didn't notice it until the 14-day period that let's you cancel the subscription, without it being an issue, had passed. First I asked Venmo about it, they said to first ask my bank since they took it from my bank. I was about to request that my bank reverse the charge, but they said that they could do it if I said it was fraud, and I didn't feel comfortable with that. I decided to get on Instacart's customer support chat (Virtual Care Assistant) and see what their response would be. The virtual assistant didn't help at first, it gave me a phone number that opens to FaceTime and that wouldn't connect. I tried again with a new chat and then requested a contact phone where I could speak to a human and the virtual assistant asked if it could connect me through chat to a live customer service rep. I said yes and I was connected to a real living

I told the customer service rep my situation, biggest thing that the charge was above my means as I am barely able to pay the roof over my head (which I am thankful I have been able to do until now) and that getting that $99 back was critical for my situation. I told them to check the account and they could see that I wasn't using the service since that one initial order (which was an emergency situation for an event, where they needed some items post haste and I was the one who volunteered to place the order on my phone!).

The person asked me to wait for a moment, then in less than a minute they came back and said they had checked my account and that he had already sent a refund!

Maybe it was that I only used the service that one time for items that you could tell were for an event, and it was a small order. Maybe because I made a good case regarding my situation. Maybe God blessed me with the right rep. Maybe Instacart will consider your situation.

I hope anyone who needs a refund is able to get it!

Hope this helps you!

Just keeping this thread issue alive. No clue how we got on instacart+, noticed we had free delivery which made us check the profile and sure enough we were just billed 3 days ago. Canceled our order and called (and live chatted) their customer service only to be told that we couldn't be refunded since there was activity on the new membership...

The amount of times I had to explain that there were no actual orders only to be met with "but the system won't do a refund" broke my brain.

In the end, a quick call to the bank, the names of the worthless customer support members and a tight timeline helped get the charge disputed and reversed.

Hope this helps someone else out there, I'm convinced their + program is a scam.

Not sure if it's just a difference in banks, but I called my customer support and explained how they have a really sketchy opt-in prompt without much other warning that you've enrolled. Outside of that, I got lucky and took a screenshot of my customer support chat with instacart and their mentioning of disputing it with the bank. There was an additional form I ended up having to fill out with my bank after my initial call though.

If that doesn't work, you can try calling instacart customer service before 9pm eastern to get a hold of a manager that can reverse the charge- but that was going to be my last step option if needed.

I totally agree.  The scam is if you place an order, and sign up for Instacart at the same time, they will charge you a yearly ($104) fee, but will not tell you that they are charging this fee.  Then, when you discover the amount deducted from your checking account, and contact them the VERY NEXT DAY, and ask for a refund, or to switch to a monthly membership, you will be told that you cannot do that because you already placed an order!!  So, basically, you can NEVER get a refund if you place an order and sign up for Instacart at the same time.  In my opinion, this is seriously deceptive and a HUGE scam!!  I tried calling customer service but was told there was nothing they could do, and I was not eligible for either a refund or a change to a monthly plan.  I asked to speak to a supervisor but was also refused that request.  NEVER using Instacart again, and hopefully, this is a warning to others  - DO NOT sign up for this service!!!  Overpriced and terrible customer service.

I also have been tricked and deceived by the hidden language accompanied with my order at Publix. I'm living on a fixed income and the funds weren't even in my bank account, so when they hit my bank it paid the 100.00 and sent my account into red along with an isf fee of 35.00! Called customer service and was told since I completed my order for groceries by the way using my food stamps because I am barely able to eat right now, I was told sorry 😞 nothing we can do to help you.

I bet the app suggested the dumplings as a replacement. Sometimes, the suggested replacements aren’t even close to what you want- like you want a package of bagels and the suggested replacement is like “replace with: Apples”.

Right, the only time I get mad about a replacement is if they don't ask me if it's a really weird one. 

Weird stuff you didn't order just comes with using the app, I only ask for refunds if it's stuff I absolutely didn't want (and can't use). Only two outright "wtf?" experiences I had were someone grabbing a replacement I explicitly said I didn't want and one time someone grabbed me fuckin' GRAVY as a vanilla extract replacement??? lmao

You're seeing the 0.1% of good/bad deliveries.  Because for it to pop up on your feed, it means that 1)Something went horribly wrong or incredibly good and 2)That "fringe scenario" is on Reddit 3)They chose to post it.

It's mostly just grabbing groceries, checking out, and driving the order to the customer, with a little bit of "they're out of russet potatoes, are you okay with Idaho Potatoes instead?"

Tbf, I’ve used instacart a number of times and have not spent a bunch of time arguing. In fact, I’m admittedly a slow shopper that gets distracted and the IC shopper is usually much faster than me. I may get one or two texts asking about a substitution and that’s about it. I’ve gotten a bad shopper only once or twice and rarely had anything wrong. 

People don’t generally post the shops that went hunky dory because that would frankly be boring. So I think the sub makes it look worse than it is. That said, with the slashes they’re making to shopper pay, I do wonder if the days of decent IC are numbered…

Can confirm about the shoppers being fast. My mom used to do instacart and shipt and I went along with her once because I wanted some groceries. That woman practically SPRINTS through the store to try and meet the unrealistic expectations on her end of the app. She was a shopper you’d want every single time if you could. Super polite, always looking for the best produce, I mean you can tell she loves to shop. But that line of work ended up not being wort it in the end, due to the wear and tear on her car. Plus she’d get super stressed when some jerk would give a terrible review because the item they wanted wasn’t in stock, because it would TANK her 5 star rating for reasons out of her control.

Your response about the ‘seafood department’ was clearly pretty confusing to him since you *actually* meant ‘the seafood counter’.

I interpreted "I do this for a living" less as "I'm the grocery expert so shut up and tip me" and more "i have other orders and can't spend 10 minutes standing in the seafood aisle texting you about crab cakes", especially because the customer was giving vague and incorrect instructions on an off-menu item request

I also think he is ESL. And the customer actually ordered the packaged lobster cakes but “always requests they substitute for the fresh ones” since they don’t let you order the fresh crab cakes through the app.

This is where I stand. I consider myself to be a somewhat competent shopper who still enjoys Supermarket Sweep episodes. If a friend asked me to go to the "seafood department" for crab cakes, I'd be like "...where else would I go?"

It's actually more complicated than that.  OP didn't want the crab cakes they ordered from the start.  They wanted special in-house ones that aren't available through the delivery service through the app, so they put in the boxed ones in as a dummy order, then apparently texted after they started shopping to tell the shopper that they didn't want the thing they ordered and wanted them to get different ones from "behind the counter".  I can easily see where the shopper would be confused by the strange request without proper explanation.

Edit: Just for clarification, OP said this stuff in other comments.  They apparently regularly do this ol' switcheroo to get stuff that isn't available through the app.

EXACTLY The impression I got also.  I thought the Customer was playing dumb but that they had a plan all along to get stuff that was not available through the app for a reason… Like special order stuff from behind the counter. So they played dumb in order to make it sound like the shoppers fault. That's why that guy was getting frustrated with the interaction. Although honestly, that's pretty ballsy to pull something like that and still post it up on Reddit for other people to interpret.

At first it was a miscommunication, sure.

While refusing to move on and refund and instead argue as to if the store has the crab cakes the customer wanted. 

I get there's tips and reviews involved so the shopper has a right to defend themselves, but they turned on the cunty first.

This could have all been avoided if you had said “behind the counter” initially. Even I was confused until you said that. Some people, including me need you to be specific & not expect others to know what you mean when you give a generalized term such as “seafood department”. 

Then you berated him saying you said behind the counter 5 times when you said it only once before he confirmed he did checked already.

It's incredibly infuriating when you don't understand something and the person demanding you understand just repeats the same sentence again and again as if somehow you'll divine further information from it.  It's particularly silly in text when the full previous sentences are all clearly visible.  OP could have easily explained better/further, but didn't want to for whatever reason.

When I was reading this, my first thought was just the seafood department lol which is where all the frozen/refrigerated seafood is. The customer was not being clear when they said department—which is a whole section—instead of behind the counter.

I clocked this too. The guy clearly didn't understand what OP meant the first time around, and OP just repeated himself and got indignant about it. 

I don't know if I'm just good at noticing when people aren't understanding me, but at the same time I feel like it's not that hard, and it's extremely easy to avoid escalating these situations with stupid comments like "I said that five times" like no you didn't. You said "seafood department". And then to avoid having to be wrong about something, he acted like he specifically referred to the counter the entire time, because this is Reddit, and most people who use this dogshit website have a terrible phobia about being wrong about anything ever.

I sometimes wonder if our failing education system is leaking through in times like this. OP didn’t seem to grasp how a person may be confused by what they said and part of it is because they used some shit grammar.

Honestly, the poor punctuation is what makes this so confusing/obtuse to me.

This is the one that made me do a triple take: "I said if you can get the crabcakes from the seafood department, I want those if you can't get the crabcakes from the seafood department then refund."

Easily could be interpreted as OP saying "I want the ones you sent me a picture of if you can't get the ones from the seafood department."

Had OP said, "I said if you can get the crabcakes from the seafood department, behind the counter, those are what I would prefer. If you can't get the ones from behind the counter in the seafood department, then please refund."

It's silly to assume everyone can transcribe a text like this with complete accuracy.

Yeah they were both in the wrong. I didn’t realize OP meant specifically behind the counter until they specifically said that (at which point they claimed to have said that multiple times). Seafood department could just be the aisles where they keep the seafood.

At the same time though, dude did seem defensive from the get go. Although, he could have been a bigger dick and just gone ahead with the crab cakes in the photo and played it off as a mix up. Actually, OP is lucky he took the time to clarify and he didn’t legitimately mix things up because of this confusing conversation.

Soon as I got “this is ridiculous” I would be done.

The shopper literally sent you a photo and said “replace with these?” And you said yes. Then you made it super confusing with repeating “if they don’t have A replace with B.” He tried to verify but you kept repeating the same confusing answer, totally disrespecting the time he is spending at the store trying to decipher your vague responses. Your vague responses AFTER agreeing to whatever type of crab cake was in the photo. I feel bad for the shopper here.

A lot of grocery stores have a frozen section in the seafood department so both of you could have done better communicating. At the beginning you said seafood department, not behind the counter. He could have picked that up from the seafood department in the frozen section or from the frozen aisles in the seafood section. You didn’t state “behind the counter” until the end. 

I hate when customers say they want the “fresh” shrimp or fish and won’t take the frozen as a replacement or are appalled that I would ask that. They obviously don’t realize those “fresh” shrimp were just pulled from the freezer and the seafood guy ran water over them for 5 minutes so they would be “fresh”, dumped them in the tray at the counter and added $4 to each pound. Hardly anything you get from a grocery store is actually fresh and not previously frozen.

There was obviously a miscommunication here. The customer should have stated behind the counter from the start. Shopper was just trying to offer a replacement and was probably just as confused. They then got a little angry because the customer said that last bit like they've been stating behind the counter the whole time when clearly they didn't.

 Seafood department is typically a whole section of the store split into sub sections. You have to specify. People can't read minds lol

Yeah it seems like English isn't the shopper's first language. He's probably trying to say, "Does that make sense?" But, "understand," is much ruder and it's hard to explain why.

Shopper is a bit of an ass but your replies and poor communication did not help the case. When talking to people you don’t know, you’ve got to be as thorough as possible (assume they are an idiot until they prove themselves otherwise). You failed to inform the shopper in a singular message that under no circumstances that you want to buy the frozen cakes in the picture. This was the catalyst for confusion which was then exacerbated by the shopper thinking that the section of frozen foods that contains seafood is “the seafood department”.

Customer didn’t say from BEHIND the seafood counter at first. Dockside classics are merchandised in, and ring up as seafood department. I worked in seafood departments for 20 years. Shopper was smart enough to already check for the fresh cakes behind the counter, it seems that they would have offered them as well if they were available. Also, let’s not forget the fact that the customer originally ordered dockside LOBSTER cakes, and the first logical replacement would be something similar of the same brand. Understand, this guy does this for a living. 😂

So many people said the shopper is at fault but I think OP is at fault more than the shopper. Learn to communicate better as many people have pointed out that seafood department doesn’t mean behind the counter.

I'm going to be odd man out here and say that what you said was really confusing. You meant fresh seafood department. There is a seafood area in frozen as well. So, just saying "seafood department" over and over wasn't helping clear confusion. I didn't even get it until the last photo and then realized you meant you wanted them from fresh seafood and not frozen. You did come off a bit rude. I didn't read rudeness from the shopper, just confusion and trying to make sure you got exactly what you wanted. But, everyone perceives things differently. That's just my take.

Edit: Someone said these are actually fresh and not frozen, in the seafood department and just not behind the counter. That makes this conversation even more confusing. It just appears to be a miscommunication on both ends.

This has nothing to do with a language barrier. The "seafood department" does not mean "behind the counter". It just doesn't. 

One could infer that's what it means... but it's definitely not the normal way to say that. 

If someone said "I want a cake from the bakery section"... that wouldn't mean behind the counter to me. That'd mean a cake in the bakery section, I.e. a packaged cake. 

OP was able to repeat themselves about "seafood department" over and over when it was obvious the shopper didn't know what they meant. Why didn't OP *lead* with "behind the counter"? Especially since they say they do this on every order with the crab cakes.

I can’t be completely sure, just speculating… and while I get your point, I’m not sure it applies here because in grocery stores there are 2 places that sell seafood; behind the counter where you have to ask somebody, and also out on the floor in a fridge/freezer section. I’m only stating maybe the shopper maybe thought the fridge freezer section was what the customer meant when they said seafood dept, but the customer actually meant behind the counter

The shopper seems to misunderstand only what “seafood department” means. If there is no place in the store called “seafood department,” then it’s an innocent mistake. People are always talking about “just pick it up from the chicken section” and it’s like… is that what you call the aisle where the chicken is, or is there a sign in the store called “chicken section” that I should be looking for?

Once OP said “behind the counter,” the shopper understood immediately and OP acted like “behind the counter” was what he said the whole time.

Those crab cakes are in the seafood department though. Typically right below the displays of fresh fish on ice you order from the counter. I think that’s where the confusion stemmed from.

Right!  The customer should have said “fresh crab cakes from behind the counter” to begin with,  but they didn’t until the end.  Instead they said “crab cakes in the seafood department”, well, those boxed cakes are in fact in the seafood department!

Honestly, I'd be annoyed here too. The shopper is clearly not getting what OP is trying to communicate. And instead of them just saying "behind the counter", they just keep repeating "seafood department" over and over in a condescending as fuck way.

There was definitely miscommunication and both got frustrated way too fast. I think writing "Seafood Department Counter" instead "Seafood Department" would have been a lot more clear for the shopper. The point where OP says shopper needs to ask the person at the counter, the shopper is already annoyed and I'm almost 100% sure he did NOT ask the man working the seafood counter. After they both exchanged some heated words I'm not surprised the shopper cancelled because he probably thought he was getting his tip reduced.

Honestly as someone that works at the grocery store I had no idea what you were talking about and totally agree with the shopper. You ordered lobster cakes, store didn't have, they offered crab cakes, you said yes seafood department crab cakes. You said from the seafood department which is the whole area, not the special made behind the counter ones. Then when you added that part you barely gave them time to breathe before calling them rude and dumb. I think they lost the professionalism a lil at the end but not enough to matter

Your fault.  You were not clear in your communication by saying “the ones from the seafood department.”  He asked if you wanted what was in the picture, and he found them in the seafood department, hence the confusion.  You should have just said “no, I don’t want the ones in the picture.”

He was definitely giving attitude. I think he started off with good intentions, but his communication was really unclear. He was probably a little mad, too, because on percentage based tips, we get paid less when we have to refund. So if he was worried about that, that’s probably why he cancelled. Still, he crossed a line by escalating and it’s shitty that he cancelled on you.

If you’re the customer I think you’re in the wrong here. He was clear that they did not have the ones behind the counter and showed you what they had instead. He asked if you wanted to replace your selection with the one he showed. You said yes but then said refund if they didn’t have the ones he already told you were sold out. I think he was pretty clear communicating and you were not understanding. Your responses were very confusing and I can see why he got frustrated.

As someone who worked in a grocery store for my first job, and did instacart at some point, I can answer this objectively without getting caught up in the emotional aspects of the response.

Your responses were incorrectly stated from the beginning. He was absolutely correct that is the seafood department and he told you the seafood department only has that one option. You failed to communicate what you wanted and then you gaslit him in the argument and acted like you had been stating something far more specific than you did from the beginning.

The conversation WAS ridiculous. He didn't need to state it, but what else do you do when you really on getting the information you need and they just won't say it?

As someone who door dashes grocery runs I get where both are upset, however at the first sign of confusion I'll usually call the customer and explain first hand what they do or don't have and get from them they want a refund. Also we have an option that if something was scanned into the cart such as a substitute as long as I've not checked out I can issue refunds on the item. The shopper is a little rude as Ive never talked to customers that way but again as mentioned he may be ESL. Either way, when in doubt the phone calls never hurt. That is, if the customers answer

Some places have a meat section but also have an actual butchery. Some places have a deli counter and also have fridges with deli meats.

Same with seafood. Some have “fresh” seafood behind a counter and also have a section of seafood offerings in specific fridges. 

If OP wanted to be clear, they should have not used seafood department interchangeably with seafood counter. You want the fresh stuff behind the counter, use your words and be consistent. Nobody’s reading your mind or trying to assume things.

OP was wrong here.

Dang...I had to go and track this crab cake/seafood dept/counter down to see what the news is about 😳

So, after reading the screenshot I only had to read the first few messages to see the customer was wrong. The shopper did get snippy which wasn't cool. All he had to say was unfortunately they don't have any single crab cakes would you like the ones in the pic shown? All that do you understand...? The customer isn't a child. That being said the shopper DID tell you that the ones in the picture was all that was it. But honey you came back AGAIN saying single crab cakes. Doesn't matter if it's meat department or counter....THERE WERE NO SINGLE CAKES. Honestly had you argued more after that I wouldn't refunded. If you gave me more issues I'd have dropped you. I shopped a whole order and a customer got mad because she wanted me to take individual pics at the cheese counter of a billion different cheeses. When I went to call her she told me she didn't care what I was doing send her the pics. I politely told her I would be dropping her order and as she was saying no wait I was hanging up on her. I don't know how your shopper was but at the end of the day if you have someone working with you to help you get your meal on the table just work with them! There is no need to be nasty to your shopper. Same thing for shoppers. If you have a decent customer just do your job. You don't have to kiss ass...and stop allowing customers to degrade you! The way I feel if I drop you I may get a cancellation but you won't be able to rate me 🤷🏽‍♀️

Then the shopper says again, hey, they don’t have the thing you want that’s what I was trying to tell you they only have this other thing then the customer says no go ahead and get the thing I want. 🤣

Seafood counter is a HUGE distinction from the seafood department. They are different. You were being confusing. This was annoying to read and I would have been annoyed shopping for you.

[OP added:](https://www.reddit.com/r/instacart/s/y24ZnOqKmy)

> Yeaah they don’t offer behind the counter crab cakes on the app so I always do those one and right when I get the shopper I tell them I’d like to substitute for behind the counter crab cakes. I’ve never once had an issue.

Shopper went to the prepackaged section of the seafood department and they were out of the lobster cakes. He sent a photo of the available crab cakes from the same brand from the same section of the store. OP said “yeah the crab cakes from the seafood department.” Honestly it was above and beyond to even ask for further clarification. I could never be a shopper because I would’ve just made the substitution and carried on. You said yeah to crab cakes. And then you’d be complaining about me here. 

Stop trying to order items that the app doesn’t offer and you’ll have fewer issues.

1) it's pretty clear he wasn't able to assume you meant behind the counter when you just kept repeating "seafood department". The seafood department is the entire department, which includes the displays and freezers/fridges around it, so he wasn't wrong at all.

2) when customers request refunds for items rather than accepting something similar or from a different brand, the shoppers pay is effected as well as statistics. So if a shopper tries to provide a substitute, that's why. The app also prompts you with an entire screen for replacing rather than refunding. It's not fair for the customer or the shopper.

The shopper should've picked up that you weren't saying what you meant, we deal with things like this all the time, but they may have been a new shopper. 

You also should be specific in your requests. Otherwise, you can't really blame anyone for not knowing what you mean.

OP, instead of saying “seafood department” you should had said “the seafood behind the seafood counter (the fishmonger counter)” because the seafood department could also mean the shelves where the seafood is kept. You weren’t clear and the guy was only offering a replacement because you weren’t being clear enough, and his use of “understand?” Was just a translation issue. You’re not very clever OP.

This makes a lot more sense now.. I saw this when it was first posted, before it went viral. I just saw the hilarious shitpost of the lobster mac, crabcakes, and lobster crabcakes. It was there that someone said that OP said they order the Dockside Classics lobster cakes because there is no option to order the fresh single crabcakes from behind the counter. I guess their store doesn’t carry the lobster 4 pack and knows it will require replacement? The texts on OP’s side made absolutely NO sense to me until that comment and they certainly would not have to someone on a time crunch to shop an order.

He was being a bit rude/condescending, but also you absolutely weren't being as clear as you think you were.

To be fair, you literally wrote the same thing word for word every time and he wasn’t getting it. If you want to ensure someone understands exactly what you’re saying you need to alter what information you’re providing. 

The second time it should’ve been like, “I do not want what is in the photo, but if they have crab cakes at the fish counter, please replace with those.” Sometimes people do need very explicit and exact instructions and not being yelled at with the exact same phrase that they clearly aren’t understanding again and again. Nothing is won by doing that.

Honestly if the frozen ones were in the seafood department (very likely) then OP would be at “fault”. Shopper was getting crab cakes from the seafood department like the customer was stating. If OP had started with “behind the counter” then it all would have been avoided. Why the cancellation once it was all figured out, no idea but they were probably annoyed and decided it wasn’t worth potentially being tagged as incorrect or incomplete.

I don’t think English is this shoppers first language and when you said yes, they probably thought you meant that you wanted what they showed you and it confused them. You also didn’t need to be rude and say “I said that like five times”, they instantly apologized after that and probably thought you would be more rude and decided to cancel.

Why is everyone saying the shopper was wrong?

They very clearly asked “do you want the crabcakes in the picture or do you want me to refund the item?”

And OP replied with ****“YES” **** and “from the seafood department” but literally all that seafood is in the “seafood department”

The shopper should have just left it at, " They're from the seafood department." And left it at that. Once OP expanded into the item being from behind the counter, the ordeal becomes skewed. I believe the shopper was going through lengths to accommodate OP, but in reality, the shoppers' time is expendable. I find OP to be rude and in the wrong.

I think the issue arrises in how long it took you to send your 3rd message (in the picture) after your 2nd message. 

In the screenshot he sent back it wasn’t there so I’m assuming there was enough time that he went forward with the items you had mentioned. 

The instructions, while *NOT* completely unclear, there is still some room for interpretation. The box that he chose as a replacement could be interpreted as being the crab cakes from the seafood department. The driver was in the seafood department. 

Later you clarified the ones that were behind the counter that the employee would have had to retrieve but not at that point. 

All this allowed for some misunderstanding to occur. 
Honestly I feel the only thing that could be perceived as “rude” from him initially was his use of the word understand twice but I just take that as he’s ran into some problems with other customers so he’s possibly over explaining a bit more and just communicating with you. 

Big picture, no I don’t feel you’re in the wrong but I also feel he wasn’t. Just a crappy situation with some miscommunication that led to some attitude. 

Only thing against him is, because he’s in a professional setting, it’s his responsibility to keep his calm

I feel like the whole convo it was pretty clear the shopper needed to just refund. As a customer when instacart has coupons, I feel sometimes shoppers fight too hard to replace items. I have had struggle conversations like this when I go through and put specific replacements or refund for each item.

Shoppers also pick the worst replacements sometimes its hilarious 😂

They don’t have the crab cakes you want, Immediately sends pic of potential replacement. Then says they already asked the people behind the counter about crab cakes already, that’s why they sent the picture of the frozen replacement. 

But how did they check behind the counter without knowing the customer wanted them to?  

They don’t have your product.
*replacement pic*
Do you want something else?

Yes, SINGLES from the seafood department. 

They don’t have anything except what I sent you (from the freezer section). 

The seafood department, seafood department, seafood department, seafood department! *begging to be understood but incapable of understanding how to be more clear 

Fuck you. *cancels order. 


Maybe next time specify freezers vs behind the counter ?  

The shoppers lack of customer service kill’s me. Like, sorry, I don’t quite understand what I’m missing, but I want to get you the right products if possible. They have this item here, but I don’t see any others.. would it be in a different area maybe?

I think you were excessive for a misunderstanding. You also weren’t that clear with “in the seafood department” you should have said behind the counter in the department from the get go. 

I think you were vague and you expected him to understand what you wanted without explaining it in a clear way.

He was not clear, and you had an attitude from "do you understand? I do this for a living" to "now you want a refund?" And "I'm trying to offer you choices, I won't again. This is ridiculous." In the customer service game, unless they are literally calling you names/cussing you out, you don't drop your gray wall facade. You keep neutral, you don't offer aside  comments like "I do this for a living".

 I worked in various customer service roles, in Person and on the phone for 16 years, he was just confusing until he got frustrated,  but you were snippy first.

You, crab cakes from the seafood department does NOT mean crab cakes from behind the seafood counter.

The driver took the conversation personally and borderline became on the offense. This is poor business skill and wouldn’t work in a more professional environment. 

The customer kept saying in the seafood department which was the incorrect way of describing what he/she wanted. The correct terminology would be “fresh” unfrozen crab cakes from the seafood counter. The customer also lost their cool.

Both are wrong. In this particular setting you have to anticipate at times the other party will be wrong or have limited understanding / knowledge / or education to get their point across. So it’s always good to be polite and ask specific questions not broad questions, and give specific not broad answers.

You were being a jackass and not communicating clearly at all. You said seafood department over and over, but the seafood department includes the freezers and bunkers with the frozen packaged seafood. Then at the end you clarified "seafood counter" which is a totally different thing, and then said "like I told you 5 times" which made you look like a total cunt. All you had to say is "fresh ones from seafood counter or refund" and it would have been fine but you're too damn stupid to get your point across.

He wasn’t the nicest but your comments were definitely confusing. When we he sends a picture of the replacement you say “Yes replace…”. The correct comment would have been “ No please don't get those. I'd like a single crab cakes from the seafood COUNTER, if not I'll take a refund.” Your comments were all
over the place and because you were not using the right language and instead using dept. I could see why he was like well yeah they are from where all the seafood is. This ones on you mate.

I think this is on OP, honestly. Shopper says they don’t have what you ordered so here’s a suggested replacement. And OP said, yes replace with crab cakes from seafood dept. which could be any section of the store where seafood is found. Including the freezer section. 

If you were trying to be super clear, you should have specified you didn’t want FROZEN crab cakes (and good on you b/c that shit is vile), that you only wanted FRESH from the seafood/meat counter. Which you did say. 

But the confusing part is where you said, “yes replace with…” And then you asked for a refund. I was confused too. 

This is a case of one party using not entirely clear language (and not calling things the same names, i.e., “seafood department” and the other person maybe not having English his first language and here we are. 

I hope you got the refund but if not, you could return the crab cakes yourself.

It sounds like you both have a lack of brain cells?

Basically he was offering to replace it with something else because what you wanted was not in stock and as far as I understand they already even checked for the same item behind the seafood counter as you instructed.

I don't necessarily see anyone being in the wrong here more just kind of like a breakdown of communication. Probably English is this dude's second language

You were pretty unclear. Seafood department ≠ seafood counter. As someone who DoorDash’s occasionally, it’s actually not always easy to understand what people mean (e.g. home delivery instructions), and English is my first language which may not be the case here. 

And let’s be clear, it’s not that hard to request a refund after the fact. I know it’s not ideal when money is tight, but considering you were shopping for lobster/crab, I doubt that’s the case. Be kind to your shopper, if you receive the wrong item, keep it, and get a refund. Seems like a win to me. Never a need to be any type of rude or condescending to someone who’s doing a job that is inherently disparaged.

you didn’t say “please” once, and get angry at a guy who’s clearly making an invested effort to get you the right products. he’s actually caring and you bark orders at him like it’s chatgpt and not a real human you’re speaking with. 

as far as the crab cakes go, it’s just an issue of misunderstanding, no one’s in the wrong. 

but i can tell you are shitty

edit: accusing someone of being rude for grabbing crab cakes from the seafood department (which is larger than just behind the counter) because that’s what you said the first 4 times and not “counter” is probably what made them mad at you. that’s actually absurd, no social awareness.

The grocery shopper!🤦🏻‍♀️ I believe your directions are extremely clear especially since I work in a seafood department. But that being said you should of replaced the word department with counter. As it definitely could’ve been worded better. Would like to mention the actual list probably says fresh crab cakes or made in store I feel like it’s not hard to understand. Especially since you said single crab cakes. I definitely think the shopper overreacted and missed the obvious fine print. I’ve also learned a majority of shoppers are clueless about everything and don’t shop at the stores they go to.

You want a stranger to locate and purchase a specific item out of tens of thousands of items in a grocery store:  then its up to you to be extremely precise in describing what you want and possibly where to find it.    


Based on on your messages, you did not grasp this responsibility.  


I would perhaps be a little flippant as well if a customer kept repeating the same vague description multiple times when its clear it wasn't enough to locate the item.  


I know its easy to feel entitled as the customer, but take some responsibility to assist this guy who's doing his best with the info provided.  I highly doubt the majority of these gig workers intentionally want to disappoint and get a bad review/rating.

"Seafood department" is too vague because there's frozen seafood near the counter but you wanted it from specifically behind the counter. The shopper didn't handle it well when he got frustrated but when you repeat the same instruction the same way, and they still don't understand, you should try rewording it for them to understand.

You’re in the wrong. Repeating the same misunderstood thing over and over again doesn’t make people understand it. You can’t get mad at someone not understanding what you mean when you don’t change what you’re saying. He’s obviously trying and even took initiative to find you an alternative and you just got pressed for running with the assumption that everyone knows what you’re thinking when you say things that aren’t explicitly said thoughts. He had every right to think the whole exchange was ridiculous, especially after it took you getting made to explain you ordered something that won’t show up the way it will for him.

You need to learn to communicate better.

If you want something specific you need to be *specific* about it.  You kept saying what you wanted in an extremely vague and weird manner, and then got upset at the guy for not understanding.

Rather than simply repeating yourself over an over, you should have provided more information.  It wasn't until the the end did you say behind the counter, when your whole thing could have been avoided if you started with that from the very beginning.

People can't read minds.  You should always cater to the lowest common denominator.

You didn’t say “behind the counter” 5 times, you said it once and were already annoyed by that point. The “department” versus the “counter” is very different and you didn’t communicate clearly 🤷‍♀️. The shopper found crab cakes in the seafood department and sent them to you, but that’s not what you wanted, even though it’s literally what you asked for… their tone wasn’t the best, but it’s a typed out message, they weren’t necessarily being rude, it just lacks the intonation from speech. Basically you phrased it horribly, and the shopper was right to be confused because you kept telling him that you wanted ones from the department (which he found) but also wanted a refund. If you aren’t clear, you can’t be annoyed 🤷‍♀️

This exchange was annoying. You completely ignored the photo and were vague. He was looking for a “yes that option is fine” or “no thank you just refund that item”, but instead you ignored the photo and rambled on making it confusing. 

I use Instacart on rare occasions for groceries when I know I'm going to be unable to make it to the store on time. I have never had any issues.  I just simply give a yes or no to replacement options so they can move on and complete the order easily. 

I have also dealt with many instacart shoppers at both of my jobs. I have noticed that when someone orders something and makes it complex the shoppers usually try to work it out for them based on what we have or what we can do without having special orders placed in advance.

Shopper is in the wrong. But obviously proper punctuation and adjective clarification would’ve helped when OP was texting. Regardless people have such low critical thinking skills in general. I understood exactly what OP was saying. If your profession is shopping I would assume you would understand seafood department as being the fresh made section “behind the counter”.

I thought you were a bit of an ass. You didn't say "the crab cakes from behind the counter at the seafood dept" so I can see how the shopper could check with you, since these apparently came from the seafood dept as well, they just aren't rlthe fresh ones (which you didn't specifically ask for until the end, where you got snappy".

I think people need to be reaaaal flexible when it comes to services like Instacart.  Communication via text can be inherently ambiguous and it’s so easy to lose empathy when you’re not face to face with the human on the other side of the wire.  You’re just gonna have to accept that sometimes your order won’t be perfect.  I think getting the wrong crab cakes is a small price to pay to avoid ruining someone’s day.  Service industry sucks, I did it for years waiting tables and making coffee.

I don’t know you but it seems a little ridiculous to send someone to get something specific that is not in a packaging. That’s the type of thing you need to go get yourself and if you are not capable of doing so I apologize. But if that’s the case you should call the store arrange the pick up with the department. I feel like you should have said “No thank you I regret to say I will request a refund for this.” And then give them a $5 tip for trying. You were both rude frankly.

After reading a couple times I feel like OP was super unclear, seafood department and behind the counter don’t mean the same thing and it was a bit untruthful in that last paragraph cuz that’s not what you originally said.

Instacart is kinda lame. On the thing you can mark “do not offer substitutions, refund if they do not have my item” 

And 99% of the time the people are texting me photos of substitutions. Like why do they offer to check that box if the shoppers are just gonna bother you anyway? 

I’ve had to use it for the last 3 months because my car is at the body shop due to a tree falling on it…. It’s not great! I’ve had almost the same conversation with the shoppers.

It's you lol. Clearly they, understandably, didn't know what you meant by "seafood department" and thought the one's they grabbed were that. so when you said "I said grab the ones from behind the counter like 5 times" that was not true at all. You never mentioned a counter until that point. Also at the point where you called them rude, they had already apologized and you had been way, way more rude than they ever were. Not to mention you're complete lack of politeness / friendliness to someone providing you a service throughout the entire thing. No 'hello's, 'please's, 'thank you's, or acknowledgment of their apology. YTA. it's you.

edit: And apparently you left out some very important context; the ones you wanted aren't even available in the app and you were trying to make a special request?? wow lol.

I think your shopper meant well.

They did not see "lobster cakes" but saw "crab cakes" from the same brand and suggested those. They *ARE* prepackaged and probably frozen, but they are *ALSO* "from the seafood department". You never once clarified that you meant "fresh" or "seafood counter" you just kept repeating words that he clearly was not comprehending the way you intended. 

I do not think he was "wrong" as you really were not clear. When they did not see the prepackaged "lobster cakes" they asked the person in the seafood department if they had more of the *LOBSTER cakes* in back and they didn't. 

I think you could have avoided frustration on your part and that of your shopper by asking if they could go to the *fresh seafood counter* and ask the person there to assist.

They got tired of doing their job. It probably wasn’t even you. I’m sure they want to do their best and give you all options if something is out of stock. If I went shopping for someone and order is out of stock I would feel like I must find a replacement or I failed. 

This happened to me last week when picking up a beer order while door dashing. Store out of stock, I had to notify door dash, try to contact customer for a substitute, could not contact customer. Next I had to call door dash, they asked a few questions, finally customer called me back. 20 minutes later now! I had to go find a substitute, the store had 2 -6 packs of the beer but the customer wanted a 12 pack. I felt like I had to pressure the store to give me the 2 -6 packs. Not sure why that was a problem because it was at a mom and pop store, they made up their own 6 packs with white cardboard boxes 🤷‍♀️

Basically I lost 20 minutes of my time and I really could have skipped out on the $6-7. I did not drop the order because I enjoy fulfilling the order and completing my task.

Okay but "seafood department" definitely isn't clear enough. English might not be their first language or they might not have the same connotation for what that means. And then to say "I told you to get it from behind the counter." ... no you didn't. If you don't know the connotation for that, it literally just means "the area of the store that has seafood." It's important to make sure you're clear, especially in a communication situation like this one where you've never communicated with that person before.

Unfortunately I did call IC and gave bad review and canceled tip which I told him. It was medium order and I told him I can’t walk out door and have fallen several times. I told him will cancel tip
He said ok. So I did. But otherwise very nice ppl. Sometimes I realize ordered so much gave driver my BOGO ( it’s just me so not going to eat the buy one get one free so give away). Plus gave guy other products like TP snd paper towels . Guy so appreciative

Wait, we’re being called “Delivery Drivers” and not “Shoppers”? That’s the real wtf. No wonder we’re being tipped like Domjnos pizza delivery even on a 100 item order after fighting for parking, spending an hour shopping, standing in long lines, loading to car, driving and then finally delivering to an apartment in the back on the 3rd floor with no elevator. 

Even though you used the wrong word ‘department’ right off the bat, as a seasoned Shopper with that rare thing called common sense I understood what you meant in your first reply. I would’ve then checked to see if your poorly described replacement was available and if not I would’ve refunded you. The Shopper has shit communication skills and made the whole thing way more confusing and drawn out then it needed to be, but you continuing to respond the same way when the Shopper clearly wasn’t getting it was pointless.

It’s probably just a difference in regions and grocery store setup but here in Florida we have a frozen seafood section and legit seafood departments just like the meat department.

I understood what the orderer was talking about and read the shopper as being snippy. In re-reading now days later, I can see how the shopper may have meant something different. 

Communication breakdowns are the pits.

This thread is interesting and showcases how wrong the upvotes on reddit can be. The most upvoted comment on this thread is in favor of the buyer, even though the buyer was not clear about the crabcakes being from behind the counter until the very last image, and then claimed to have said it 5 times. They weren't clear from the start, which was obviously frustrating to the shopper. Both parties could have handled it better to be completely fair if you ask me.

Idt OP was confused. OP said seafood department and shopper didn’t know what that meant. Are shoppers just not familiar with going up to the counter to get fresh food? I was genuinely surprised the shopper didn’t understand what OP meant. And then the shopper forced OP to get something she said she didn’t want. She wanted the singles from the seafood department, and those are clearly not singles.

In my grocery store the main frozen section is separate from the rest of the frozen seafood/all the seafood is kept in the same area. Initially found your messages confusing because he was offering you those crab cakes from the "seafood section" like you asked and you weren't verifying that you were okay with that replacement. To him it was a yes or no question. After reading that you meant specifically from the seafood counter/fresh seafood, I can see why you were confused. I think he was being condescending in the beginning for sure which set a negative tone. However, you made matters worse by referring to everything as the seafood department. After you clarified the counter, then he understood.

The missing bit here is that a refund was requested through the app after the shopper replaced them with crab cakes from the sea food department. This is why he's asking "you said yes but then requested a refund"

I think that’s a bit extreme. When dealing with a service via text you have to be very clear or you won’t get what you want. The buyer directed to get seafood department cakes, not specifying behind the counter until it was too late. Tons of supermarkets have seafood you can buy in front of or near the counter that could be considered “the department”.

He definitely had no reason to be short about it. 

These could be from a frozen section in the seafood department and just not from the service case. neither person was being clear about the service case in the beginning, but it was clear enough what was said and no need to be short with your customer about it ever. 

Written communication is harder so don't be rude just because there was a misunderstanding what is the seafood department.

I have to say that this is a very basic misunderstanding. She ordered the lobster cakes so he was clarifying if the crab cakes were okay as a replacement.  Any shopper would have asked bc crab and lobster are two different things.  If I as a shopper would receive a smart answer while I was just making sure it was right I think I would have responded with a smart answer back.

If you happen to be shopping at Safeway via Instacart, these are the only readymade crabcakes they have carried for the past 6+ months. Occasionally, they take them out of the packaging and sell them individually behind the seafood counter, but they come out of that same exact box.

I asked the seafood salesperson about the crabcakes they had on display behind the counter and he went and got the box out of the trash for me.

Seafood counter is not the same as seafood department, and repeating it won’t change that!

There is this mindset people have that whatever one thinks it’s the logical and everyone should understand, but it isn’t!

This is on the shopper. When you are shopping for people and want to get answers and fulfill the order (hopefully getting an increased tip at the end) you need to be clear and concise with your questions and answers. Don't ask 3 or 4 questions and then get answers scrambled. Just skip the item and come back if and when you get the answers and continue shopping for other items. Being a shopper really isn't that difficult.

OP never specified behind the counter until after the fact, they just said seafood department.

OP ordered lobster rolls from the brand pictured which were out of stock, and was offered that same brand of crab cakes as the ONKY AVAILABLE option. 

The food ordered, pictured, and decided on are all in a specific cooler or case adjacent to the seafood counter, as they are not frozen foods, and of higher caliber (like how boars head has coolers next to deli counters, instead of prepackaged lunch meat aisle). This means they are from the seafood department, and definitely constitutes a correct interpretation from the shopper.

Shopper is for sure in the wrong but he’s expecting you to cuss him out like so many others do constantly. It’s almost a ptsd response at this point. He needs to take a break from this gig and reevaluate. OP did nothing wrong.

oooh I wish I would have screenshot the one I had. It was ridiculous. This guy said something was out of stock and asked if I wanted something else. I said no, just cancel that item. To that he asked you want me to cancel the order? I said no, just the item. By the time the message was sent he already cancelled my whole order. He then had the audacity to be mad at me about it. lol

The customer is confusing AF.  Those ARE in the seafood department.  The meat counter is the meat counter.  Then “OK to replace them, but if they don’t have what was ordered, refund it.”  So do you want a replacement or a refund?  Absolutely indecipherable.  Shopper asked for clarification and was understandably frustrated.

If I were the op I'd have said that I only want what they have fresh, not frozen ones and if that's all they have to not substitute and refund the item.

Him...when he started the conversation he was instantly rude, a bit disrespectful. I do think he lost it though. He had me set to want to smack him, then he dropped it and responded like I think anyone would to your confusion. 

That said, it does make sense, given how the words came out, that you misread, which made you confusing. Shit happens. Whoopdedo. He explained what you'd said, you didn't get it, (whoopdedo) and he got a bit frustrated. Understandably

Unpopular opinion I guess but YTA. You saying “seafood department” obviously didn’t register, and being honest I have never heard someone call the actual seafood counter the seafood “department” of the store. You should have just clarified you meant the counter where the worker gets the items for you. And you did it more than necessary. You knew the shopper didn’t know what you meant, so I’m not sure what the point of this even is.

I feel like some of the conversation might be missing to have any better answer here. He was definitely rude about it, probably because he had spent several minutes trying to find you a solution so his tip wasn’t reduced so much. 

I would have simply obliged and apologized for not finding an adequate substitute for you and carried on. I’m sorry this happened to you.

The seafood counter is a subsection of the seafood department. If you wanted the crab cakes from specifically the counter you should’ve said that because those crab cakes he sent you a picture of are from the seafood department like you asked.

Both.... You kept saying in the seafood department. Those in the pic technically ARE in the seafood department. You didn't specify "behind the counter" until after he replaced it with those boxed ones. And you saying "yes,..." twice, made it even more confusing. But also, this entire conversation was confusing and yes he was definitely rude with those smart ass comments bc no matter how much confusion is going on, he could've just politely asked for clarification on what you meant by "seafood department".

I think you’re wrong. You didn’t say from behind the seafood counter until you had said sea food department like 4 times.

He clearly wasn’t understanding and instead of you writing a long detailed response you kept saying the same thing over and over

Everyone is saying this is the shoppers fault but I'm going to go ahead and say this is on you. 

Why didn't you say "behind the counter" the first time? Or second? Or third? You just kept repeating "seafood department". Like, that's a whole damn department and probably where the shopper was looking. 

I agree there was miscommunication and the shopper was clearly frustrated and reacted as such. But you were also unclear and rude IMO. 

Also, you can request items that aren't listed in the app. Scroll to the bottom and there is a "request item" button, where you can describe the item. Or you could put a note on the crab cakes that said "I'd prefer the fresh ones from behind the counter if available". You're making this harder than it has to be.

I guess I have an unpopular opinion because I think u both suck. He sent u a picture of what they had instead of just saying no u started talkin about the seafood department. He was literally telling u "hey this is all they had do u want these or a refund" and u made it annoying and complicated when u could have said no. He sucks because he works in customer service and no matter how annoying a customer is he shouldnt lose his temper on them so his attitude is what is "ridiculous". I dont understand why its so hard for people to be professional for the few hours that they are at work. I work in customer service I have dealt with many rude confusing and annoying ppl would never respond like that to a customer. Wtf

Words use when texting can sound abrupt, but it's much easier to get straight to the point and be clear. Than offer choices that are not clear. The choices he offered went beyond the call of duty. If you didn't like his pick then game over, there's not going to be a 3rd choice or 4th choice, when your shop becomes that picky its time you go to the store.

I think in the initial back-and-forth there was a miscommunication. Saying “from the seafood department” is not at all the same as saying “from behind the counter,” and I understand why there was confusion since all the seafood is in the seafood department regardless of whether it’s fresh from behind the counter or prepackaged in a cooler or freezer. 

I think he was genuinely trying to accommodate you, but both of you became frustrated because of  the disconnect in understanding. After multiple failed attempts at communication, I understand why he said this is ridiculous although he probably should’ve kept that comment to himself. When you decided to respond with saying “I said that like 5 times” it also became condescending towards him. 

I think you both made a valiant effort to be kind but in the end you both let your frustrations out.

If a shopper of any kind is naive, and you're the expert then it's even more so your responsibility to ensure the message your sending is understood by the recipient. 

If he were the team trainer, training other instacart shoppers on the job, he would be responsible for making sure they learn it before they are allowed to work. Its the same premise here.

I don’t think English is the shoppers first language.  I think it was a communication issue all around, nobody is in the wrong or right.

Usually with this stuff it really helps to just remove your ego and also all of the fluff. Example:

Sorry if I wasn’t clear before: here is what I want

I want the crab cakes from the counter, by the little crab legs. The counter where the guy has to get them for you.

If they don’t have those, please just refund I don’t want any other options.

Miscommunication. You couldve simply told him you dont want those kind, and that if they dont have the item you ordered behind seafood counter then youll take the refund. But when he asked should he replace your item with that brand, you said “yea replace with the item in seafood department” which is really confusing. Are you saying “yea” to his replacement with that product? Are you saying that item is t in the seafood department? Are you saying there is another item similar to what you ordered in the seafood department? Or are you saying he didnt check the seafood department for your original item and after checking, if it isnt in stock then just refund?

I feel that Charles is wrong because the customer already said just refund if they didn’t have what they wanted so why continue to go back and forth and say “this is ridiculous” and “I do this for a living”. Even “understand?” In the first screenshot was a bit rude but I would have ignored that if the other rude remarks weren’t made. I do feel like the shopper also confused “seafood department” with “seafood section” and the customer could have made that a bit clearer (like “where you can go ask a human for seafood behind a counter”) but after it became clear that Charles already checked with the people “beyond” the counter then he should have just refunded as the customer said repeatedly.

You didn't say "from behind the counter" until late in the conversation, but that seems to have been a key point for you. There might have been other crab cakes from the seafood department but not from behind the counter. Your texts were hard to follow due to the many run-on sentences you typed.

I think if you need very specific items then you need to figure out an alternative shopping system. I understand folks can’t always go to the store for a number of reasons, but some of the complaints I see about shoppers are wild.

What you instructed was confusing and you were rude to him, too. Never once did you say please or thank you at any point. It reads as though you’re barking orders as opposed to providing instructions. This is not easy work and he’s doing it for a living as he said. Have a little grace. Hopefully we will all survive without our crab cakes.

All you had to say was "no, not those crab cakes. Please refund that item."

He didn't know what a seafood counter was, obviously. You weren't explicit that the frozen things weren't desirable. Both are honest mistakes, but you had more information you did not explicitly state. Not everyone has the same knowledge base you do. Don't start a "no" with the word "yeah."

You said "seafood department". Those crab cakes were in the seafood department. As someone who worked in the deli/seafood department of a grocery store for years, I would say you were in the wrong. Now if you had said "at the seafood counter" or "fresh crab cakes" then the shopper would be in the wrong. But they literally did exactly what you asked them to do.

ESA. It was clear you weren't talking about the ones in the picture with how you responded (unless there is a language barrier but that's not necessarily onyou at that point). Otherwise you wouldn't have said if they don't have them refund. Why wouldn't they have them when he just sent you a picture of them.  But you also didn't actually answer his question and included yes and talk about the seafood department which is vague and confusing. You weren't communicating any better. It's like you were both only half listening. 

His word choice in that early text could be either a language barrier or a bit rude.  But it's not really important because since neither of you were listening to eachother I think declining the order and moving on wasn't a bad thing.

Meh OP- not wrong but not in the clear either. When giving vague directions - don’t be surprised someone isn’t understanding as they can’t read your mind. OP you could have clarified “from behind the seafood counter” if the shopper is not familiar with the product then how tf are the supposed to understand you when you’re not specific. I could clearly see from the first response shopper was confused by what you wanted. I don’t eat that gross shit either so I’d probably be confused too- kinda why I don’t ever have shoppers buy my tampons!! I don’t even want to see what replacement Tom thinks I’d like 😆

I think the “understand” was a language block and him trying make sure you understood that he was trying to explain those were the only ones he could find in the seafood department (which btw you didn’t). That syntax, sounds like a non-native English speaker clarifying. And I’m thinking the “I do this for a living” was him hoping to replace since you tipped by percentage - not like trying to be rude. 

Then you were suuuuper unclear. I mean my god you didn’t even say once, clearly “no I don’t want those specific crab cakes in the pic” you said you wanted the ones in the seafood department - if those were in the seafood department that would have prompted him to take them. Then you ask for a refund and the guy doesn’t understand so tries to clarify since in his eyes you literally just said yes to them. Then you FINALLY say from the man at counter then get real snippy and act like you’ve been saying that the whole time when you haven’t.  

PLUS he already tried to tell you (albeit somewhat poorly)  those were the only crab cakes in the seafood department. 

This is poor communication a bit on both sides but I’m giving that guy more of a pass because I don’t think English is his first language and you clearly answering his question the first time or even second time would have avoided this. You don’t look good in this.

One of my first jobs was for a meat & seafood dept. So what you did wrong here is refer to the fresh seafood counter as "the seafood department". 

Stores have a whole aisle for seafood that's called the seafood department, which includes the frozen bulk in the freezer doors and frozen hip-level tanks

He was right, the ones he offered are the ones from the seafood department, he didn't know you meant the counter till you got zesty with the "5 times" thing . 

I work constuction now, if I have to mention I told someone 5 times to do something on the jobsite, I'm insinuating that they are stupid morons. 

That's why he told you off in a nice-ish way.

Also, I'm not subbed here, it just popped up on my home page . So this perspective is coming from an outsider.

Dude has a poor attitude but something to keep in mind is that you might shop at this store a few times a month . This guy probably has never been to this location before . He checked the area where the food is suppose to be , reported it to you and you told him to check the seafood area (where I assume he was already ) and then followed up with well you have to talk to a guy behind the counter . 

But meh his fault for being so defensive , I would have just been like well you said If they were out refund and they are out . So refund like you said .

Both of you tbh. He was absolutely rude. But he also said clearly on that the picture was the only option. Only as in “there are none at the counter”. You made the assumption he was not smart enough to check that. He made the assumption that you would understand he checked there. You also said “seafood dept” repeatedly instead of seafood counter which is different. It wasn’t until later that you clarified.

Idiot customer uses confusing terminology repeatedly and then after finally using the correct words claims to have said it five times lol.

If you aren't able to intelligently articulate where something is that you want then get your lazy ass off the couch and do your own shopping. You're eating fake lobster cakes but fake crab cakes are beneath you?

It's like you didn't even bother to look at the photo the shopper took and just doubled down on your useless description. Whenever I order groceries I make sure I have the time to assist them throughout the entirety of the trip. It's the least I can do since they are doing me a favor.

Shopper is justified, customer is an entitled jagoff.

You were confusing by saying “yes” to start with but obv no one should be calling a customer ridiculous. That said it’s just some random person who could be having a bad day.

Everything looks fine here on both sides, until "This is ridiculous." (which it wasn't) and "I said that like 5 times." (Yeah, but it took until "behind the counter" to clear up the miscommunication.) In any case, "I feel you're being a little bit rude." should've elicited a "Sorry; the feeling's mutual." instead of a suddenly-cancelled order, IMHO. Bad day, maybe?

You’re clearly at fault you didn’t mention anything about getting them from ‘behind the counter’ in the first half of your conversation. ‘From the seafood department’ is not the same group of words as ‘from behind the counter in the seafood department’.

Just bad communication, he clearly didn't know you meant behind the counter when referring to the "seafood department" and when it was finally clarified that that is what you meant, you acted like he knew that all along, which he clearly did not. From his perspective, the crab cakes he sent a photo of *are* the ones from the seafood section and he's trying to confirm that they are what you want, which they aren't.

The point in which you both understood that the replacement crab cakes you wanted, or refund the order, were from behind the counter in the fresh seafood area, was far too late

This was all on the customer. Two yes responses when they meant no, a weird focus on the location of the product instead of the specific package type shown (misidentifying the problem, they’re both in the same location, same brand, and only one is available). The customer needs to up their reading skills, this should have been a two message interaction.

All you had to say was refund when they sent the picture and made the first comment. They said it was all they had there, what was in the picture.

Could have asked a clarifying question like, “Did you already check at the counter?” Then he’d have said yes and you could’ve been like “ok, thank you, refund please.”

You came off like you were insinuating the guy was inept, then just talked in circles, getting frustrated by your own confusion.

I dunno why you posted this to shame the Instacart associate to be completely honest.  You didn't communicate properly from the get go.  Do you know what's usually by all seafood departments in probably just about every grocery store?  The cold section.  Shouldn't really need to elaborate why they wouldn't have hot rotisserie chicken sitting next to the seafood.  

Yeah they got a bit sassy but your communication could've prevented the rest of your convo with the associate.  Seafood counter vs seafood department.  Department implies the whole fucking area - which almost always includes the frozen section.  

If you went so far as to post this on Reddit with a detailed message over Instacart order, I'd naturally assume you complained to Instacart about the employee.  You should probably reach back out and say that after some thought, you realize you could've done a much better job of learning simple grocery store terms as to not confuse their employees.

This was confusing, I think the customer is in the wrong here. Their communication is bad, they only started to refer to "behind the counter" at the end, they did not say that earlier, but then get frustrated as if they did. No, the customer had bad communication and the shopper was doing their best with the information they had been given. They could have been more polite, but not everyone is a saint, if you're causing them frustration they can communicate that.

We carry the same items in like 3 different places and i see those instacart people scratching their heads trying to figure out which is which. I say to hell with it and they get what they get. If you want to be that damn picky stop being lazy and go shop yourself. 

You didn’t say behind the counter until the very end when the funny part is those crab cakes are the exact same just out of the box. In short you made yourself look like an ass and I don’t blame this dude for being fed up especially when you deal with this all day long.

I think communication was lost on both ends. Of course, the customer will always look better in these situations, but for me, it's not that big of a deal. If you're having to pay someone else to go shopping for you, cut them a little slack, the shopper was just trying to help out as much as he could.

Seafood department is different than seafood counter. Agree to disagree. 

I think there could better communication on both your parts.  Pick your battles. ...You didn't get the crab cakes your belly wanted but they don't necessarily deserve to have their employment jeopardized.

 If they truly suck the problem will sort itself out cause they will eventually quit or be banned from bad reviews. You will survive.

I've had similar situations where I ordered a fresh cocktail sauce or tartar sauce that they keep by the seafood counter (where it's refrigerated). The shoppers usually say it's out of stock, and after some back and forth, they show me they did not go to the actual seafood section because they send pics from the condiments aisle like, "See? It's not here." I'm never rude to them about it, but I just try to let them know they're looking in the wrong place. I totally get the customer's frustration here when you're pretty sure they're not actually checking the seafood section and just in the general frozen food aisle. There seems to be a lot of people in the comments that don't get the distinction for some reason. The way the shopper is snapping at them makes me think they didn't actually check. They could've shut that argument down quickly by sending a picture from the seafood counter to show there's no crabcakes in the case.

Both. The shopper was rude. But the customer was being stupid. And that can be very frustrating. You still can't be rude. But its frustrating.

Honestly the customer texts make me think they were high or tipsy. It's like they had no idea how to say what they wanted. Then once they figured it out, they insisted that's what they had said all along. But it wasn't. So I understand the shopper being annoyed. I'm not a shopper but I've worked enough retail to get it.

He still shouldn't have been rude. Have some professionalism or quit. Dude seems quick to anger and condescension.

All together this just seems to be a case of piss poor communication between a customer with a blunt and a shopper with a chip on his shoulder.

The way you worded everything is unclear-- I think they are totally justified feeling confused. You just continued to repeat the same thing (seafood department, seafood department!) and they aren't understanding over and over.

When I think of "seafood department", I'm not thinking of just the fresh counter-- there are usually frozen seafood items nearby, seafood sides, etc.

You aren't being helpful at all in the way you communicate.

This is why I don't utilize this service. I prefer specific things that don't vary, I know right where everything is, & it'd be too much of a task to explain to someone. Am I crazy for thinking grocery shopping is too personal to depend on a stranger for? There's already option overload as is. My expectations would be pretty low if I were to have someone do it for me. Instacart being a delivery service, I just assume quick, easy, in & out is preferable. This is how people make a living & I respect that. If the app doesn't display an option for what I want, & I'd need to click 1 thing, add a note, modify it etc.. I'm probably just not going to include that item. 




Anyway, I understand there's people that don't have a choice. & there's a need for this service. But I just think we could benefit from putting ourselves in the shopper's shoes. Most of the dilemmas posted here could've been avoided with proper communication

It just seems like a miscommunication, I wouldn’t have known they were behind a counter & had to ask for them before you said that, but he came in with an ego that he could do no wrong and there is nothing anyone can possibly teach him because “I do this for a living.” It’s clear he wouldn’t have admitted to misunderstanding no matter what. He had attitude and you repeated your confusing clarification… (reading it back, I totally get what you’re saying, but in the moment I could see him thinking him offering the frozen thing was in the seafood frozen department and might be what you’re wanting. 

Pic 2’s message from you lacks punctuation after “I want those (punctuation needed here) if you can’t get the crab cakes from the seafood department…” So your lack of punctuation joins your sentences mixing up what you’re wanting & is confusing there.

Overall, for him to cancel your entire order is honestly mean. You cancel because it’s not possible or because the person is downright awful, not because of a miscommunication. Not cool on his part. All he had to say was “i think things got lost in translation. I had already asked the counter & they’re out. This was all they had. I thought this option would help but realize you wouldn’t have wanted these regardless, so I’ll just refund this one”

You were rude. 

First message was him stating the item you wanted wasn’t available a pic of an available alternative and asked if you’d like something else . So far so good. 

You replied you wanted the single crab cakes at the seafood department.  You didn’t specify behind the counter but most should be able to understand your meaning.  Still ok so far. 

He explains that the picture he sent is the only available option. He asks if you would like these or refund the item. He gave you two clear options. 
Still ok so far. 

You replied that you wanted an item that was not available, neither of which was one of the two options he gave you. This is where it goes south. 

You say that you want a refund if they don’t have the ones you want in the seafood department. Again, don’t clarify the ones behind the counter. To him you are both talking about the same thing because the item he showed you was in the seafood department.  Things getting worse. 

He then explains he is confused because you both 
Seem to be talking about the same item from the seafood department yet you want a refund. Again, lack of clarification is causing confusion.  Getting even worse. 

Your next reply is exactly why punctuation is so important. Without it, your message can be taken multiple ways. Now he is really confused. 

He attempts to explain that the item he showed you is from the seafood department. Even shows proof of you saying “from the seafood department”.  Now he is irritated. 

You don’t see the error you’ve made in simply saying “from the seafood department” and try to explain further by saying behind the counter and all that. Getting worse. 

He again reiterates that the “behind the counter” option is not available. Getting more frustrated. 

Now you cop an attitude and claim you said “behind the counter” in your initial messages and  claim to have said it 5 times.  That’s a flat out lie. You initially said seafood department when you probably meant to say behind the counter. Had you admitted the mistake probably could have saved it. Nope. You doubled down.
Getting worse. 

He apologizes even though he hasn’t done anything wrong. The behind the counter option was not available, your replies of “in the seafood department” and lack of punctuation would confuse most people. Based on his tone and apology, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Nope. You still don’t see your mistakes and double down once again even after he apologized and tried to help remedy the situation.  You continue to quote yourself incorrectly. You did not say “behind the counter” until nearly half way through the conversation and it was confusing based on the lack of punctuation. Well, he gone at this point.

You said "from the seafood department" 4 times and each time the shopper said the pictured product came from the seafood department.

You only specified "from behind the counter" at the end.

One of you wasn't listening/comprehending and the other was rude.

I think your wording has confused the driver; The crab cakes pictured are from the seafood department. So the moral of this story is that if you want the correct item; get up and go out and purchase it yourself the old fashioned way. Don’t rely on another person to understand what you are thinking.

I feel like the difference between frozen seafood section and seafood department is pretty obvious. “This is ridiculous” was uncalled for. And the customer did say refund if the fresh substitute was not available.

There was some misunderstanding involved, but the shopper was way too ready to get rude for no reason. That’s not how misunderstandings should go between normal rational people. Shopper is at fault.

Both wrong. Neither listening or asking clarifying questions. "In the seafood dept" was not a clear way to say it, as probably all seafood is "in the seafood dept." 

Probably should have said "the seafood counter" or "do they have fresh store-made crab cakes there? " or something like that. Delivery guy had an attitude too, no doubt. 10% your fault, 40% their fault, 50% just miscommunication

"Yeaah they don’t offer behind the counter crab cakes on the app so I always do those one and right when I get the shopper I tell them I’d like to substitute for behind the counter crab cakes. I’ve never once had an issue."

I get the feeling you're one of those difficult customers and he may have had reason to be frustrated with you. Cause these screenshots obviously only show he's being rude, no one seems to be asking why.

Yo! Okay so I am a spark delivery driver. I had this same scenario happen with a customer of mine on the spark app, minus the weird confusion part lol. They ordered crab cakes from the frozen section, some Gordon Ramsey brand ones or something. Out of stock. I checked the inventory on Walmart app and tried to find crab cakes in general and the only ones around the same price range were over in the seafood department, same exact ones as these. For some reason our system has been recently not allowing us to substitute items if they’re not in the same section of the store, even if they’re essentially the same item. It’ll throw an error code. It’s dumb and unfortunate, need to do updates to fix the app! Biggest issue I have with this tho is the choice of wording by the instacart shopper. They should have been more patient and kind, he was kind of an asshole off the bat. Even a phone call is sometimes needed/more helpful.

I think you were being very short and unfriendly with the shopper to begin with, as well as not very clear. You didn’t say behind the counter ten times, you hadn’t said it at all before that. Anything of the crab cakes or other products in the seafood section that are frozen/refrigerated section are still seafood department. This person is completing a service for you, even if they are being paid, you should still treat them with more kindness and be more grateful.

You didn't say "behind the counter" until the 5th text you sent in these screenshots.

In my opinion, his "please understand I do this for a living" comment was unnecessary and rude. That has no relevance on the conversation, and can really only be taken negatively.

I don't like his attitude. But you didn't say "behind the counter" when he asked about replacing it, and his replacement option seems reasonable.

It started as a miscommunication. She was rude but you demonstrated zero customer service skills. Not in the virtuous sense. In the sense of it making your own job easier. She wanted the crab cakes from the service counter. If the service counter is out or closed, just refund the item. I always send a message before sending pictures of other options. If you identify a miscommunication, politely be clearer about it.

Both, tbh.

The shopper because he was snappy and rude right from the start, and the customer due to the ambiguity of the first part of the conversation. You can easily interpret "seafood department" as either the actual counter where you talk to a worker to get aquarium maintained food, or the seafood area of the store in general.

The customer also didn't make it explicitly clear they were talking about crab cakes *from behind the counter of the seafood department* until midway through the disagreement. The shopper just became more agitated and rude, which also contributed to the fuck up.

There was just some confusion and while it's frustrating, it's miscommunication. Both parties can learn from this experience. Be extra clear. Use punctuation to indicate separate thoughts and clauses. Shopper was correct to double check everything. Unfortunately it became confused. 

Also wondering if the shopper was not reading the request as "if there aren't crab cakes A, then get crab cakes B. If neither, please refund." 

Customer was prob busy and did not make it super clear, but I did understand what was requested. However everyone's reading comprehension is different and if he was tired he may have read it as "you said there are no crab cakes so please refund."

Misunderstanding. Also wow at people who are calling him an idiot. It was a simple mistake and he thought the customer was messing with him due to misinterpreting the message. 

It can happen. Not a big deal. Everyone will get over it.

The customer was being vague and repetitive, and when they ACTUALLY specified what they meant had the nerve to claim they said that five times. No they said it once at the end, got mad, and claimed you're being rude.

I work retail food service, and this kind of shit happens daily. Same kinda person who jams their greasy finger against the case glass and says "I wAnT sOmE oF tHeSe!". Sir and/or ma'am, you're vaguely pointing at a row of six separate items and not even saying how much you want. Use your big kid words and *fucking elaborate* so I don't have to play 20 questions to figure out what and the amount you want. They also REFUSE to even glance at the menu. 

OP is in the right.

I’m not a shopper, but I understood what the customer meant- seafood department is behind the counter or fresh seafood packed on foam trays.  This shopper may not speak the best English, but there was no excuse for them to be so rude.  Especially since the shopper didn’t specify those were the ONLY crab cakes in the entire store that they had.  If they had said that to the customer, they would’ve understood that.

Well if you are the customer then you are wrong. You didn't say behind the counter until the end. You said "seafood department"  they sent you a picture of the only one they had and you said "yes if it's from the seafood dept". Period.   Which were in fact from the seafood dept just not behind the counter (which you hadn't stated yet). So I'm sorry but it's on you for not specifying no you didn't want the ones in the picture if That was all they had. Which he stated it was all they had. It's like you purposely made it difficult to follow by not directly answering the specific question.

But if you are the shopper then no absolutely not. You provided an option and they answered in a confusing way making it seem like they agreed to the picture you sent.

As an ex-shopper these are my least favorite interactions to have. Ask a direct question, get a really obtuse answer and beating around the bush. It's easy to get frustrated when almost every order you shop for is like that. Honestly why I prefer shopping for Shipt rather than instacart -- the customer has to explicitly set their substitution options before the shopping ever starts.

This is a miscommunication. You guys are speaking past one another. 

When you said "seafood department" they thought you meant "frozen seafood aisle". That's why they kept insisting it was from there. 

When you said "behind the counter" meaning like a deli counter thing for seafood, they thought you meant to ask the employee behind the counter, "do you have any of these frozen ones - behind the counter (meaning in the back room and not stocked on the shelf yet)".

Neither of you were wrong. Just bad communication.

He was offering you a replacement in the first place because there were none behind the counter. What you said wasn’t completely wrong- seems you thought he grabbed those crab cakes instead of checking with the counter first. But the way you kept reiterating the same thing made it all more confusing. Start by confirming he checked with the seafood deli counter, and if they did, respond with “no replacement please refund” :-)

As someone who worked instacart, most of the time they specify and show a picture and include expected weight or quantity. So if someone sends you a replacement of different but similar item it really is because they can’t find or don’t have that item. And if they are just cutting corners… it’s a rough job. If you’re capable of going to the store for specific things just run to the dang store

Seafood department =frozen aisle seafood department. He asked is it okay to replace your pack with these, yes or no? You say, "if there are some in the seafood department (yes there was, the cakes pictured) then replace them if there aren't refund them." So basically he asked a yes or no question and you rephrase his question into an if/and/or statement and did not clarify when he was confused. He then said there weren't any behind the fresh seafood counter, but the pictured ones were in the seafood department. Then you doubled down. At that point homie realized he was getting a 2star/low tip, and didn't want to spend the next 30 minutes getting confused over text for nothing.

Both of you are terrible communicators. You didn’t say “behind the counter” initially, you said “in the seafood department” multiple times,  which could be confusing because the seafood department can have multiple sections including frozen fish.  You’re both in the wrong.

Yall both in the wrong. The customer sounds old and if they are old then they did nothing wrong at all. 

As a dasher(using a generic term) you owe the customer excellent customer service. You gotta be able to figure out if this person is old, mentally incapacitated to a degree, whatever. Saying things like "this is ridiculous" makes it sound like this is the only job he has ever had. 

Poor customer service. I door dash and I work dealing with special needs adults and I go to school. I wouldn't talk like that anywhere unless I'm

That’s on you OP. YTA. Expecting anyone to know what crab cakes you mean, only to clarify after soo much back and forth that you meant behind the counter is bizarre. Why not say that from the get go? You’re wasting this person’s time. Imagine shopping for someone else and they actually say what they mean after everyone is frustrated. On top of that you’re taking time from other clear orders that are communicated well and tip well. I hope you did, since that was on you. But your attitude and questioning if you were in the wrong in the first place makes that very questionable. You should have tipped them extra for trying despite your lack of communication.

The part where you say “ I said if you can get the crab cakes from the seafood department, I want those if you can’t get the crab cakes from the seafood department then refund”. 

I there due to lack of punctuation is “I want those if you can’t get the crab cakes from the seafood department”

I agree he is being thick, but it was weird punctuation there and made it a little confusing.

As a shopper I look at it like he started out trying to be helpful but then you were very clear about what you wanted. He should have just refunded it and moved on. For him to cancel your order after that conversation is ridiculous. You did nothing wrong. Maybe that last longer text was a bit much but I understand what you were doing because I would have done that too. Like someone else said they were probably just having a bad day. IMO no one was really wrong (he was overly double checking but that’s better than the shoppers that won’t even attempt to look for an item beyond where it should be) until he cancelled the order. Then he was just being a little B….. lol

**JUST TRANSLATING, NOT MY OPINION**

The buyer didn’t say “counter” in the first interaction. They said “seafood department”.

The instacart person then took that to mean *seafood section*, and went to get the substitution, took a picture to confirm, and received what they took as confirmation.

Later, the buyer then changed the wording to be clearer about what they meant, but the instacart person interpreted that as a different instruction, and complained that they’d already done as ordered, and it’d be ridiculous to change it at that point.

Driver got frustrated because the instructions were a little confusing. Customer did the best they could explaining but it’s still awkward walking thru it solely over text. I can understand being frustrated and I don’t feel like he was being rude per se but he made a few unnecessary remarks. I personally would say it’s a non-issue.

Edit: did not see the part where he cancelled your order. The frustration about the confusing instructions is understandable but cancelling the order completely is a BIT of an overreaction on his part. Like a lot of people in the comments he thinks this misunderstanding is a bigger deal than it actually is.

Well you didn’t say “if not from behind the counter refund” 5 times, you didn’t mention that scenario until you were already being snappy.  You said seafood department, then asked if they got them from behind the counter, then got snappy.  Seems like you’re not communicating what you want very clearly, as “seafood department” isn’t just what is behind the counter.  So I’d put the miss-communication on you.

This is so hard,the first thing you’d have to understand is if there was any crab take talk before this screenshot. 

Second is how long between the last message send before the picture was sent, and when your message was sent to understand the context of the next question.

My inference from the information I gather is that he’s kinda being an asshole at the moment he says, “Please understand I do this for a living.” As kind of a shot at your comprehension of the situation. 

But again without the knowledge, I can see the other side being you are in the wrong…. I really can’t back this up after a third look. I think he’s the ahole. But possibly could have been provoked. In the end your first response to his question is coherent enough to understand you wanted crab cakes made by the in house employee or a refund.

Answer: hire someone to work directly for you and cater to your specific needs. Stop cutting corners it’s making you look cheap and isn’t making your life any easier. 

When my administrative assistant is out for extended periods, I have a borrow from someone else, and notice the difference in quality, simply because she doesn’t know my preferences. I keep this in mind when giving holiday bonus’s and making other decisions for my AA, and would spend double for knowledge transfer should she ever have to leave.

Bottom line: you get what you pay for. It appears you’re at the “buy your own crab cakes level,” which is nothing to be embarrassed about. But you may want to delete this inquiry because it’s very unbecoming.

The shopper had no patience. Honestly, your communication was bad, it was so easy to tell early on that he misunderstood what you meant, and instead of rewording it, you just say the same thing: “from the seafood department”.  Then you finally reword it, saying exactly what you meant the whole time, and claim you “said it five times”.

No one is at fault OP, but it’s clear that both sides could have exercised more patience.

Ngl this whole conversation could've been avoided if you just told him "no not those" he did turn into a prick, but instead of answering to the "are these fine" you seem to have ignored the picture. 

As someone whose worked retail and has done personal shopping like this myself. "Seafood department" usually means everywhere seafood is sold. Not just specifically behind the counter.

It's like asking a shopper to pick you up steak from the price chopper meat dept, but you actually meant the butcher. 

His frustrations lie in lack of clarity.

Also, your statement "I have said this like 5 times" is factually untrue. You said "if they don't have the ones from the seafood department" five times. Not "from behind the counter." You only said that twice, and this was after you blamed him for getting the wrong item.

If you can't find it on the instacart menu you shouldn't be asking for more complicated time consuming steps that people wouldn't be used to in the app. You both were rude to each other, but also I would be mad at you if you talked that way to me after I'm buying your stuff for you and youre putting in weird special requests on the other side of the store for substitutions and shit. If you want something done right then do it yourself, you can't rely on a service and simultaneously piss and shit your pants about it.

Hey if you're this Shopper can you please find another line of work? The customer stated what they wanted very clearly. The only ridiculous behavior was your own inability to comprehend the messages you read. Context clues are your friend.

Maybe I’m in the minority here, but it was immediately obvious what the customer meant to me. Shopper handled this quite poorly.

Crab cakes cannot be found anywhere else except the seafood department, so the fact that their first message mentions it outright is the first clue that they meant to say the seafood counter.

Second clue is that they asked for “single crab cakes,” and those are most commonly found behind the counter.

This conversation never had to go on past the first screenshot. Whether the shopper understood their intent or not, it’s clear that “no individual crab cakes anywhere” = refund.

You're obviously in the wrong. The guys sent a picture and said "do you want me to *replace with these*" and then you just kept repeating "yes, replace with crab cakes from the seafood department."

A reasonable person would've said "no, I don't want those crab cakes, but if they have fresh crab cakes at the seafood counter I'll take those." 

Then you straight up lied about telling him that you wanted them from the counter, when what you said was "seafood department." And ultimately you ordered that same brand of frozen lobster cakes, so it's very reasonable to assume the same brand of frozen crab cakes is what you wanted as a replacement.

You gotta learn to communicate better.

Maybe a No thank you, please refund would've been clearer to him and made him feel appreciated? It sounds like he feels unappreciated after what he thinks is a good alternative, which obviously doesn't work for you. Using 'thank you' and 'please' in the sentence would've been better. At the end of the day, it's no one's fault, it's just one of the downfalls of chatting/texting where you can't tell the other person's tone, so it's a communication issue really.

Seafood department vs isle. There is the context clue for anyone who has actually been in a grocery store. That said OP you could have been a little clearer at the start. That said once you said behind the counter I don’t think anymore explanation was necessary.

Since everything is through text, it’s hard to gauge tone. I’d say the rudeness started with “this is ridiculous”, slightly passive aggressive sending a screenshot of the message you sent them saying to replace with ones from **seafood department**. 

Next time, just go to the store yourself, it’ll be quicker, cheaper, and much less irritating.

You weren’t clear at all. I mean seafood would be in the seafood department. You kept repeating it, and the shopper got crab cakes from the seafood department. At the end you explained it better instead of repeating the same thing over and over you should have stated “ no I don’t want boxed crab cakes, I’d like crab cakes from behind the seafood counter .” You never said no to the boxed crab cakes you simply stated you wanted seafood from the seafood department which is where boxed seafood comes from. To me, it comes off as you’re being intentionally obtuse. And that you did in fact agree to the crabcakes and are now asking for a refund for some inexplicable reason. I think your communication needs to be a bit better. I would’ve been frustrated as well and interpreted Your communication as rude.

OP the miscommunication started with you. If you wanted something specific that wasn't available in the app, you ought to be very clear. The shopper wasn't being an asshole, they were trying to make perfectly sure they were following your request.

I was confused by the customer. He asked if he wanted him to substitute for something else, or if he wanted that item refunded. The customer was like "yes, both." Sounded like he had wanted a refund but also a substitute that came out of the shoppers pocket.

You're the rude asshole here. Shopper told you they didn't have your item and offered a replacement the next message from YOU said " replace with with the crab cakes" that sounds like sure replacement them. THEN you try and argue later that you didn't want those. If you didn't want them you should have just said no don't replace. This is all your fault and you're acting like the shopper is at fault. Learn to communicate better before you bitch about people being dumb.

Aside from some wording that kind of comes off as rude or whatever pedantic argument about what “seafood department” colloquially means or whatever , I’m on the shopper’s side. The shopper asks if the customer would like him to replace the specific crab cakes the customer wanted with the ones in the picture and the customer literally responds immediately after with “Yes replace the crab cakes from the seafood department”not “I’d like a refund instead” ??? Case closed.

The confusion started with “replace with the crab cakes from the seafood department” - the crab cakes you originally ordered? The same crab cakes that weren’t available and the shopper is now offering you a replacement?

I’ve shopped for instacart and have used it to order. I’d guess the shopper is easily annoyed here because the customer is taking up their time. This is also probably why they said they do this for a living. The item wasn’t available. The instacart shopper provided an alternative. Either accept the alternative or get the refund. Going back and forward with your shopper is annoying and they’re rightfully annoyed.

I have no idea what instacart is, but the customer 100%.

The person said they didn't have what the customer wanted, but sends a picture of a similar product to see if that was fine. The customer said yes to replacing them, then immediately demanded a refund? That would confuse the shit outta me too. Hell, it did, I had to reread the post 5 times to even understand what the customer wanted.

So then the customer gives them contradictory requests, so they try to sort out the confusion. Only for the customer to double down.

This all could have been avoided with a "I will take the refund, thank you for asking though."

Your communication isn’t clear. You should have made it clear that you didn’t want the crab cakes in the picture. What the fuck is a seafood department? I have never heard that terminology used to describe the fish counter at a supermarket. Is the seafood section of the frozen food section part of the seafood department? Do you call the area where the baked goods are the baked goods department?

You're not a professional, you don't have expertise I don't, you go grocery shopping, you can send a child into the store to do what you do, and they literally hire anyone with a vehicle.

Delivery driver is in the right. Order recipient changed wording from seafood department to behind the counter. Itself explanatory when delivery driver took picture and said this is all they have. Order recipient being very difficult and not accepting what they wanted wasn’t at the store.

It looks like there was a miscommunication in there and then both of you ended up assuming the other was being rude.  I don’t think the shopper understood that you wanted me them to go to the seafood counter and thought that they were already in the seafood department because they were in the aisle with the frozen seafood. It could be that English isn’t their first language and it didn’t make sense to them, or it could just be that they needed it communicated more clearly.  They got frustrated with you and then you felt they were being rude unprovoked.

I try to be really clear with these delivery apps because I don’t know if the person on the other end is a native English speaker or not. Sometimes what we think is simple, isn’t.  This request ended up being one of those things that only made sense to one of you and it led to total confusion.

The keyword for me was "single" crabcakes. The type where they're made onsite and they're like next to open trays of shrimp, scallops, fish fillets, etc, in a display case. You can buy 1, 31, or whatever amount you want. They then wrap up the amount you want, set it on a scale, if they're priced by the pound, then print off a sticker with price, barcode, weight etc then slap it on the white butchers paper after wrapping it up for you. 

This was a misunderstanding.

Q: How did you take a picture of the exact item they wanted if it was out of stock?

I’m gonna say you are wrong simply because he’s trying pretty hard to accommodate you and you are being a little unclear. maybe next time say to go to the counter and ask the seafood counter etc

But also because even though it’s his choice as a job to be doing this I could never see myself waiting around for an answer on replacing items like this.
I try to picture if I sent my girlfriend to the store for me and she’s trying to find something they don’t have , unless it’s absolutely dire  I’m probably just going to be thankful she tried and happy I didn’t have to go myself. 

You aren’t an asshole at all or wrong on some moral level, just think this shopper did more then a lot would have and was unlucky in communication and seafood stocking clearly lmao

Perfect example of why texting as your main communication method is never a good idea. I don’t even text my closest friends and family this much and y’all are out here having full blown paragraph back and forths via text with Instacart about specific groceries to buy?

We all played the telephone game in our lives at least once yes? Everyone knows info is lost and not easily communicated via text messages. Especially specifics and detailed things like this. Just seems like a waste of time for the worker and frustrating for the customer. Just go get your groceries yourself unless you have a disability or something.

I am thinking what you meant was fresh/not frozen crab cakes, or prepared in house, from the seafood department. 

But, at one of the stores near me the seafood area has frozen crab cakes right there. So the ones showed would also be from the seafood department. 

Seems like miscommunication on both sides. The shopper says "this is all they have," and then that was ignored and you started saying about the seafood department rather than clearly answering the question. So if these were also in the seafood department that created confusion. The question should have been answered first: do you want these, yes or no. Then you say "check if they have any at the seafood counter that aren't frozen please" 

Two separate statements rather than a questionably worded if-then statement

He was unnecessarily rude from the get go, but to be fair your communication wasn’t the best here. He asked if you would like something else and sent a picture of something else and you responded to the text but ignored the picture, which would have confused me as well. And you kept saying seafood department, which was obviously where he was, when you meant seafood counter, which was confusing. Seems like just not great communication all around.

You could have been ten times more clear than you were. He clearly got those from what would be a seafood section. You should have said from the beginning, no I don't want those. If they don't have the ones at the seafood COUNTER where he hands them to you then please don't replace and just refund that items. Sounds like miscommunication and you both doubling down saying the same fucking thing you said two seconds ago to each other without clarifying better because you obviously weren't getting each other. So both of you sounded rude. But he was definitely more rude in his interaction.  Just move on from this experience.

After 3 long years I finally quit Instacart for this reason. I got a full time job and signed up for Shipt.When they increased the delivery fees, it made it made things harder for the customer. By the time the customer pays for their order,and pays for their fees there’s really not much left for most  families to tip me in my neighborhood. Perhaps it’s different in a other areas with higher income brackets, such as Connecticut where I previously did Instacart. But here in upstate New York, a rural town where job opportunities are far and few between;not to mention the cost of living and inflationary prices,most people here are struggling on food stamps. While giving great  customer service was easy to do on my part, the really awful shoppers on the platform made it harder to to keep customers coming back. I had Instacart customers constantly complain to me about other shoppers and asked for me to shop for them exclusively over and over and over again . Shipt has become available in my neighborhood and even though the customer is not required to tip upfront, I am helping the same people that I used to help on Instacart,and I am having a way better experience and getting much better pay for my shopping.The minimum order I have seen come through shipped is $16. I also like that there’s rating forgiveness through shipt and I’ve only had one instance where I’ve had a poor rating. I’m never expected to drive farther than 10 miles to complete an order, and the best part that my customers seem to love is that they can request me as a preferred shopper. When I’m available within the time bracket that I have scheduled, I can shop for the people who actually like me, who I know for a fact will tip . I also like the fact that I can make notes about customers that I’ve already helped multiple times.For example two people decided not to tip me and I was able to notate that they did not tip, which means I don’t waste my time taking orders from people who wouldn’t tip or give me a poor rating . It saves me time and energy and now everyone in town who likes to shop on the shipt platform gets to work with shoppers who they like. One weekend, I was able to make $200 on shipt. Last month trying to make $200 through instacart on a weekend seemed impossible. The orders were all 3 part 20 miles trips.I would often be out eight hours a day slaving and shopping for people in the area only to come home with $90 to my name. Or waiting for a decent order all day.As opposed to when I first started making $400 back in 2020 it seemed so easy to do in a matter of hours. I always maintained a 5 star rating and got crappy treatment from customers service.Instacart treats, their shoppers like crap, and it’s simply not profitable anymore especially when we are using our own car, gas and time to make things happen for people in the community.

You could do what my last shopper did. He didn’t start shopping on the order until 2 hours after my delivery was supposed to arrive and then proceeded to state that every single item on my list was not in stock. I obviously canceled the order paid the $20 bucks and he probably pocked that money? I dunno how it works but I assume you’d get something out of the deal. Obviously a short term solution since I won’t be using Instacart again. I went to the store myself and all the items were there!

There has to be some sort of minimum wage legal ground to open up a lawsuit at this point. Min wage is $16 here and I frequently see batches like this that would take at LEAST an hour for under $15, factor in gas and it seems criminal for Instacart to get away with such low pay outs…

I also have days like that. I feel like morning orders pay better though, at least in my experience. I hope you’ll get higher paying orders soon because those are definitely not worth the miles. Usually if I am only seeing orders like this I just switch to DoorDash until something good comes up.

# Post ID 18t176d: No payment from Instacart for over 4 weeks with +25 score by [elvisphilips on 2023-12-28](https://www.reddit.com/r/instacart/comments/18t176d/no_payment_from_instacart_for_over_4_weeks/)

Please I wish to bring this to all shoppers attention, a pressing matter regarding non-payment for my services over the past four weeks. Despite my numerous attempts to address this issue through the provided channels, I have yet to receive a resolution or any communication on the matter.

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, but the prolonged delay in payment is causing significant financial strain. I have followed the prescribed steps for issue resolution within the app and have also reached out to customer support without success. Please has anyone experienced this with Instacart and how were you able to resolve this and get your money?

To try and reset the whole issue, can you open a free digital bank account like SoFi or other, and then use that new account for instant cashout? 
Sounds like their internal system is missing a routing number or digit was pulled wrong from your info. So even tho correct on your side, the system is jacked.

I'm not sure if anyone has mention this, but I would look into the Department of Labor in your state and file a claim against Instacart. Even as a 1099 independent contractor, you are due what's owed to you. I bet you that will hurry things along really quickly. Copied this from Google: file a complaint with their state's Department of Labor for unpaid wages, but they should also file a claim with the Federal Department of Labor, which enforces the FLSA, otherwise known as the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Hope this helps.

This is bringing back flashbacks. I paid for a $33 order with my own card because their card had a glitch or something. The app says you get repaid in a couple of days. Riiiight! Their responses were so similar to the ones they sent you! Also, none of the 20 pics of the receipt I sent them were good enough. The screenshot of my bank account showing the payment wasn’t good enough. It was driving me crazy. For my own sanity, I ended up telling them to keep my money as Instacart obviously needs it more than I do. Lesson learned!

I'm not a shopper, but Instacart canceled my plus membership 5 months ago due to fraudulent activity (someone hacked my account), and I have had zero luck getting my membership back or a refund.

I don't know if Instacart does this but on the chat they said you changed your bank info. On doordah when you change bank info you can't use instant cash out for like 7-14 days(I can't remember the exact time). They do this because there is fraud where scammers get into shoppers accounts and change the bank info and cash out the money. So they make you wait a while to be able to cash out. I would suggest trying to call and not using chat for this

I’m confused on the issue you are having, if you can’t cash out then the money would of been transferred to your bank on a Tuesday or Wednesday?

If that didn’t happen then are you saying the money shows up on Instacart still? Even weeks after that pay week? 

I have never had that issue and I’m a 6 year shopper, normally once you link your bank, it’s going to be transferred automatically each week unless you sign up for instant cash out. 

My only other suggestion is to try twitter, instagram as they respond fairly quickly and are good at helping. Also, follow up with the ticket numbers they provided and ask for a status update. They have to give a reason before closing those tickets out usually.

Lastly, ask to speak to a tier 3 supervisor, they are a boss over a regular supervisor and they have more power to do things. They are also American customer support agents who are knowledgeable. Customer support will try to talk you out of needing one but don’t give up, insist on speaking to one and finally, only the financial department can resolve this issue. Ask them to escalate the issue to that department and they should be able to resolve it more quickly.

Again, I’m sorry you’re going through this issue.

# Post ID ilu91y: Can the Instacart shopper not see the replacements I have specified? with +21 score by [turkeypants on 2020-09-03](https://www.reddit.com/r/instacart/comments/ilu91y/can_the_instacart_shopper_not_see_the/)
When I shop my groceries on the site, I pay attention to and use the replacement function. If they're out of strawberry yogurt replace with coconut, if they're out of tangerines give me navel oranges, if they're out of organic give me regular, or whatever.

But periodically my shoppers text me replacement questions that I've already specified the answers to in advance and I'm like, read the thing. Can they not see it? Is it not obvious in their interface?

I'm not always available to text with them while they shop and I'm just curious why they don't seem to be aware of my replacement choices.

They should be able to see them, but there's always a chance something is wrong and they can't for whatever reason. This app can be screwy at times. I personally find that if you put notes under the item specifying what works for replacements they're more likely to see them. Plus, you can be much broader there rather than 1 specific item. "If not available please replace with coconut, if no coconut i like anything BUT blueberry and banana. Please stick to BRAND OF YOGURT". Its a bit more work but its there forever when you order the items.

Unfortunately, Instacart has made their system very draconian and unforgiving in how shoppers are treated.  Shoppers are often deactivated (i.e. fired) suddenly, without warning, and for vague or no reasons.  Customers are allowed to remove the whole tip and give low star reviews after delivery for no reason.  Everything is automated, and most all shopper attempts at appeal or even human intervention fall on deaf ears.  A few 4-star reviews or even a single no reason 1-star review WILL block a shopper’s access to good batches for weeks.

So what you wind up with is many good shoppers who give up and quit in disgust, lots of new shoppers who don’t know what they’re doing taking their places, and most of the remaining good shoppers working under a cloud of paranoia and fear.  Everything is CYA for shoppers who cannot afford to lose this gig or their ability to see good batches due to one bad Karen customer that the automated IC system always defers to and believes. 

So while I can see your selected Customer Choice backup that may make perfect sense, I still want to see your quick text ok or review ok on my making that substitution for THIS order (notes and choices carry over to future orders).  If that ok never comes, then I am risking a bad review here, and there is NOTHING that support will do about it when you never approved that substitution.  You may be a great customer, but there are lots of Karens and Kyles our there who aren’t.  It sucks, but that is the system that Instacart has set up.

They dont see your  replacement choice until the shopper marks the item as NOT FOUND. Then it says second choice....try this. Then your replacement pops up. Most likely they have not seen it. Maybe they are new to using the app. They just see your item out of stock and ask you not remembering you could have possibly picked a replacement.

What are you talking about after? You should be scanning the items as you grab them not running around the store grabbing what you see then scanning them before you check out. That’s lazy and how mistakes happen. I’m glad they allow us to take our tips back for bad or poor selections and service. I had a chick mad at me because she didn’t or couldn’t read and follow my clear instructions for delivery. You bet your dollars I took my tip back her attitude was wrong cause was on the wrong street and her selections where horrible and she ran around the store collecting my items before scanning them so she could SEE what I wanted if I wanted something else and so can others if ppl stop trying to cut corners. Insta pays ppl to shop that’s why I pay a yearly fee the tip is for going above and beyond. I’m also a insta shopper so what the app may have some tech issues but it allows you to reach out if you don’t see replacements or refund options and they can see if you tried to reach the customer. That’s why most shoppers get deactivated for not even trying.

Another huge problem is that the “Customer Choice” replacement put up by the app is a lie sometimes.  I have had some customers say no I did not put that I would never choose that brand.  

Instacart needs to get their shit together and keep suggested replacements labeled as such. At this point I have zero trust that “Customer Choice” means anything more than a suggestion. 

tl;dr - Customers should just write something out in a note.  IC shenanigans has made the backup choices an unreliable crapshoot.

OK there's a real problem. If you believe it was the customer's choice but they legit didn't pick it this time or any time prior, that's guaranteed to cost the shopper a ding that's not their fault, yet isn't the customer's fault either (assuming they're not lying or forgetful). That stinks.

> mark “wrong item” with replacements.

I wonder if you can tell if that is on products they have deliberately specified or if it's ones the store has suggested to you, the shopper, when the customer leaves the default "let your shopper pick" setting in place. Like what if the customer chose spinach but specified no replacement, might the system direct you to pick arugula and you wouldn't know who chose that? Just trying to figure out how the system works.

Another explanation in your particular "wrong item" scenario, since it remembers replacements, might be that the person once specified a given replacement, but has since forgotten or changed their mind, and you dutifully replaced as directed, but now they don't want that thing and find out too late and forgot they asked for it at some point in the past.

It is so rare for the customer fill that information out I usually don’t look their first. But after the first replacement it becomes clear and I’ll check on the replacement item if necessary. As some have said I still communicate just in case there are any questions. The last issue is Instacart will recommend replacements too so I want to make sure the communication is clear with the customer before I replace your organic orange juice with hand sanitizer.

I think it is completely made up. I mean, replacing gluten-free or organic items with conventional? I now keep a note that we have celiac, multiple food allergies and chemical sensitivities (seriously, if my youngest gets exposed to some things, her mental health and behavior seriously decline for a week or more), some of which are not very common, so please ask before making any substitutions.  And some items are not where you expect them to be in the store, so if unsure, let me know-- I can, 9 times out of 10, tell the shopper where the store hides said item.

I wish Instacart customers realized that they tip people who deliver food and restaurant wait staff much more than they do instacart shoppers! 
Someone who shops your groceries, selects quality products, waits in line, bags your items, and delivers a month or weeks worth of groceries to your door deserves more than a 5% tip!
Even restaurants have a 15% gratuity!
A 5% tip shows you don’t appreciate the service being provided to you. And I don’t blame the customers it’s INSTACARTS FAULT!
… That is all. As you were lol

Edit: thank you to the ones who defended me, i was in an accident a year ago and have been disabled and struggling to get back on my feet. I only use instacart to get ebt items and i tip what i can and i always explain my situation and apologize. I will always try to tip as much as possible when i can and I appreciate everything the shoppers do and wish so much that they made what they deserve because the help they give me is so much more than they know.

Personally I only judge when I see a small tip ($1-$4) or no tip from a rich customer. For example those who live in mansions & in condos downtown.
Second when I see no tip ESPECIALLY if it's a mansion or condo. 

If its a low tip or no tip from a low income area I understand or the hood. I grew up in the hood so I know a lot of people rely on food stamps in those areas. I don't judge duplexes, if anything I feel bad when they tell me to leave cold items outside & they are at work. I fear someone might take it and there goes their weekly food money. 

A $3-4 isn't bad as long as you don't live in a mansion or rich condo which I'm guessing isn't your case since you mentioned you use food stamps. Thank you but don't feel bad, we definitely understand that some people have disabilities & rely on us to get their groceries and only give what they are able to afford. Even if you only tipped $1-2 dollars , I would understand. Being disabled is not something you can control, & I hope you can get approved for disability.

IC shoppers get paid $7 by Instacart per order. It might increase up to a couple of dollars with heavy pay. They also get 100% of customer tips.

We as shoppers are paid $7/order. That's it. And there are many times a shopper only receives one order in 2+ hrs. Not to mention our fuel costs, vehicle maintenance,  tires, brakes. There was a time (before everyone started doing it) that it was a great gig. Not anymore.

There’s a reason for this actually. If we got tipped appropriately Instacart would lose shoppers when they need them. A lot of shoppers would go offline after making 100 bucks or so. How do you stop that? Encourage lower tips. It’s super fd up. But that’s my conclusion

I am a customer and I 100% agree.  Honestly, I still think you'd get bad tippers who won't care what IC suggests.  Still, I think it is the very least IC can do to reach some people who would realize, "Oh, I have been undertipping".

As a customer I totally agree. They make it way too easy to just do 5%. I tip 15% minimum and I feel like they should at the very least have it default to 10% as a starting point And recommend or mention that shoppers rely on tips.

I think they make it 5% to not make it seem so expensive with their fees. Their fees are pretty steep IMO (yes I still pay them).

>I think they make it 5% to not make it seem so expensive with their fees. Their fees are pretty steep IMO (yes I still pay them).

This is probably it exactly. They want people to keep using their service, and one way to achieve that is to have customers leave low tips so they don't get turned away from the fees.  The fees used to be so reasonable, but they are getting so high now. Yes, I will also pay them and continue to tip my usual 20%, but I can see how some might not.

I worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years, most of that time I worked as a server. In order to preserve my sanity, I stopped working in that industry altogether back in 2020. I got laid off because of covid and decided I wasn't going back, even though I tried working in restaurants again in 2021, which didn't end well.

I went from that to driving for DoorDash, which I did for close to two years. Then I started instacart, now I rarely do DD. In my experience, it is true that people tip servers more on average. However, I will say that I've never worked in a restaurant that implemented a mandatory gratuity. At least in my state, they've pretty much abolished forced gratuity. Some restaurants are able to add a gratuity for large parties, but many don't even do that.

Also, in my experience, the tips for food delivery, at least on DD, are well below the average on instacart. That's why I quit DD, it's just not worth it. Shopping an order is far more intensive than delivering food, but delivering food uses a lot more gas and results in more wear and tear on the vehicle. That's just my personal experience, though.

All of these services should be compensated adequately with tips. I had no idea that instacart was encouraging 5%, that's just ridiculous. When I worked as a server, I dealt with so many customers who barely tipped or didn't tip at all, it was infuriating. I went from that situation, into the same situation with these gig apps. I still prefer working for instacart because I can choose not to take those orders without tips. As a server, not only was I forced to wait on people who I knew wouldn't tip me, I had to do it with a smile on my face.

Right!. Leave it blank. Let the customer decide. IMO tips are a scam being played by employers. Restaurants are the biggest. They make bank on food and expect the customer to pay server wages.

Yes. The instacart chat support system is almost completely and totally broken. Use the phone support whenever possible. Chat support agents regularly retaliate against shoppers. They do things like logging the shopper out of their account 7 or 8 times while they're working on an active batch to prevent them from shopping. They do things like canceling orders after checkout and before delivery has been made to give shoppers a 24-hour shopping ban. They do things like flagging shopper accounts for deactivation, flagging shopper credit cards as "lost" when a shopper hasn't lost a card to try and prevent The shopper from working. They do things like canceling a batch and using the wrong reason code to try to artificially raise a shopper's cancellation rate. 

I've been doing this on and off for 4 plus years, and every one of these things has happened to me. But I can see from reading the instacart subs on Reddit that it happens to a lot of other people exactly the same. It takes a lot of time, energy, and persistence, but it's possible to reverse all these changes and report the agents who retaliate against you. I just screenshot every single chat with support since this has happened. The chat agents seem to have a feature that alerts them when we take screenshot of the chat. Usually, this leads to much better service, clear and understandable communication, and a quick resolution to the problem.

50% of the time I get really helpful and great agents, but the other 50% of the time the chat support is incredibly horrible, unworkable, and totally useless. Instacart is testing/trailing phone support in certain markets for shoppers who are on an active batch. I can't recommend the phone support enough if it is available in your market. Almost every issue has been resolved on the phone within 3 to 4 minutes of the call starting. With chat support, I'm usually waiting 3 to 4 minutes for every single reply that they send.

Some support agents will definitely retaliate against shoppers for low ratings. It's probably not as common as it seems based on posts here about it. Like a lot of other things that get posted people are more likely to post about bad experiences. Not as many people are going to make a post about rating a support agent 1 star and nothing happening after that.

That being said even though I think it's rare the risk doesn't seem worth it to me. I think you're better off just ending the chat and getting a new agent if you get a bad one and just don't rate them anything.

They can deactivate your shopper card, log you out of your account, cancel orders you have at any point in time, among other things.

I don't know this for sure but lately I've been starting to suspect that support has to flag a shoppers account for things like this to go to trust & safety which is a different department. T&S I'm pretty sure are actually corporate workers while shopper support reps are just contracted out. T&S has a lot more power over deactivating shopper accounts.

IC likes to automate things as much as possible so I doubt they have anyone at T&S reviewing every cancellation or shopper bump. Also some shoppers cancel orders, or remove customers from doubles & triples all the time, or request shopper bumps all the time, and nothing happens while other shoppers report getting warning e-mails after the first time they do these things.

Did you know that if you don’t rate any agent lower than 5 stars you never have to worry about being singled out?

If you could just keep your emotions in check and realize they probably weren’t trained correctly and just move onto another agent that may know or can assist you better.

Yesterday I saw a batch that was in the Colorado mountains while it was snowing foggy, and snow tires were required.  Because I don't have 4 wheel drive, no snow tires, and wanted to avoid risk, I did not accept the batch.  

Minutes later, a new batch came up closer, so I accepted it.  One order in the batch was close by, but the second order was the same order in the mountains that I tried to avoid.  I did not know this until delivery time.  Now, I had to deliver it, though.  I attempted to get to the next order issued after the 2nd delivery, and I got stuck in the mountains, and my car nearly slid off a cliff.  My rear tires were inches from the edge.

I contacted IC aboit 20 times by chat while on the edge of a cliff. They did not allow calls to support even in this emergency situation.  

I was livid and did not know what to do!  I provided app improvement suggestions but complained that I could have been killed in this situation.  I gave a 1 star rating for every attempt to contact IC support in an emergency situation, where I was unsuccessful.  

Later that day, my card was mysteriously deactivated without reason or explanation.  This is so unfair.  IC simply stated that it was deactivated, without reason, and that there was nothing I could do but order a new card. 

Now, I am out of work until a new card arrives if it ever does.  

I feel that this mysterious deactivation was retaliatory.  Post and YT state that chat support is outsourced and they regularly retaliate if given 1 star ratings.
