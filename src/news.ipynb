It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

This decision has affected a considerable portion of its workforce, although the exact number of employees impacted has not been disclosed. The layoffs are described as a strategic move aligning with the company’s broader shift towards a licensing model for its software solutions.98point6Founded in 2015, 98point6 initially flourished as a virtual primary care provider, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This success was marked by a significant funding round of $118 million in late 2020. However, the company has faced various challenges since then, including a high-profile leadership shakeup in 2021 and previous layoffs in July 2022. In 2023, 98point6 pivoted from direct healthcare services to focus on licensing its technology to other healthcare providers, following the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent.Background and Challenges in the Health Tech SectorThe shift in 98point6’s business strategy comes amid broader changes and challenges within the health tech industry. Following a boom during the pandemic, many companies in the sector are reevaluating their business models in response to evolving market demands and financial pressures. This transition from service provision to technology licensing reflects an attempt to leverage their proprietary software in a more scalable and economically sustainable way.Moreover, the technology industry, in general, has been experiencing a wave of layoffs as companies adjust to post-pandemic economic conditions. The tech downturn has not spared the health tech sector, with 98point6 and others finding it necessary to streamline operations and reduce costs to maintain financial health and operational agility.A Personal Take on the Future of Health TechFrom my perspective, the trajectory of 98point6 highlights both the potential and the volatility within the health tech industry. On one hand, the shift towards software licensing is a strategic move that could potentially offer more stable and recurring revenue streams. This approach also allows the company to capitalize on its technological innovations without the complexities and overhead associated with direct patient care.However, these layoffs raise concerns about the impact on employees and the local tech ecosystem, especially in Seattle, where 98point6 is a significant player. The health tech sector’s rapid evolution demands adaptability, but also poses risks to job security and company stability. While the strategic pivot might be necessary from a business standpoint, it underscores the broader challenges facing tech companies in achieving sustainable growth post-pandemic.In conclusion, the future of 98point6 and similar health tech enterprises likely hinges on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry landscape, balancing innovation with economic realities. The success of their new business model will depend not only on the technical prowess of their software solutions but also on their ability to navigate the complex healthcare market, which is fraught with both opportunities and obstacles.Related articles',\n",

Currently, more than 43 million people have access to MDLive virtual urgent care through their health plans and employers, Cigna says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDive Insight:\\nAsynchronous virtual care allows clinicians to review information, render a diagnosis and prescribe needed medication without communicating in real time with a patient.\\nA crop of startups, including Bright.md, Zipnosis and 98point6 — as well as nontraditional entrants like Amazon, with its telemedicine marketplace\\xa0— are peddling asynchronous care tools that allow patients to triage low-acuity healthcare needs without having to rely on costlier avenues of care like an emergency department visit, or wait for a primary care appointment.\\xa0\\nWhen asynchronous care launches next year,\\xa0MDLive users will be guided through a digital clinical interview that will be converted into a chart note. A clinician will review the note and provide a diagnosis or prescription, or direct the patient to a different care setting if needed, according to Cigna.\\nAt a time when insurers are facing growing public scrutiny over their use of algorithms to review claims, Cigna’s release on the new offering says the asynchronous care experience “is not based on artifical intelligence or machine learning.”\\nAn Evernorth spokesperson said Bright.md’s platform uses branching logic to identify and ask follow-up questions, and all decisionmaking is done by the treating clinician.\\nHowever,\\xa0Bright.md in past releases has said its software uses AI\\xa0to inform new questions based on information provided by the patient.\\nPortland, Oregon-based Bright.md was founded in 2014 as a virtual care platform for direct-to-patient telehealth. The startup,\\xa0which has raised roughly $31 million to date,\\xa0sells its software to health systems, including West Coast system Adventist Health, Prisma Health in South Carolina and Rush University Medical Group in Chicago.\\nIn those deals, a clinician (normally an urgent care provider)\\xa0employed by the system is used to staff asynchronous care. At Cigna, patients who take an asynchronous visit will be treated by MDLive clinicians, according to the Evernorth spokesperson.\\nCigna will license Bright.md’s technology back to the company in a continuing services agreement so its health system clients can continue using the platform, the spokesperson said.\\nCigna purchased MDLive in 2021\\xa0as demand for virtual care snowballed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "I’ve been spending a good amount of my free time lately in early-access life sim Palia. Since its early access launch, I’ve found myself returning to my human’s comfortable home to garden, hunt, and hang out with friends. Palia has become my Stardew Valley-esque chill game of choice.\n",
      "The idea of a cozy MMO was a little barebones at the start of the game’s life — but developer Singularity 6 is supporting the title with regular updates, so the concept is much clearer now. I’ve started to not just encourage my friends to play Palia with me, I’ve started making new friends in the game. \n",
      "As a rule, I tend to play most games solo unless I have my pals around to join me. After playing a whole smorgasbord of online titles, I’ve learned that most communities are full of rude dudes who will drop some slurs on you for the slightest of infractions. Palia, on the other hand, has a delightful community. \n",
      "During the past few days, I’ve noticed some encounters that warmed my tired, pessimistic heart. A bunch of players were in Kilima Village, jumping in a circle, complimenting each other’s outfits. People call out resource drops and put on fireworks shows as they wait for people to show up and get the special ore or wood. Players will glibly chat about romances and share their favorite villagers in chat. Chefs plan cooking parties, inviting people without well-equipped kitchens or scores of supplies to come on over to their place and make some delicious fare.\n",

      "Image: Singularity 6\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At launch, and for most of the game’s lifespan so far, Palia worked best as a solo player — with only a few exceptions. Cooking, for instance, has always been a social mechanic that worked well. Flow groves — magical trees that spawn at night in Bahari Bay and require multiple players to cut — were a later addition that forced people to work together. But for the bulk of the day, I would be alone — it simply worked best that way. If I had friends online, we’d chat on Discord as we did our own things in-game and occasionally linked up.\n",
      "Over the last few months, Singularity 6 added some more features to encourage party play, and they’ve done an excellent job at making Palia feel like an actual MMO. The first is a party bonus; now, if I’m rolling around with someone, that gives both of us a chance at double loot. Playing in a party can also earn some special furniture, so I have plenty of reasons to round up a couple of pals before I head out to hunt and forage.\n",
      "The second recent addition is the hot pot tables in the Grimalkin underground. At night, I retire from the fields and go to the underbelly of Kilima Village, a black market where the capitalist cat Zeki sells paintings, rugs, and other high-end goods. The underground has tables where players can compete in a simple tile-matching game called hot pot in groups of four. Playing hot pot gives coins, which I can cash in at a prize wheel for furniture, high-end ingredients, gold, and more.\n",
      "Palia has always excelled at being a cozy game, similar to Stardew Valley, but the multiplayer aspect felt a little perfunctory and unnecessary. Now, it’s worth finding a few buddies. In other games, I might resent this — why do I have to go and play with Randy Rando? But in Palia, I’ve been shocked at how pleasant the experience is. Everyone is incredibly nice. In fact, the harshest in-game interaction I’ve seen was someone griping that people were running past the bugs he was trying to catch and spooking them — hardly a toxic interaction.\n",

      "The writing in Palia is also surprisingly good. I recently delved into the Temple of the Roots with my robot boyfriend, only to find him imperiled by an ancient caretaker we found in the facility. With the power of friendship, I was able to free him, and learn more about the mysterious world of Palia in the process. These narrative chapters are a big reason I enjoy the game, but they are infrequently released. The social aspects of Palia, however, are more easily accessible.\n",
      "As a tired gamer who has experienced tons of multiplayer environments, I’ve learned to largely keep to myself. Palia, at the start of its early access journey, felt less like a MMO than a solo game that happened to have other people. As Singularity 6 updates the game, the developer has done a great job at making it feel more social. The game has had a rocky development with rounds of lay-offs, but I have hope that the continual updates and polite player base will lead it to eventually flourish. \n",
      "For now, I’m enjoying the chill vibes of Palia, and it’s nice to have a new place to make friends. The villagers of Kilima are great, but they can’t compare to the pleasures of playing with other people.\n",
