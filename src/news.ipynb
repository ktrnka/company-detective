By enabling healthcare organizations to license this additional model of care delivery, 98point6 once again sets the bar with an integrated, purpose-built clinician solution that future-proofs virtual clinic operations. In related news, the company announced it has doubled-down on its growth strategy, acquiring the remaining assets of Bright.md following the sale of its technology to Evernorth, and continuing to service long-time customers Baptist Health, UAB Medicine and 14 others.\\nThe Balancing Act: Addressing Clinician Burnout and Patient Preferences\\xa0Clinician burnout is rampant, with over 45% of healthcare workers feeling burnout often or very often. Meanwhile, patients are embracing digital solutions: 64% want to receive some, most, or all of their health care virtually or online in the future. By giving providers the flexibility to support multiple modes of digitally communicating with patients based on their lifestyle and care preferences, 98point6\\'s asynchronous virtual care module helps mitigate clinician burnout while enhancing the patient experience.\\n\"In more than two years on the platform, Bright.md exceeded our high expectations for an asynchronous digital health partner,\" said Brett Oliver, MD, Chief Medical Information Officer at Baptist Health. \"As our patient and clinician needs evolve, we look forward to establishing a new\\xa0 partnership with 98point6 Technologies to extend our patient offerings, drive operational efficiencies and further advance our mission of providing innovative, quality care to the people of Kentucky and southern Indiana.\"\\nAsynchronous care delivery represents the next service offering for 98point6 and a commitment to growth since launching as a licensed software provider last year. The async software offering enables providers to respond when their schedule allows, backed by a solution that takes clinical decision support to the next level. The robust technology deploys machine learning models to establish an intelligent engine that supports providers with intake, diagnosis, and care documentation.\\xa0Developed by a team with a proven track record of building and managing a successful nationwide virtual clinic serving millions of patients, the module paves the way for further innovations.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"Our mission at 98point6 is to build market leading technology that empowers healthcare providers with the tools they need to broaden access, enhance patient engagement, and achieve cost savings through greater provider efficiency,\" said Jay Burrell, CEO of 98point6 Technologies. \"With the Bright.md acquisition we are dramatically accelerating our efforts to offer a robust, multi-functional virtual care software platform and it\\'s a tremendous opportunity to engage with these 16 innovative health systems.\"\\xa0\\nFor more information on the new asynchronous offering, visit 98point6.com.\\nAbout 98point6 Technologies98point6 Technologies builds and licenses software to power exceptional virtual care experiences for providers and patients based on years of clinical use across millions of patients.

This decision has affected a considerable portion of its workforce, although the exact number of employees impacted has not been disclosed. The layoffs are described as a strategic move aligning with the company’s broader shift towards a licensing model for its software solutions.98point6Founded in 2015, 98point6 initially flourished as a virtual primary care provider, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This success was marked by a significant funding round of $118 million in late 2020. However, the company has faced various challenges since then, including a high-profile leadership shakeup in 2021 and previous layoffs in July 2022. In 2023, 98point6 pivoted from direct healthcare services to focus on licensing its technology to other healthcare providers, following the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent.Background and Challenges in the Health Tech SectorThe shift in 98point6’s business strategy comes amid broader changes and challenges within the health tech industry. Following a boom during the pandemic, many companies in the sector are reevaluating their business models in response to evolving market demands and financial pressures. This transition from service provision to technology licensing reflects an attempt to leverage their proprietary software in a more scalable and economically sustainable way.Moreover, the technology industry, in general, has been experiencing a wave of layoffs as companies adjust to post-pandemic economic conditions. The tech downturn has not spared the health tech sector, with 98point6 and others finding it necessary to streamline operations and reduce costs to maintain financial health and operational agility.A Personal Take on the Future of Health TechFrom my perspective, the trajectory of 98point6 highlights both the potential and the volatility within the health tech industry. On one hand, the shift towards software licensing is a strategic move that could potentially offer more stable and recurring revenue streams. This approach also allows the company to capitalize on its technological innovations without the complexities and overhead associated with direct patient care.However, these layoffs raise concerns about the impact on employees and the local tech ecosystem, especially in Seattle, where 98point6 is a significant player. The health tech sector’s rapid evolution demands adaptability, but also poses risks to job security and company stability. While the strategic pivot might be necessary from a business standpoint, it underscores the broader challenges facing tech companies in achieving sustainable growth post-pandemic.In conclusion, the future of 98point6 and similar health tech enterprises likely hinges on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry landscape, balancing innovation with economic realities. The success of their new business model will depend not only on the technical prowess of their software solutions but also on their ability to navigate the complex healthcare market, which is fraught with both opportunities and obstacles.Related articles\\n', 'https://www.axios.com/pro/health-tech-deals/2024/01/16/98point6-acquires-brightmd-assets-telehealth-care-enablement': None, 'https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-98point6-inc-files-to-say-raised-2/brief-98point6-inc-files-to-say-raised-29-1-million-in-equity-financing-idUSFWN1M10QV/': None, 'https://leadiq.com/c/point-technologies-inc/5a1d98e42300005400877e7d': None, 'https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/': '\\n# URL: https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/\\n\\nSteadyMD News\\n\\n98point6 Technologies Collaborates with SteadyMD to Offer Comprehensive Virtual Care Solution to Healthcare Organizations\\n\\n\\nOctober 9, 2023\\xa0/ by SteadyMD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest-in-Class Technology and Highly Trained Clinicians Helps Understaffed Healthcare Organizations Lower Costs, Reduce Burnout and Manage Patient Workloads\\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON – October 9, 2023 – 98point6 Technologies, a leader in virtual care software, today announced a new strategic partnership with B2B telehealth infrastructure provider, SteadyMD. Together, these leaders will provide an all-in-one virtual care offering to healthcare organizations that combines 98point6’s cloud-based, licensable technology with SteadyMD’s 50-state network of highly-trained clinicians to help short staffed healthcare organizations lower the unit economic cost of care operations, reduce provider burnout and manage escalating patient workloads. \\nWith an estimated shortage of 200,000 nurses and 50,000 physicians over the next three years and with more than 50% of U.S. hospitals operating at a deficit in 2022, health systems face significant financial and operational challenges. The text-first 98point6 Technology Platform, coupled with SteadyMD’s technology, clinical operations and clinician workforce, will enable organizations, such as health systems with in-person care, to create new revenue streams, increase provider efficiency and reduce administrative burdens — making their hybrid and virtual care strategies a reality.\\n“98point6 Technologies brings a keen understanding of how technology can lower the cost of care while also providing the best patient and provider experiences possible,” said Guy Friedman, co-founder and CEO of SteadyMD. “Our new all-in-one virtual care solution promises to revolutionize healthcare delivery, ensuring providers have the tools and support they need to provide accessible, high-quality patient care.”\\nThe 98point6 Technology Platform provides the backend infrastructure that enables healthcare organizations to innovate and quickly reimagine new economic models at scale.

Based around a flagship Clinician Console, the 98point6 Technology platform is a scalable, cloud-based platform that helps providers conduct efficient, high-quality patient visits.\\nBuilt-in logic, in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated clinical support tools, guides providers to quickly make the right medical decisions and provide care for more than 4,000 conditions virtually or seamlessly direct patients to the right in-person follow up care when needed. Automation built into the platform limits care variability, optimizes patient and provider time by streamlining the intake process and reduces cognitive load on clinicians so they can more effectively and efficiently practice at the top of their license. \\nThe SteadyMD clinicians work shoulder to shoulder with a client success team and clinical operations team to deliver effective and efficient clinical care. Through careful planning and monitoring, the team ensures that patients are seen in a timely manner, programs are staffed effectively, and clinicians are trained and confident in their use of the technology platform and their knowledge of customer and use case-tailored clinical protocols.\\nThe 98point6 and SteadyMD offering to healthcare organizations includes:\\n\\nA digital clinic hosted in the cloud that seamlessly integrates with existing systems including EHRs, and is secure and compliant (HIPAA, SOC 2)\\nAn AI-enhanced patient entry point that can be white-labeled with a healthcare organization’s brand\\nA Clinician Console with configurable workflows, automated clinical decision support tools, support for multi-patient chat, and care follow-up and documentation tools\\nTraining and development for clinicians and staff\\nA 50-state network of clinicians, a client success team and a clinical ops team delivering on-demand and scheduled virtual care \\n\\n“Together with SteadyMD, we’re paving new ground by equipping strained healthcare organizations with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of today’s healthcare environment,” said Jay Burrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of 98point6 Technologies. “At 98point6, we believe in being more than a digital health solution; we’re a helping hand in transforming the healthcare landscape.

With DataFirst’s Silverback platform and close partnership, they achieved their goal. Here’s how.\\nAt the 2023 Annual RSNA Conference (RSNA23), Healthcare IT Today arranged for an exclusive interview with Beau Jones, President & CEO at DataFirst and Jeff Emery, CIO/CTO at Envision Radiology to learn more about their deep collaboration.\\nSharing Imaging Information \\nEnvision Radiology offers medical diagnostic imaging services including MRIs, CAT scans, X-rays and more through seven imaging centers in Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. Their team is committed to providing “warm and enjoyable” medical services through the latest imaging technology with the fastest turn-around times in the industry.\\nAccording to Emery, in order to achieve the last part of their mission, the fastest turn-around times for results in the industry, Envision needed to “have control over our DICOM layer which includes the routing, the morphing, and the syntax.” Only with this level of control could Envision connect with their healthcare partners and share imaging information quickly.\\nRapid and Flexible Interoperability\\nSilverback is an enterprise-grade imaging interoperability, integration, and workflow solution that helps healthcare organizations easily connect/manage the inflow and outflow of images. What sets the solution apart is how rapidly it can be connected to different vendors and partners that an organization needs to share imaging information with.\\n“We have seen our partners go through mergers and splits,” explained Emery. “We work with different radiology groups, remote radiology groups, and local radiology groups. Each have their own unique way of sharing information. There is no one-size fits all.”\\nWith DataFirst’s Silverback platform, Emery and the team at Envision are able to on-board partners faster than ever before. The platform also allows them to quickly adapt to changes in those data connections.\\nMore than Just Technology\\nEnvision chose Silverback not just based on the strength of the technology but because of the supporting team of experts that came with it.\\n“Technology, like a race car, is fantastic, but just having the best tech will not win you the race,” said Jones. “You need a team of experts surrounding you and supporting you to get the best out of the technology. That’s what we do at DataFirst. We have the best technology and we pair it with a team who walks beside our customers to tune the platform so it performs the way they need it to.”\\n“We are innovators,” added Emery. “We like to see innovation in our partners and that is why we chose DataFirst. Their platform allows us to have control over our environment rather than the environment controlling us. We wanted a partner that was willing to sit with us and help us in the trenches to get the job done. DataFirst gets it and they really understand what it means to be a partner.”\\nTrue Partnership\\nJones races his hand-built Ginetta car in the Ginetta GT Racing series, so he knows how the car + driver + pit crew need to be completely in-synch with each other. All three need to constantly provide feedback so that adjustments can be made to the changing conditions.\\nThat is exactly how Silverback + Envision + DataFirst work together.\\n“Like in racing, Jeff and the entire Envision team have pushed the boundaries of what our product is capable of doing,” stated Jones. “They have asked for things that the product didn’t do, but when we looked at it, it made a lot of sense to add it into the platform. They and all of our customers have made us a better company.”\\n“We have a solid team at Envision Radiology,” said Emery. “DataFirst also has a solid team. Together we are brothers in arms.”\\nThe collaborative efforts of Envision Radiology and DataFirst showcase the power of innovative partnerships in driving positive change. With a shared commitment to patient-focused solutions, they are operating like a well-oiled machine that is moving at the pace demanded by the healthcare industry.\\nWatch the interview with Jeff Emery and Beau Jones to learn:\\n\\nWhat a “deconstructed PACS” is and why it is central to the Silverback platform\\nHow patient-centricity is baked into the workflows at Envison Radiology and enabled through Silverback\\nThe latest interoperability challenges faced by radiology organizations\\n\\n\\nLearn more about Envision Radiology at: https://www.envrad.com/\\nLearn more about DataFirst at: https://www.datafirst.com/\\nListen and subscribe to the\\xa0Healthcare IT Today Interviews Podcast\\xa0to hear all the latest insights from experts in healthcare IT.\\nAnd for an exclusive look at our top stories,\\xa0subscribe to our newsletter\\xa0and\\xa0YouTube.\\nTell us what you think.

Founded in 2015, the company initially operated as a virtual primary care provider but has since pivoted to focus on licensing its technology to healthcare providers. The flagship product, the 98point6 Technology Platform, is a cloud-based software solution that integrates artificial intelligence and automated clinical support tools to enhance virtual care delivery.\\n\\n## Key Developments\\n\\n### Acquisitions\\n- **Bright.md**: On January 16, 2024, 98point6 announced the acquisition of Bright.md's remaining assets, which includes 16 customer contracts and the sales and customer success teams. This acquisition is part of a strategy to enhance its asynchronous care capabilities, allowing healthcare providers to communicate with patients at their convenience ([PR Newswire, Jan 16, 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).\\n\\n### Partnerships\\n- **SteadyMD**: In October 2023, 98point6 formed a strategic partnership with SteadyMD to provide a comprehensive virtual care solution.

However, the company has faced challenges, including a high-profile leadership shakeup in 2021 and layoffs in 2022 and 2024 as it transitioned to a licensing model ([Pragmatic DLT, Apr 24, 2024](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)).\\n\\n### Business Model Transformation\\n- The company has shifted from direct healthcare services to a licensing model for its software solutions, following the sale of its virtual care and primary care operations to Transcarent in a deal worth up to $100 million. This strategic pivot aims to create a more scalable and economically sustainable business ([Healthcare Dive, Jan 17, 2024](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)).\\n\\n## Opinions and Market Position\\n- 98point6 is recognized for its innovative approach to virtual care, particularly in addressing clinician burnout and enhancing patient engagement. The asynchronous care module is seen as a significant advancement in the telehealth space, catering to the growing demand for flexible healthcare solutions ([PR Newswire, Jan 16, 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).\\n\\n## Key Personnel\\n- **Jay Burrell**: CEO of 98point6 Technologies, who emphasizes the company's commitment to empowering healthcare providers with advanced technology ([PR Newswire, Jan 16, 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)).\\n\\n## Scale and Reach\\n- 98point6 Technologies has developed a robust technology platform that has been utilized by millions of patients. The company aims to expand its reach through partnerships and acquisitions, positioning itself as a leader in the virtual care market.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n98point6 Technologies is navigating a transformative phase in the health tech industry, focusing on software licensing and strategic partnerships to enhance its offerings. The company's recent acquisitions and collaborations indicate a strong commitment to innovation and addressing the evolving needs of healthcare providers and patients.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Sources\\n1. **PR Newswire** - Jan 16, 2024 - [98point6 Technologies Announces the Acquisition of Bright.md to Accelerate the Launch of its Asynchronous Care Module](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-technologies-announces-the-acquisition-of-brightmd-to-accelerate-the-launch-of-its-asynchronous-care-module-302034295.html)\\n2. **Healthcare Dive** - Jan 17, 2024 - [98point6 buys Bright.md’s remaining assets](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/98point6-buys-bright-md-assets/704661/)\\n3. **Pragmatic DLT** - Apr 24, 2024 - [98point6 Undergoes Significant Workforce Reduction Amid Business Model Transformation](https://pragmaticdlt.com/news/98point6-undergoes-significant-workforce-reduction-amid-business-model-transformation/)\\n4. **SteadyMD** - Oct 9, 2023 - [98point6 Technologies Collaborates with SteadyMD to Offer Comprehensive Virtual Care Solution to Healthcare Organizations](https://www.steadymd.com/blog/98point6-technologies-collaborates-with-steadymd-to-offer-comprehensive-virtual-care-solution-to-healthcare-organizations/)\\n5. **Vator** - Jan 16, 2024 - [98point6 buys contracts from Bright.md, launches asynchronous care module](https://vator.tv/news/2024-01-16-98point6-buys-contracts-from-brightmd-launches-asynchronous-care-module)\")\n"
