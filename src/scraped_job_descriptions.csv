## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

## **The Role**

From transcribing medical conversations to delivering key takeaways, our trailblazing work in machine learning research makes the Abridge experience possible. We're currently looking to hire research scientists with experience in machine learning and natural language processing. The ideal candidate will bring technical mastery, fluency with foundation models, genuine interest in the medical domain, and strong critical thinking skills to the role. At Abridge, all of our ML work has a strong research component, and all of our research scientists contribute directly to real products that impact the lives of doctors.

## **What You'll Do**

* Advance the state of the art in medical NLP, in areas including conversation summarization, evidence extraction, outcome prediction, evaluation techniques, and experimentation.
* Actively contribute to the wider research community by sharing and publishing original research
* Help to define important problems, identify appropriate baselines, develop state-of-the-art methods, and ship them into production.
* Dial deeply into real-time feedback from clinicians to guide further refinements and innovations
* Be results-oriented in the face of ambiguous problems and uncertain outcomes

## **What You'll Bring**

* Strong research background, as demonstrated through papers and a graduate degree (MS or PhD) in Electrical Engineering, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, or equivalent experience.
* High-impact publications at peer-reviewed AI conferences (e.g. \*CL, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR).
* Significant real-world impact, as demonstrated through open source contributions and deployed technology.
* Strong programming skills with proven experience crafting, prototyping, and delivering machine learning solutions into production.
* Experience with deep learning libraries (e.g. PyTorch, Jax, Tensorflow) and platforms, multi-GPU training, and statistical analyses of observational and experimental data.

**Base Salary:**
$200,000 USD - $300,000+ USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

**Must be willing to work from our SF office at least 3x per week**

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco within 6 months of accepting an offer.

**Must be willing to travel up to 10%**

Abridge typically hosts a 3 day builder team retreat every 3-6 months. These retreats often feature internal hackathons, collaborative project sessions, and social events that provide the team with opportunities to connect.

We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

**The Role**

As a Senior Implementation Manager at Abridge, you will play a critical role in ensuring the successful deployment and implementation of Abridge products and services with our customers. You will be the primary point of contact for our valued partners and you will be the driving force behind seamless project execution. You’ll use your exceptional communication skills as you work closely with internal and external stakeholders to deliver projects on time, while exceeding the needs and expectations of our users.

Ideally, you thrive in a startup environment, specifically with a culture that’s built on seeing obstacles as opportunities, having a bias toward execution, being a little nerdy and perpetually curious, and helping teammates succeed.

**What You'll Do**

* Lead customer implementations and serve as the primary point of contact for Abridge's partners during their initial deployments. Be the person who instills confidence + trust in our partners and team, drives on-time implementations with high NPS, and ensures our pilots convert to full enterprise partnerships.
* Own the creation, coordination, and execution of project plans, in collaboration with internal and external cross-functional teams.
* Accountable for leading through each of the project phases, including kickoffs, technical configuration, testing, clinician training, go-live, and post-live stabilization.
* Identify and manage project risks and issues, and develop contingency plans as needed.

* Set the standard for what incredible communication looks like. Communicate project progress and issues to internal and external stakeholders in a timely and transparent manner.

* Push our goals forward, and be the one to drive forward progress with our partners and internally.
* Collaborate with support and operational management to identify and implement areas for process and tool improvements in a dynamic and growing environment.
* Participate in the creation of repeatable processes that will scale with the growing number of concurrent implementations our team will need to support

**To be successful in this role, you:**

* Have a track record of driving successful healthcare technology implementation projects from initiation to completion.
* Excel at communication and can synthesize information in a concise way.
* Are extremely organized. You’re able to manage multiple priorities at once, while maintaining attention to detail and quality.
* Can work with speed and are results driven. You seek continuous process improvement, driven by efficiency. Your role will involve rapid decision-making, quick execution, and maintaining an unwavering commitment to precision and quality in every aspect of implementation.
* Build strong relationships with various stakeholders at our partner sites, to ensure a long lasting partnership.
* Use data to tell a story about pilot performance and to inform tactical plans that ensure pilot success.
* Have the ability to smell smoke and escalate early, with proposed solutions.
* Are creative and scrappy with strong problem solving skills, tactful conflict resolution skills, and a bias to action.
* Have 5+ years of experience in project management, with a focus on software deployment and implementation at B2B companies.

**Ideally, you have:**

* Experience implementing electronic record systems. (Epic is a definite plus.)
* Familiarity with systems requiring strict adherence to privacy and security protocols.
* Knowledge of tiered support organizations and escalation protocols

**Must be willing to travel up to 20%**

## **Why Work at Abridge?**

* Be a part of a trailblazing, mission-driven organization that is powering deeper understanding in healthcare through AI!
* Opportunity to work and grow with talented individuals and have ownership and impact at a high-growth startup.
* **Flexible/Unlimited PTO**
  — Salaried team members can take off as much approved time off as they need, plus 13 paid holidays
* **Equity**
  — For all salaried team members
* **Medical insurance**
  — We pay 100% of the premium for you + 75% for dependents. 3 Aetna plans to choose from.
* **Dental & Vision insurance**
  — We pay 100% of the premium for you + 75% for dependents. 2 Aetna plans to choose from.
* **Flexible Spending (FSA) & Health Savings (HSA) Accounts**
* **Learning and Development budget**
  — $3,000 per year for coaching, courses, workshops, conferences, etc.
* **401k Plan**
  — Contribute pre-tax dollars toward retirement savings.
* **Paid Parental Leave**
  — 16 weeks paid parental leave, for all full-time employees
* **Flexible working hours**
  — We care more about what you accomplish than what specific hours you’re working.

  — We provide up to $1,600 in a one-time reimbursement to set up your home office.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

**The Role**

As an Implementation Manager at Abridge, you will play a critical role in ensuring the successful deployment and implementation of Abridge products and services with our customers. You will be the primary point of contact for our valued partners and you will be the driving force behind seamless project execution. You’ll use your exceptional communication skills as you work closely with internal and external stakeholders to deliver projects on time, while exceeding the needs and expectations of our users.

Ideally, you thrive in a startup environment, specifically with a culture that’s built on seeing obstacles as opportunities, having a bias toward execution, being a little nerdy and perpetually curious, and helping teammates succeed.

**Your responsibilities:**

* Lead customer implementations and serve as the primary point of contact for Abridge's partners during their initial deployments. Be the person who instills confidence + trust in our partners and team, drives on-time implementations with high NPS, and ensures our pilots convert to full enterprise partnerships.
* Own the creation, coordination, and execution of project plans, in collaboration with internal and external cross-functional teams.
* Accountable for leading through each of the project phases, including kickoffs, technical configuration, testing, clinician training, go-live, and post-live stabilization.
* Identify and manage project risks and issues, and develop contingency plans as needed.

* Set the standard for what incredible communication looks like. Communicate project progress and issues to internal and external stakeholders in a timely and transparent manner.
* Develop and execute against comprehensive testing plans with our most strategic partners, including tracking all issues, triaging, and driving towards daily testing goals.

* Collaborate with support and operational management to identify and implement areas for process and tool improvements in a dynamic and growing environment.
* Participate in the creation of repeatable processes that will scale with the growing number of concurrent implementations our team will need to support.

**To be successful in this role, you:**

* Have a track record of driving successful healthcare technology implementation projects from initiation to completion.
* Excel at communication and can synthesize information in a concise way.
* Are extremely organized and detail oriented. You’re able to manage multiple priorities at once, while maintaining attention to detail and quality.
* Can work with speed and are results driven. You seek continuous process improvement, driven by efficiency. Your role will involve rapid decision-making, quick execution, and maintaining an unwavering commitment to precision and quality in every aspect of implementation.
* Build strong relationships with various stakeholders at our partner sites, to ensure a long lasting partnership.
* Have the ability to smell smoke and escalate early, with proposed solutions.
* Are creative and scrappy with strong problem solving skills, tactful conflict resolution skills, and a bias to action.
* Have 3+ years of experience in project management, with a focus on software deployment and implementation at B2B companies.
* Experience implementing electronic record systems and leading through build and testing phases. (Epic is a definite plus.)

**Ideally, you have:**

* Familiarity with systems requiring strict adherence to privacy and security protocols.
* Knowledge of tiered support organizations and escalation protocols.

**Must be willing to travel up to 20%**

## **Why Work at Abridge?**

* Be a part of a trailblazing, mission-driven organization that is powering deeper understanding in healthcare through AI!
* Opportunity to work and grow with talented individuals and have ownership and impact at a high-growth startup.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

## **The Role**

Our generative AI-powered products are bringing joy back to the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for engineering managers to support our growing team of US-based, full-stack software engineers. You’ll support a team doing both frontend and backend development, working primarily in Typescript, React, NextJS, and Node.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers.

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

## **The Role**

Our generative AI-powered products are bringing joy back to the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for a security-minded fullstack software engineer to join our growing US-based engineering team. You’ll contribute new functionality to our products and serve as a subject-matter expert for application security within the team. You’ll work primarily with Typescript, React, and Node.

## **What You'll Do**

* Design, build, and support the robust cloud-native applications, services, and APIs we need for our rapidly-growing business.
* Serve as a subject-matter expert for application security. You’ll perform secure code reviews; help lead our security working group; and champion secure coding practices within the engineering organization.
* Research commercial and open-source solutions, and make build vs buy recommendations to bring new capabilities into the technology organization.
* Enhance existing systems to add new functionality, and to improve performance, stability, quality, and security. Make quality-of-life improvements to the codebase, and help limit the growth of technical debt.
* Build deep user empathy and maintain a user-centric mindset
* Communicate regularly and effectively within and on behalf of our cross-functional product delivery teams. You’ll work with other disciplines including design, product, machine learning, and platform engineering, and will have opportunities to learn from and contribute to projects across the company

## **Who You'll Bring**

* 7+ years of software engineering experience, with several years of experience building and shipping cloud-native applications, preferably with Typescript and React.
* Passionate about software security, and experienced at multiple levels of the stack. You can determine whether a piece of code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack; write a SAML integration; debate the relative merits of CBC vs GCM; and architect a system with appropriate data segregation for confidential data.
* Experienced working in a regulated environment. You have worked with compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HITRUST.
* Up-to-date on industry best-practices and tools, and enjoy learning new things
* Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment
* Willing to pitch in wherever needed - as a fast-moving startup we need to do good work, quickly

**Base Salary:**
$185,000 USD - $265,000+ USD per year + Equity

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

**Must be willing to work from our SF or NY office at least 3x per week**

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco or New York.

**Must be willing to travel up to 10%**

Abridge typically hosts a three-day builder team retreat every 3-6 months. These retreats often feature internal hackathons, collaborative project sessions, and social events that allow the team to connect in person.

We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

## **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

## **The Role**

We’re looking for Staff & Senior Full Stack Software Engineers to join our growing Product Engineering team! You’ll play a key role in helping us scale and mature our business by building and supporting new + existing web applications and their supporting backends. You’ll be writing code (mostly Typescript), making architectural decisions, recommending technologies to adopt, and ensuring that our systems scale up reliably and securely.

## **What You'll Do**

* Design, build, and support the robust cloud-based services we need for our rapidly-growing business
* Make and implement technology decisions that support business needs without compromising security, privacy, or quality
* Research commercial and open-source solutions, and make build vs buy recommendations to bring new capabilities into the technology organization. You’ll have a say in the technology strategy — not just implementation details
* Enhance existing systems to add new functionality, and to improve performance, stability, quality, and security
* Advocate for high standards; make quality-of-life improvements to the codebase; and help limit the growth of technical debt
* Build deep user empathy and maintain a user-centric mindset
* Communicate regularly and effectively within and on behalf of our cross-functional product delivery teams. You’ll work with other disciplines including design, product, machine learning, and infrastructure, and will have opportunities to learn from and contribute to projects across the company
* Mentor and learn from other engineers

## **What You'll Bring**

* 5+ years of experience building, shipping, and operating cloud-based distributed systems at scale - You’ve seen what works, and probably a few things that didn’t work. Your opinions are grounded in experience
* Experience as a lead engineer on a number of major components or subsystems of a software platform, or have been the lead for the platform itself
* Confidence knowing your way around event pipelines and experience with tools such as Kinesis or Kafka
* Several years of experience building software for a regulated environment, and understand the tradeoffs that can be required to ensure compliance with regulations and frameworks such as HIPAA, SOC 2, and HITRUST
* Willingness to pitch in wherever needed -- as a fast-moving startup we need to do good work, quickly

**Base Salary: $185,000 USD - $265,000+ USD per year + Equity**

The salary range provided is based on transparent pay guidelines and is an estimate for candidates residing in the San Francisco and New York City metro areas. The actual base salary will vary depending on the candidate's location, relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and other job-related factors. Additionally, this role may include the opportunity to participate in a company stock option plan as part of the total compensation package.

This position requires a commitment to a hybrid work model, with the expectation of coming into the office a minimum of (3) three times per week. Relocation assistance is available for candidates willing to move to San Francisco or New York.

Abridge typically hosts a three-day builder team retreat every 3-6 months. These retreats often feature internal hackathons, collaborative project sessions, and social events that allow the team to connect in person.

We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

## **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.
