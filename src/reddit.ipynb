      "My Japanese wife and I live here and have been talking about starting a family. The overwhelmingly major sticking point that makes the decision really hard is the work culture here. Money and living situation are not serious issues in our decision. My wife is HORRIFIED of how she will be treated in the office after giving birth, and horrified of how she will be viewed if she applies for a new job. I think this is a huge reason for why Japan finds itself in this position.\n",

      "To be perfectly honest I’m a victim blamer in this situation.  As other people have pointed out, it’s mostly the insane working culture that contributes to this.  Thing is, that’s basically self imposed.  For example, many Japanese employees will not leave work until their boss leaves.  Even if they have nothing to do they will sit there for hours in order to conform to the social standard.  There are some fields, like animators, that are extremely overworked but in many cases people are spending way more time at the office than they actually need to.  Not to mention the insane amount of time you’re expected to spend drinking with your coworkers after hours.  Worst case scenario is you get some dirty looks or people talking behind your back for going against the convention.  As far as I’m concerned that’s no reason to give up your life.  Your company is not your family.\n",

      "This might have worked when only men were employed, but like other 1st world countries, both the men and women tend to work these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think there’d be serious consequences for refusing to take part in this then just look to the common policy of assigning an employee no work.  Rather than fire you, Japanese companies will simply assign you nothing to do and wait for the shame of it to get you to quit.  As a meme I saw said “a few Italians would bring the Japanese system crashing to its knees.”  Which is absolutely true.  You get a few southern Italians in there and they’d be sleeping in that office, leaving at 5, and collecting paychecks until they were dragged out.  Shit, I would too.  No fucks given about any kind of “shame”.\n",

      "I wonder if there’s any link between a country becoming a pop culture trend in the West and having a shrinking population. When a country’s music, movies, or fashion become globally popular, does it somehow relate to fewer people being born there? Maybe as people start to see their culture gaining value internationally, they want to enjoy and participate in that spotlight. Potential parents might feel that having a child could hinder their ability to fully experience and grow with their culture. It’s interesting to think about whether all that international attention affects demographic trends or if other factors, like the economy or personal goals, are more significant. It would be fascinating to explore if there’s actually a connection or if it’s just a coincidence.\n",

      "Explain how any of these countries are making having a family feasible to counter a declining population rate? Looking at average salaries, two adults have to work, pay rent, living expenses, and daycare. The math isn’t mathing. I luckily was able to have two children, I work as a teacher, my husband is a mechanic. We bought our home 12 years ago. I have no idea how we could make this work now. We both make barely more than we did at that time and housing has more than doubled. I am guessing there is a similar trend in every foreign  country you look at. We are living in an oligarchy folks contrary to what you’ve been told. Corporations are going to bleed us dry. They will face a vacuum of economic contraction they have only kicked down the road. The reality of survival is so bleak for couple we can no longer have children based on the economics constraints imposed by the corporate machine… of course which are in bed with all elected officials and the legislation they have crafted over the last 60 years.\n",

If we change the paradigm where people actually make what their effort is worth and actually start breaking monopolies up with a side of taxing billionaires into literal extinction we would have the resources to take care of everyone.  People are more productive than ever.  There is no willingness to share in the spoils.\n",

      "This isn't a problem, the problem is the expectation of perpetual economic growth. The world is not meant to have a limitless supply of human beings, sorry for the economy, but governments around the world should be trying to envision a world that doesn't rely on an infinite number of people being produced. Where is the logic in the madness of treating human beings like numbers that must always go up? It is a bullshit idea that should be seriously debunked at this point, for the sake of all of our futures, and the future state of this planet.\n",

Cuz in nature animals have the normal incline and decline in population, so I feel like it’s the same way for Japan.
