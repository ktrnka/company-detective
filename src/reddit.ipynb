The summary should cover all the key points and main ideas presented in the original text, while also condensing the information into a concise and easy-to-understand format.

      "I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.\n",

Is My Singing Monsters that fuckin lucrative? (Finally saw an ad for it and holy shit rofl)<br><br>Comment by TommyHamburger on 2024-07-02 [+69 votes]:<br>The devs made a big deal of their monetization model in [a blog](https://palia.com/news/palia-business-model) before release. In short, they only planned to monetize cosmetics, but they'd be up front about changes.  <br><br>Anyone that's played a Daybreak game can tell you that's not how they operate. Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming. When I messed with Palia briefly, it seemed like the most obvious cashgrab would be to sell wait time reduction on crafting or building objects. Can't wait to see how they ruin the game.<br><br>Comment by Cavissi on 2024-07-02 [+50 votes]:<br>Palia was a big miss for me, and I'm basically the intended audience. I love cozy and crafting games, and love mmos. But it had none of the charm that most good cozy games have, and pretty awful monetization.<br><br>Comment by Kofinart on 2024-07-02 [+21 votes]:<br>Not like Palia was doing that well in the first place<br><br>Comment by LostMinimum8404 on 2024-07-02 [+14 votes]:<br>Palia was such a let down. The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it (like adding a well requested thing behind a paywall) or instead of adding actual meaningful content they add costumes which sucked and were overpriced. Not even to get into the “mmo” aspect of the game. It’s barely a multiplayer you could go your entire Palia career and never talk to a person<br><br>So I can’t say someone else buying them is surprising and I don’t doubt this is the final nail for Palia<br><br>Comment by Ic3b3rgS on 2024-07-03 [+7 votes]:<br>Palia failed as a game and failed their objectives. This is the confirmation. A few years of maintenance mode milking and then shutdown is my prediction.<br><br>Comment by le_Menace on 2024-07-02 [+8 votes]:<br>Daybreak might have the worst management in the industry, my god what a terrible decision.<br><br>Comment by kyleblane on 2024-07-02 [+3 votes]:<br>I'm dying to know how much they paid, and if it's less than the 50 million dollars Palia was developed for.<br><br>Comment by General-Oven-1523 on 2024-07-03 [+3 votes]:<br>Yikes, but this is probably their only option. Either sell the company or shut it down. The game failed on so many levels, and the developers seemed to be very cocky and ignorant of any constructive critisim around the game. They just wanted an positive echochamber.<br><br>Comment by Sand3rok on 2024-07-03 [+3 votes]:<br>Palia so boring, after 10-20h playing, its like other farm simulator, but the same Stardew Valley, being essentially a single-player game, is much more exciting and replayable than this \"MMO\"<br><br>Comment by skyshroud6 on 2024-07-02 [+6 votes]:<br>RIP<br><br>Comment by TheGladex on 2024-07-02 [+14 votes]:<br>I mean this game wasn't doing amazing in the first place but yikes<br><br>Comment by Starbound_Selly on 2024-07-02 [+4 votes]:<br>I remember when Daybreak shut down H1Z1 (Just Survive), the community was shattered. But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) <br><br>  <br>But they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company), at least.)<br><br>I've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.<br><br>  <br>1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.<br><br>2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)<br><br>  <br>For now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.<br><br>Comment by _RrezZ_ on 2024-07-02 [+6 votes]:<br>Lmao Daybreak lost all hope of me ever touching anything related to them the day they took my $200 for Landmark and then cancelled the entire project.<br><br>Was also the last time I ever bought a founders edition or similar from a game company.<br><br>Comment by PiperPui on 2024-07-02 [+3 votes]:<br>Garbage game being picked up by an mmo graveyard, no surprise.<br><br>Comment by Jakerkun on 2024-07-02 [+2 votes]:<br>looking how  trash this game was...<br><br>Comment by moosecatlol on 2024-07-02 [+1 votes]:<br>RIP I guess.<br><br>Comment by StarSyth on 2024-07-02 [+1 votes]:<br>RIP Palia<br><br>Comment by mikegoblin on 2024-07-02 [+1 votes]:<br>I’m curious what intellectual property they had that made this a smart move.
