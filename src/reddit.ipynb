       " '**TL;DR- $20 got me an awesome appointment with a nice doctor and a prescription for a medication I could afford that solved my issue.**\\n\\n*Disclaimer: This particular thing worked well for me so I\\'m going to tell you about it. Everyone is different, so it might not work as well (or at all) for you.  Take what you find useful from this post and ignore the rest.  I\\'m not compensated or connected to the website I\\'m discussing.*\\n\\nSo like a lot of people on here I\\'m usually either uninsured or underinsured.  Right now it\\'s underinsured with a high deductible, so when I messed my back up badly enough that I could barely move I freaked.  I\\'ve got scoliosis, a fucked up spine, bad knees, and muscles that love to spasm uncontrollably for days on end.  I\\'d run out of my prescription muscle relaxants last fall and hadn\\'t been able to afford another appointment.  Advil helps a little but it wears off in 4 hours so I kept waking up in pain, and for some reason Aleve has never worked for me.  Just doesn\\'t, it\\'s weird.\\n\\nSo I was fucked.  Can\\'t sleep, hurts like crazy, still gotta work.  Fuck.  Can\\'t afford the $100+ for a doctor\\'s appointment, plus taking the day off to get into the next town over where there\\'s a walk in clinic that can take me on short notice.  Fuck fuck.  Bad.\\n\\nSo I drank several glasses of wine and started googling \"how to get a prescription online.\"  There are some pretty sketchy (and expensive) options that I am pretty sure are hella illegal, and then I see a result for [98point6.com](https://98point6.com).  It\\'s $20 for a one year membership with unlimited online appointments ($120 for the second year unless I cancel before then).  Fuck it, I\\'m drunk enough to sleep tonight, if I\\'m still in bad shape tomorrow morning it\\'s worth a try.  I was still in bad shape the next morning, so I did it.\\n\\nGuys, it was amazing.  It\\'s not perfect, obviously- you need an internet connection and either a phone or  computer with webcam.  I chatted with some weird robot for 10 minutes or so and answered questions about what my problem was, then I got connected to this nice doctor lady and we talked over the webcam for... 10 minutes maybe?   about what was going on, what I\\'d already tried, what I knew from my own medical history likely wouldn\\'t help.  She was so kind, and didn\\'t make me feel dumb or worthless for not being able to afford a full price doctor\\'s appointment in my town.  She said that even people who do have a local PCP use their service because it\\'s faster and cheaper and easier than an office visit.  (One limitation of internet medicine is that they can\\'t prescribe controlled substances, or medications with high potential for abuse which apparently includes the muscle relaxant I usually took.)   She recommended a prescription anti-inflammatory that lasts for 12 hours, since the muscle relaxant I\\'d taken in the past wasn\\'t an option to have prescribed over the internet. And then I said the thing I hate saying- \"This sounds like a good option, but cost is a big issue for me.  What\\'s the usual price of this med out of pocket?\"\\n\\nUsually when I ask that the doctor says something shitty like \"well it\\'s what I normally prescribe for someone in your situation, the cost you\\'ll pay varies based on the pharmacy and your insurance. Unfortunately I can\\'t estimate your cost.\"  This lady did not.\\n\\nThis amazing awesome doctor picked up her iPhone and said \"I have an app for a website called GoodRx, if you give me your zip code I\\'ll let you know what this will cost at the pharmacies in your area using their discount program. If this medication is out of your price range there are a few other things that would work just as well and might be more affordable.\"  She didn\\'t shame me for being poor, she was actively prepared to address the needs of people who have limited funds, and she was willing to spend her time to find a medication I could afford.  Happily, the med she prescribed was under $15 for a 1 month supply through GoodRx, hooray!  (I know that\\'s a lot for some people, but it was doable for me.)\\n\\nI would 100% use 98point6 again, especially since my $20 gets me unlimited visits for a year.  It\\'s not the right place to go for a broken arm, but for prescription anti-inflammatories or antibiotics for your 3rd UTI of the year or something pretty basic it\\'s a good low cost option.   And not having to leave the house to talk to a doctor was really really great.\\n\\nIf anyone else has recommendations or critiques or thoughts on internet medicine stuff I\\'d love to hear it.')"

Hope it’s useful. by annetteisshort on 2020-01-08 [+3281 votes]:<br>You guys left so many awesome resources throughout the comments of the last post, so I thought I’d consolidate the info into an easier to read list for whoever might need it. I went ahead and looked up each service to verify they are legit, and listed the basic details of each one. <br><br>As always, shop around. Depending on what you need, some services may be cheaper than others.<br><br><br>**—** Digital Doctor Services **—**<br><br>**K Health**<br><br>*        $14 for one appointment with 2 weeks open for questions and follow-up.<br>*        $39 per year for unlimited appointments. <br>*        Subscription not required for the $14 appointments. <br>*        You can get labs and prescriptions.<br>*        Can use with or without insurance.<br>*        Monthly subscription service for anxiety/depression with benefits of normal yearly subscription + mental health specific consultations, treatment plans, referrals, and monthly medication delivery. Must consult app to sign up and get approved for this particular service.<br><br><br>**HeyDoctor**<br>       <br>*        $20 for most appointments, though costs can vary depending on what you need an appointment for. Most typical appointments are $20, but check the website for all prices.<br>*        You can get labs and prescriptions <br>*        Can use with or without insurance.<br> <br><br>*The prices of the next two digital doctor services are extremely comparable to typical cash prices for seeing a regular doctor. Not all that budget friendly in my opinion, but I’ll list them and their prices since they were in the comment section of the previous post.*<br><br><br>**Teladoc**  <br><br>*        $49 or less for typical doctor consultations.<br>*        $75 or less for Dermatology consultations<br>*        $80 per visit for licensed Therapist.<br>*        $95-$200 per visit with licensed Psychiatrist.<br>*        Can provide prescriptions.<br><br><br>**Doctor on Demand**<br><br>*        $75 for 15 minute consultation with doctor.<br>*        $129-$179 for 25-50 minute consultation with psychologist. <br>*        $299 for 45 minute consultation with Psychiatrist.<br>*        $129 for 15 minute follow-up with psychiatrist.<br>*        Consultations can be extended for additional fees.<br>*        Prices above are cash prices, but this service also accepts insurance.<br>*        Can provide prescriptions.<br><br><br>*In addition to the services listed above, you should also consult your insurance, if you have any, to see what telehealth services they might offer. You may already be paying for this type of service in your insurance package.*<br><br><br>**—** Migraine Only **—**<br><br>**Cove**<br><br>*        $4 monthly subscription fee.<br>*        Migraine-specific help.<br>*        Not for other medical issues.<br>*        Can get prescriptions.<br><br><br>**—** In-Person Medical Help **—**<br><br>**Planned Parenthood**<br><br>*        Discounted and free services for sexual health, birth control, routine testing, pregnancy, and more. <br><br>**FQHC Clinics**<br><br>*        I couldn’t find too much about this, other than that it is considered a low-cost health service. It’s worth a try to look it up and what might be available where you live.<br><br>**Cash Discounts**<br><br>*        Some doctors accept a discounted cash payment for treatment, so shop around where you live to see what options might be available to you.<br><br>**Local Health Districts**<br><br>*        You can get low cost or free vaccinations at local health districts. <br>*        Also ask them about other preventative vaccines, like HPV and Flu Shots. It doesn’t hurt to check if your town/city offers free or discounted preventative vaccines.<br><br><br>**—** Medication Discounts **—**<br><br>**GoodRX**<br><br>*        Medication discount up to 80%.<br>*        Lists the after-discount cost of all local pharmacies, as some are cheaper than others.<br>*        Use discount coupons when you pick up your prescriptions from your pharmacy.<br>*        Will call your pharmacy for you if they initially refuse to accept it, or don’t understand what it is.<br>*        Free service. No subscription needed.<br><br>**Blink Health**<br><br>*        Buy online and pick up medications at your pharmacy, or have them delivered.<br>*        Free delivery.<br>*        Can get consult with doctor if you don’t currently have a prescription.<br>*        Free service, no subscription needed.<br>*        See their website for a list of participating pharmacies.<br>*        Can request refills, transfer prescriptions, and consult a licensed pharmacist with any questions.<br><br>**Manufacturer’s Website**<br><br>*        Every medication manufacturer may offer huge discounts on their medications on their own websites.<br><br>**Grocery store discount programs**<br><br>*        Your local grocery stores, including Walmart, likely have prescription discount plans, so make sure to ask your pharmacy about theirs!<br>*        Typically it’s a yearly fee to sign up for these services. For instance, at Kroger it is $36/year. <br><br>**Honeybee Health**<br><br>*        Online discount pharmacy.<br>*        No insurance accepted.<br>*        Free Delivery.<br>*        Offers medications at wholesale prices.<br><br>**Pharmacychecker**<br><br>*        Price comparison service for online pharmacies.<br>*        Free to use.<br>*        Does not provide medications, just helps you compare prices.<br><br>**The Pill Club**<br><br>*        Birth Control Only.<br>*        $0 medication with most insurance.<br>*        $15 consultation fee + cost of medication with no insurance, or if out of market insurance.<br>*        Free medication delivery with a few feminine goodies.<br><br>**Nurx**<br><br>*        Sexual Health only.<br>*        $15 consultation fees for each various service. The $15 consultation fees cannot be billed to insurance.<br>*        $0 typically for birth control through insurance.<br>*        As low as $15 per month for birth control without insurance.<br>*        Testing prices vary depending on the test and if you do or do not have insurance. Consult their FAQ page for detailed test prices.<br>*        Medications can be billed to insurance.<br>*        Provides sexual health medications, including birth control and Plan B.<br>*        Provides home testing kits for sexual-related illness such as STI testing and HPV screening.<br>*        Can also order lab testing if preferred over home testing.<br><br>**Simple Health**<br><br>*        Birth Control Only.<br>*        $0 prescription with most insurance.<br>*        $20 annual fee for the care package, includes initial consultation with doctor.<br>*        As low as $15 per month prescription cost with no insurance.<br>*        Free shipping.<br>*        Automatic Refills.<br><br><br>**—** Prescription Skin Care **—**<br><br>**Curology**<br><br>*        $19.95 per month, plus shipping.<br>*        Includes ability to talk to provider<br>*        Includes customized skin care formula.<br>*        Includes cleanser and moisturizer.<br>*        Includes 2 minute skincare routine to follow with the above products.<br><br><br>With any prescription that is more than you’re able to afford, you should also ask your pharmacist about alternative options, as they likely know something cheaper, or they can point out an over-the-counter medication or supplement that can help in the meantime if you can’t afford a doctor. I’ve personally had my pharmacist show me what over the counter medications would help with anxiety medication withdrawal that happens with certain anxiety and depression medications when you stop taking it. They helped me pick a vitamin that would help keep the anxiety at bay a bit so I didn’t have a complete breakdown while waiting for more meds. Pharmacists are a fantastic resource, and they’re happy to help.<br><br>Also, try applying for free healthcare. It is available for people in hardship, and there is no shame in getting help from the government when you need it. It doesn’t hurt to just see if you qualify. I’ve used it before, and it can help relieve a little of the stress from poverty to at least know you’re covered if something happens. <br><br>Thanks everyone for all your input on the previous post.

You have truly helped me more than you could know by posting this. I've been worrying and fretting over seeing a mental health professional for over a year because every place I've called and looked into is a minimum $150-$200 just for a consult/diagnosis, and I simply do not have that kind of money to spend after monthly bills and what have you, even with my insurance I have to meet a deductible before I get any coverage for the services I need. I've been battling with worsening anxiety and symptoms of adult ADHD, and have felt nothing short of hopeless about it. But now I've just signed up for K Health and am currently waiting to speak to a doctor now, all at an *affordable* price.<br><br>OP, you're a rockstar. Thank you *thank you.* And thank you to everyone who contributed to this amazing list!<br><br>&#x200B;<br><br>Edit/update: after filling in my info, waited \\~25 mins for a doctor to speak to me. Did a 2 minute meet via video call, then went back to chat where he diagnosed me officially and is now sending medication to try right to my door. I can reach out any time for help or with questions, and he will follow up in a couple weeks. I'm in awe how easy this was, and the relief of not having to worry how I'll afford this is overwhelming. Give this a try if needed, folks! Good luck to you all!<br><br>Edit 2: Sorry, I should clarify I’m being sent anti-anxiety medication, not something for ADHD. The doctor could not prescribe me a controlled substance through the app but could diagnose and refer me to somebody in person who could. I hope this helps!<br><br>Comment by roses124 on 2020-01-08 [+76 votes]:<br>Chewsi is a free app that partners with dentists and gives discounted prices for different services. It is usually MUCH cheaper than what they will charge you if you go in without the app. A filling without the app at my dentist was over $300. With the app it's $182.

You pay a one time $59 fee to join, and then they subsidize the costs of your therapy appointments (if you see one of the providers listed on the website). Therapy appointments are $30-60 a session depending on the provider and your financial need. This is 1/3-1/2 of what you'd pay a therapist out of pocket without mental health insurance.<br><br>This is specifically for therapy, not psychiatry. A regular doctor can write a RX for psychiatric meds, you don't have to see an expensive psychiatrist for this.  So if you're wanting medication and therapy, go to a regular doctor for the meds, and use a low-cost therapy resource.<br><br>If you are on Medicaid or Medicare, community mental health agencies will give you free mental health therapy and usually free psychiatric medication also.<br><br>Comment by Vlad_Yemerashev on 2020-01-08 [+80 votes]:<br>Thank you for sharing this OP.

I used to manage the private practice for a psychiatrist. I dealt with insurance every day for 3 years. Still have a hard time navigating healthcare related stuff. And I didn’t know many of these resources. <br><br>Also, can confirm that going through the manufactures website is super helpful. You can find specific coupons and resources not available on GoodRx or through your pharmacy. I take Vyvanse for ADHD, which does not have a generic yet. With a coupon (without insurance) it costs almost $300 for a month supply. I found a program called Shire Cares (through the manufacture) that gives you a coupon to get Vyvanse (and some of their other meds) at no cost if you make less than around $80,000. It took around 3 months for it all to go through (they make it difficult for a reason), but I did end up getting it! As a grad student, this was a lifesaver.

When the recession hit the drug companies realized they’d go out of business if they didn’t provide copay assistance. They may be covering your $400 copay but they’re still squeezing $4500 a month out of your insurance company, so it’s still a gain for them. It’s twisted but that’s how it works.<br><br>Comment by catkeepsclimbing on 2020-01-08 [+14 votes]:<br>Wanted to add, as I recently used this service, Planned Parenthood has an app (PPDirect) that women can use for birth control and UTI antibiotic prescriptions that don’t necessarily require an in person visit (in 24 states and DC).<br><br>Since I’ve had UTIs before I knew the symptoms right way and just had to answer a few questions and was prescribed antibiotics within 2 hours. If your request is approved without needing a visit, it cost $25 for the consultation and for me it was $14.70 for the antibiotics (it was less than my insurance price of $15). <br><br>This was much cheaper than what my Obamacare insurance would have cost me ($30 visit + $149 for lab testing + $14.70 for antibiotics) as my primary care requires lab testing for UTI treatments. <br><br>This is a great service that I think more women should know about!<br><br>Comment by PeachyKeenest on 2020-01-08 [+11 votes]:<br>This should be sticked or put in a sidebar or something.

Also, I’ve updated one of my responses on the other post but Publix DOES accept GoodRX. If a pharmacy location rejects your discount card or coupon, it’s because the pharmacy manager or district manager is forcing everyone’s hand into not mentioning other discount programs or accepting said discounts, which is NOT okay. If this happens to you, immediately transfer your prescription(s) to a different pharmacy. If this is a regular occurrence at multiple pharmacies in a certain area, go to a different chain or if another city is close enough try one there. I’ve had this happen many times to me when I worked in that field and I feel like it’s totally unfair.<br><br>Another thing to note would be that if they reject your discount one time, it may not be the same another time. If they tell you their price for a prescription is cheaper than your GoodRX price, this is for a SCRIPT BY SCRIPT BASIS. If they tell you this and their price is cheaper it does NOT mean you can’t use GoodRX there for your other scripts that are cheaper via GoodRx or another site.<br><br>Also, a coupon is different from a discount/savings program. A coupon is something you can ONLY get from a manufacturer website (not all discounts from these sites are coupons though) or through your provider if said manufacturer has given them coupons, or sometimes through other programs. It is MANDATORY that these are accepted. An example of a coupon vs savings/discount would be that a coupon would state you can get x quantity for free, but a discount would just lower the cost. Coupons almost always make your prescription cheaper than savings/discount sites and must always be accepted.<br><br>Comment by ThePersnicketyBitch on 2020-01-08 [+9 votes]:<br>Just a suggested edit - Publix absolutely *does* take GoodRX!

Has anyone had experience getting the depo shot from any of the sites mentioned, I checked out the pill club but it doesn't have depo shot as an option which makes sense, but I didn't know if anyone else had any ideas? Also, has anyone had any experience with getting a yearly gynecology appointment without insurance?

Response-time and action was so fast, I thought it was a joke.
