In short, they only planned to monetize cosmetics, but they'd be up front about changes.  <br><br>Anyone that's played a Daybreak game can tell you that's not how they operate. Pay for convenience, pay to win, etc., whatever you want to call it, it's coming. When I messed with Palia briefly, it seemed like the most obvious cashgrab would be to sell wait time reduction on crafting or building objects.

But it was also filled with hackers (from the East, some in america.) <br><br>  <br>But they've also closed over 20 games in their time. (From 1997 to 2018 on the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Game_Company), at least.)<br><br>I've been into Palia for some time, threw a couple bucks into the game because I enjoyed supporting the Devs for the inital launch. But if Daybreak is as hands on as they usually are, this game is going to go one of two ways.<br><br>  <br>1. They stay mostly hands-off, allow S6 team to develop within healthy timeframes and put out content.<br><br>2. They grab unto the game with such force and forcefeed it more in store items (P2w items, convience items, premium pass,etc.)<br><br>  <br>For now? I can't say for sure, but I am biased in my examination of the situation as Daybreak has been horrible about alot of cashgrab things, not caring for titles, etc. Overall, I hope the S6 team does well enough to support their families and relatives. Because while these are game companies, there are people on the team who don't get a say in what happens.<br><br>Comment by LostMinimum8404 on 2024-07-02 [+14 votes]:<br>Palia was such a let down. The devs themselves were greedy and lazy and doubled down when called out about it (like adding a well requested thing behind a paywall) or instead of adding actual meaningful content they add costumes which sucked and were overpriced. Not even to get into the “mmo” aspect of the game.
