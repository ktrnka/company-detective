      "I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identify the main subject and objective: Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure that the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add context: Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier for you to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure specificity: Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use clear and concise language: Make sure that the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporate open-ended questions: If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid leading questions: Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide instructions when necessary: If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure the prompt length is appropriate: While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent any confusion or loss of focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a prompt rewriter, capable of refining and enhancing any given prompts to ensure they elicit the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT. Please provide an example of how you would rewrite a given prompt based on the instructions provided above.\n",

They all provide a more unique and detailed experience in their respective areas.\\n\\nFrom what I remember in testing - you\\'re basically handed a plot of land at the beginning after some quests and you can start building/questing to progress. But these plots of land were away from the main village tucked away and I thought it was an instanced zone you could see with others so they could recycle the same handful of plots.\\n\\nAnd at that point why not play Valheim or V Rising or Palworld or something where you can build anywhere, see roughly the same number of real players or none at all if you prefer solo.\\n\\nPalia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city.\\n\\nAnd I think Palia is kind of falling into that pitfall of assuming players will group up and make content on their own for pve. A tiny minority will. Pvp games the competition is the content. But pve you need to find a way to get people to work towards a common goal.\\n\\nAnyways just my rambling thoughts as someone who was optimistic, tried it out and got turned off. Sucks people are getting fired. Wish them well.\\n\\n### Comment kyns6av by No_Dig903 on 2024-04-08 [+25 votes] (in reply to kyn4d7g):\\nMate, former \\\\*big company\\\\* generally means they\\'re slaves to gridlock, whether or not they know it.\\n\\nWhat you want is some scrappy bastard from a small MMO studio that had to wear a lot of hats. It\\'s why you see old LOTRO company devs doing shit like leading Stellaris development.\\n\\n#### Comment l72qa3f by Nik_wilks on 2024-06-04 [+1 votes] (in reply to kyns6av):\\nyea not true. These are people not robots. its just previous experience. Small has nothing to do with it. its who your stakeholders and publishers are. small or big, they can be as you put it gridlock. for god sakes we just saw CONCORD. small developer with a big publisher making another overwatch copy instead of a innovative game. Your brain dead comments is how i know your were never in the game industry. Just more speculation by a loser who wants everyone to think they are an expert. please take your trash comments elsewhere. We dont put you into a category just because you work at Mcdonalds or Walmart do we? is that not a gridlock as well? working 9 -5 for scaps? yea, that\\'s what i thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyppu7o by NoWordCount on 2024-04-09 [+8 votes] (in reply to kyn4d7g):\\nHonestly? I enjoy the characters and setting.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t downvote me for liking it. 😥\\n\\nI have ADHD. I struggle with a lot of crafting and survival game because I can never remember the resources I need, and I always feel like I\\'m falling behind. I\\'m into a lot of high-execution games... but open world survival games generally just leave me feeling mentally exhausted.\\n\\nThe limited resources and the generally simple routes to obtain them is something that my broken brain can handle without feeling overwhelmed.\\n\\nMany of the criticisms against Palia made hard are entirely valid. But I find the depth of the characters and the story they\\'re involved in honestly really well written and compelling to engage with. Enough so that it keeps me wanting to come back regularly to learn more about them, despite the basic gameplay loop.\\n\\n#### Comment kypy0pe by SvenWollinger on 2024-04-09 [+2 votes] (in reply to kyppu7o):\\nThe story and characters are great, if you like those kind of stories.\\nFor me (both queer and neurodivergent) it was heaven. I remember the announcement trailer and praying itll come out one day.\\nI did have a great time for about 4 weeks, since repetitive tasks dont quite stop me from having fun.\\nWhat ultimately killed my vibe was when the bug happend to me that randomizes your characters appearance and voice (back then you couldnt change voice).\\nIve known people who didnt want to play their characters anymore for dysphoria, and i also lost interest because my character sounded too silly lol.\\nIts a game all about looks. How the npcs look, your character, your house..\\nHow they took multiple months to add a damn voice setting is beyond me.\\nAnd thats my issues, it is so obvious that the devs were not cut out for this.\\n\\nThe story and art are fine and great for the right kind of player.\\nBut the technical side of the game is an absolute mess.\\nSadly :(\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyn2w40 by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-08 [+106 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPlayed it back when it was EA... for one day. I like cozy games, i don\\'t need always high stakes... but the gameplay loop was so insanely boring, only two zones and max. 24 other Players with you on one map. The Story was generic and kinda uninspired. The Crafting was boring... and also the whole game was not what they advertised.\\n\\nThe Server Structure back then was bad too. Don\\'t know if they fixed it. I can\\'t describe it better than, if you switched to the second zone or your home, you basically logged out one server and logged in on another server. Basically never meeting the same people again.\\n\\nEdit: Basically i\\'m amazed they made it that far.\\n\\n### Comment kyn3rho by Hexdro on 2024-04-08 [+18 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nTbh not entirely sure if they\\'ve really made it anywhere considering they\\'ve axed a third of their development team and the game is still in open beta/early access haha.\\n\\n#### Comment kyn4vn3 by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-08 [+1 votes] (in reply to kyn3rho):\\nYeah... well, you\\'re right. Back then i said, i would be surprised if we\\'re talking about Palia in 2024. So, yeah i\\'m a bit surprised that this happens now and not last year.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyn38r2 by Slow_to_notice on 2024-04-08 [+12 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nYeah it really dampened the idea of meeting people when as you said you were constantly swapping between rooms.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kynpxxg by tsukaimeLoL on 2024-04-08 [+11 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\n> Edit: Basically i\\'m amazed they made it that far.\\n\\nIts just still a bit disappointing to me that this took 6 years to make by some developers I thought really had potential\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyxpc4q by Specialist_Flamingo5 on 2024-04-10 [+3 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nI agree 100 percent i played in Beta and I was hoping for new zones added or at least new questing hubs, there are tons of areas just wasting space and for cozy game enthusiast the crafting just isn\\'t there. No paths for your lot, your house is very limited in what you can place in it. I had such high hopes and just no advancement in the past year.\\n\\n#### Comment kyzd67q by Labskaus77 on 2024-04-10 [+2 votes] (in reply to kyxpc4q):\\nYeah, this game is just lots of wasted potential.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyqp909 by Zarod89 on 2024-04-09 [+5 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nThey took out all the interesting stuff out of an mmo and you are left with Palia. When pruning goes too far\\n\\nIf people just want to sit around a campfire and talk to eachother, they can play any other mmo with an actual large world and more RP/cosmetic options. Palia is more like a small lobby with limited options.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyolz74 by -D-S-T- on 2024-04-08 [+4 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nYeah the gameplay loop was so boring, i left.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kypbs07 by Lraund on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nYou need other players to cut some trees and hate other players for existing for mining nodes. Doesn\\'t take to much to advance pretty far where you don\\'t have much to do except farm money to customize your house cosmetically.\\n\\nUnless stuff has changed since or I missed something when I played it.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kyqnejn by Digitijs on 2024-04-09 [+2 votes] (in reply to kyn2w40):\\nFelt like some wannabe 3d mmo Stardew Valley made by people who have never made nor played games\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyn0ulm by Hexdro on 2024-04-08 [+120 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPalia isn\\'t quite an \"MMO\" but it\\'s still news. The developers have axed around 35% of its staff (49 people or so) which includes people from all areas of the team - from narrative writing to character design, environment artist and engineers. This news along with the mixed reception from the Steam launch, keeping the fact that the game is in \\'beta\\', etc - the future of the game is worrying tbh.\\n\\n### Comment kyn1g5o by GuiltyExcitement7952 on 2024-04-08 [+25 votes] (in reply to kyn0ulm):\\nwhat future? is palia a live service game?\\n\\n#### Comment kyn1twe by Hexdro on 2024-04-08 [+52 votes] (in reply to kyn1g5o):\\nIt\\'s currently in open beta, but yes it was planned to be a live service \"MMO\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Comment kyshhir by Independent_Hyena495 on 2024-04-09 [+1 votes] (in reply to kyn1g5o):\\nIt was lol\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kynh7xz by Bombg on 2024-04-08 [+8 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPlayed the game for a while when it went open beta. Love the game, but ran out of things to do. Also the shop cosmetics in this game are ugly as hell, so nothing ever tempted me to spend money.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyn75n0 by MyStationIsAbandoned on 2024-04-08 [+23 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nAnyone whose into these types of games, don\\'t bother. I played for about a month or two when it went to open beta\\n\\nThe studio doesn\\'t seem to know what it\\'s doing or they\\'re just trying to go after whales. They made it clear that you will *never* be able to unlock new outfits with out paying real life money for it despite having a clothing shop in game...which just brought you to the cash shop...\\n\\nWhen I played the game only had two tiny maps you could run around. The gameplay loop of the game gets old really fast.\\n\\nThere\\'s no trading between players other than a goofy gifting system where you can give people stuff exchange for 1 point of something you need 100 of to do anything with, which you can get more of talking to the NPC\\'s.\\n\\nThe game should have been $20, single player, with a focus on the story since that\\'s exactly how it plays. You talk to the NPCs and can romance some of them or all of them and do their personal story as well as a main quest/storyline. There\\'s literally no reason for this game to be online only other than the fact that they want to sell you $30 outfits with extremely limited colors.\\n\\nAnd as for the time i was playing the only way to get a pet was to spend a bunch of money in the cash shop.\\n\\nThe people who made the story and characters are talented. But whoever is running the show over does not know what they\\'re doing. It\\'s like they looked at what mobile games do and thought it would translate to PC or something.\\n\\n### Comment kyo0uss by Crashen17 on 2024-04-08 [+11 votes] (in reply to kyn75n0):\\nReminds me of Wagadu Chronicles and all the other more... out of the box \"mmos\" that have come out over the past couple years. Someone, somewhere, had a unique idea, story, setting and said \"lets sell this to people and let them play it\" but they were too busy coloring outside of the lines (which can be genius) to actually *make a fucking game anyone wanted to play*.\\n\\nThey were more intent on originality and creativity than actual gameplay design. Which is a shame, because to really *change the narrative* you need both. Want to make a cozy non-violent life sim mmorpg redefine the genre? Make it fun, engaging and worthwhile. Make a good game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyo8b3x by Legitimate_Crew5463 on 2024-04-08 [+5 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nI was interested in this game for quite a while as was one of my friends. We were so disappointed in how small scale the multiplayer is. Makes me sad. The game did remind me of FreeRealms a bit and I was hoping for that. Instead we got a 24 player shared instance that hardly rewards and instead punishes multiplayer. It\\'s laughable how pointless it is. I do not know what they were thinking.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kynlt18 by KitsuneKamiSama on 2024-04-08 [+12 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nOpened it and saw most of the customisation options were monetised and that I had little visual progression otherwise. Stopped playing after an hour.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kynpur9 by Educational_Shoober on 2024-04-08 [+11 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nThe problem I had with it is with a cozy game, cosmetic microtransactions are basically P2W because the whole experience is more cosmetic in nature.\\n\\n### Comment kyy762x by kyleblane on 2024-04-10 [+2 votes] (in reply to kynpur9):\\nThis. So many fans love to boast that Palia is not pay to win. The problem with that statement is there is no way for another player to gain a mechanical advantage over another, so the typical “pay to win” scenario doesn’t exist in the first place. The only advantage that exists is a social-advantage.\\n\\nWant to look cool like that player? That’ll cost $30.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Comment kz38ezj by PlasmaJohn on 2024-04-11 [+1 votes] (in reply to kynpur9):\\n> microtransactions \\n\\nThere is nothing \"micro\" about their cash shop. \\n\\nLike others pointed out the outfits they were trying to sell weren\\'t all that appealing to begin with and that\\'s ignoring the lack of dye customization.  There were one or two that I *might* have caved at us$1 but for 15+?  hard. no.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kynm4qx by iluserion on 2024-04-08 [+5 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPailia Fail\\n\\n### Comment kyom6mp by -D-S-T- on 2024-04-08 [+6 votes] (in reply to kynm4qx):\\nFailia\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyofz0w by Barraind on 2024-04-08 [+6 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nSounds like a bleak future, but it was a bleak past and a bleak present for that title, so its not overly surprising.\\n\\nThey regularly undershot and underperformed at every turn.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyopd6e by Randomnesse on 2024-04-08 [+4 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nAfter watching multiple gameplay streams I am not surprised. It does **nothing** new or unique in terms of gameplay. All it has is a somewhat unique art style, and even that will absolutely repulse many potential players who prefer to have player characters with more details and more \"not just a plain, generic human\" race options.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kynw6ps by Crashen17 on 2024-04-08 [+8 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nYou can be as starry eyed and full of hopr, optimism and positivity as you want. If your game isn\\'t *fun* it\\'s going to fail. Palia is the equivalent of \"Thoughts and Prayers\".

It needed much more time to cook\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kypy7zu by Jogipog on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPalia was supposed to be this chill game where you had your little neighbourhood consisting of a mix of NPCs and houses of your friends. You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. \\n\\nNot to mention the insane lack of any content really. It was okay-ish for a beta but it had no business being 50gb for what it is either. They didn’t even show you how big the game was back then, only said „This is your download speed“ with a bar that slowly filled up. \\n\\nOverall a absolute disappointment for anyone who’s been following the game since its announcement back in like 2018(?).\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyqhodd by payne6 on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nUnfortunately it doesn\\'t surprise me at all. The game\\'s foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can\\'t even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \\n\\nHonestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn\\'t hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn\\'t wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \\n\\nAlso on top of all that the game really doesn\\'t have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can\\'t tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \\n\\nI never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn\\'t even mention their microtransactions don\\'t bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Comment kyqoaxk by Slaghton on 2024-04-09 [+3 votes] (in reply to 1bz2e0z):\\nPretty sure they received more than enough money to finish the game but likely squandered it somehow.

You were supposed to be able to just walk over to their house and help them with their crops, cook with or for them and go on expedition type adventures without combat with them. I was incredibly hyped about it and let down even harder once I got into the closed Beta. No neighbourhoods, no exciting cooking or farming and the adventures where apparently axed from the roadmap in absolute silence. Instead we got a barely working, hardly running over 15 fps, loadingscreen simulator that looked like a 2012 phone game with some of the worst animations I‘ve ever seen. \n",

      "Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me at all. The game's foundations are 100% amazing. The mining, the hunting, the way you can place furniture and items, even the character designs are great. The issue is the game is lacking that cozy game grind and locked to a central server for absolutely no reason. There is no reason at all Palia is a MMO. You can't even see other players on your farm/housing plot unless you invite them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly if anything the MMO aspects ruin the game. When you get to late game (which isn't hard I played the  game on and off super casually and got there very quickly) the only way to get rare wood is waiting for a event where certain trees glow and you need other players to help chop them down because they regenerate health. The issue is the playerbase would absolutely be insufferable about this event either you waited too long or you didn't wait long enough and you are a \"selfish spoiled gamer nice community palia REPORTED.\"Even now the subreddit has hissy fits with each other over this event about proper etiquette. To get rare ore you need to find certain spots and hope they respawn and then either take it or tag it like a MMO mob and wait for other players to tag the ore so everyone gets some. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also on top of all that the game really doesn't have any huge updates since it launched in EA last year.  The fact you still can't tame animals is insane to me because cooking is super important and you will always be running to get milk and eggs while we see chickens and cow like creatures in the game itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw a game so mismanaged from top to bottom. I legit think if the game was built from the ground up as a single player game with co-op and they added more things to do (taming animals, exploring, more ores, more trees, less grinding your level to get some  cosmetics) it would have been a huge success. Also I didn't even mention their microtransactions don't bother with them they are just costumes or skin swaps for your glider and are massively over priced $30 for a skin is insane especially since there is little to do with the community besides the wood event.\n",
