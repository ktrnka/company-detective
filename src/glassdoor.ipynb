      "\n",

      "### Growth Opportunities\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",
      "- Many reviews highlight opportunities for personal and professional growth, with supportive leadership and a mission-driven environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- The fast-paced startup culture may not suit everyone, and some employees may find the lack of structure challenging.\n",
      "\n",

      "- \"Lots of room to define your role.\" (Medical Intern on 2021-05-04)\n",

      "\n",
      "## Company Changes Over Time\n",
      "The reviews suggest a mixed evolution. Initially, the company was praised for its leadership and mission-driven culture, but as it grew, issues with leadership dynamics, particularly regarding trust and inclusivity, have surfaced. The presence of toxic behaviors and a lack of support for certain employee groups have become more pronounced.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Relationship Between Job Functions and Employee Satisfaction\n",
      "Employee satisfaction appears to vary significantly by job function. Technical roles, such as software engineering and data science, often report positive experiences, while roles in talent acquisition and operations express dissatisfaction with management and support. This suggests that satisfaction may be closely tied to the effectiveness of leadership and the nature of the work environment within specific teams.\n",
      "\n",
