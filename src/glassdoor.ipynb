      "  \n",
      "**Cons:**\n",

      "- Frequent changes in leadership and strategy have led to instability and low morale (e.g., \"Exec team doesn't seem to have long term strategy\" (Software Engineer on 2024-01-17)).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compensation and Benefits\n",
      "**Pros:**\n",

      "  \n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
      "- Compensation is frequently described as low, especially for the workload expected (e.g., \"extremely weak pay\" (Anonymous on 2022-03-13)).\n",

      "  \n",
      "**Cons:**\n",
