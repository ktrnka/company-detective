      <p>While it'll manage the basic tasks (replying, liking, updating message feeds) that's basically it. Responding is even a little off. You cannot change the sentiment of messages through mobile, which is a huge delay on those that run reports regularly. The whole app needs to be worked on, and responsiveness needs to be fixed. That's the whole reason we pay money to access sprout social.</p>

      <p>We use it because we have to. I cannot change the replying account for Twitter on my tablet, the settings are entirely missing from the app and desktop doesn't work properly on mobile devices so you have to use this bare bones of an app to work away from office. In what world does "save" mean "send"? In Sprout it does and your message won't be saved but be SEND when you tap save. Desktop is okay but this app is so so so bad.</p>

      <p>This app isn't completely android friendly. There are still parts that are for Apple devices only. Example: Instagram videos that you have to pretty much post yourself because spout won't do it for you aren't supported on anything other than apple devices. Pain when your scheduling is for nothing. Very disappointed by that.</p>

      <p>Maybe one of the worst apps. If you can even get it to open, it will hang at doing even basic tasks. Sharing a photo can take multiple attempts to even upload, and on the off chance the app decides to work for a few minutes you can only attach one photo at a time. Even the keyboard seems broken when using this app. It's almost impossible to use this app for work and I end up emailing photos to myself to post via desktop.</p>

      <p>There’s a ton of bugs within the latest update. Kicks you out if you’re not in it constantly, then doesn’t open properly when you’re forced to log back in. Doesn’t tag/@ properly on desktop or mobile - you have to select one platform, tag/@, duplicate and tag/@ again. Repeat the same process until all platforms are done. Their suggested scheduling times don’t match the actual platforms suggested times, so you’re constantly wondering who’s the best: the actual platform who has real time data, or a subscription based application that your company is paying $$$$$ for. 
The reporting data doesn’t give you any more information than what you get for free with your business accounts on your FREE platforms. 
You’re paying money for a tiny bit of convenience. That’s it.</p>

- cannot see or access or post TikTok content from the app
- post editing ALWAYS glitches the app and makes it crash, the minute I hit the pencil to edit and try to do anything with the caption the app freezes
- large video files refuse to download to my phone, I consistently get the error “please make sure you have enough space” meanwhile I am able to download the exact same video file onto my phone from other sources 

Sprout has a lot of potential, but ultimately is so buggy and missing really obvious features that it’s hard to truly enjoy the product.</p>

In this day and age and the industry we’re in, you can’t have more functionality on desktop than the app and these many hiccups on the app when trying to schedule and make changes to the content calendar. We have to be mobile and have ease of use on the app and right now there isn’t as much usability as on desktop and trust that it will do what it needs to.</p>

Only one thing makes me salty, when there is a server error, sprout social will be unable to post my content, but it still will be removed from my queue. So I’ll have to remake the content.
But I’m sure it can be fixed in the future.</p>

      <p>This service is so annoying. As a social media marketer, I want to schedule posts and post things quickly. With all of the app and web failures that Sprout Social has, it makes it very hard to do my job. I keep using this service because there’s really nothing else like it at this time but they REALLY need to get the kinks figured out. I spend 15 minutes trying to post something from their app to only give up and airdrop it to myself...</p>

      <h4>Needs better notifications for Instagram video posting, 2 stars (Winfield007, Apple App Store, 2018-11-21)</h4>
      <p>Instagram publishing may be limited with video but the reminder notifications for posting them is far too limited. I’d like a suite of reminders. I’d like to set it as a bonafide alarm, send me a text and then give me a call if I’m 15 minutes late. Of course I’d like to be in control of them but this needs to be more robust. It’s really hard to remember to post at random times of the day. And my notifications sometimes don’t make themself apparent and go unnoticed. So I have to set additional alarms in my calendar to make it work. 

In my settings I set it to not go away unless I address the notification and that did not work.</p>

      <h4>Good, but issues posting to Facebook, 3 stars (FuManShoes, Apple App Store, 2018-10-28)</h4>
      <p>**Update: the link preview issue was solved by removing and reconnecting Google+. Apparently that is the metadata scraper Sprout needs for Facebook and LinkedIn. 

Overall this is a good app tied to a great social management platform, but for some reason I can't effectively share link posts to Facebook pages from the app. No link preview shows in the Sprout app and the resulting post just contains a link. I think there's a compatibility issue with another setting or app on my phone but can't figure it out and neither can Sprout support. Maybe app devs here can.</p>

      <h4>Decent, save for a few issues, 3 stars (Bethelly, Apple App Store, 2018-07-14)</h4>
      <p>I love Sprout, I do. I’ve been using it for about 5 years and it’s a powerful tool. The app works great with an older iPhone, but if you’re using the app with an iPhone X, expect the keyboard to cover the area where you would be able to type a response. It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it’s really frustrating.  

I also wanted to share a Customer Care experience. Usually Sprout’s CC is amazing but we had a really weird experience yesterday. We had to reset our password like 5 times to be able to login (again, specific to the app). I don’t know exactly what happened but the agent who was helping us continued to say there was nothing he could do to help, and that we were typing the password incorrectly. 

There is nothing more patronizing and frustrating to receive CC that assumes you and your 4 different employees with phones are all typing the password incorrectly when the login/pass worked all all of our MacBooks. When we pushed to log a bug, the agent said “there isn’t a history of these complaints so there was nothing I could do.” 

After like 5 app uninstalls/reinstalls with all of us logged out, we finally got back into our account. I just wish that this agent would have tried to listen rather than assume we are all a bunch of idiots. Nothing worse than: “did you try to turn it off and back on again” when your whole team works in IT/tech.</p>

      <p>Nice update overall. Seriously good job... but I'm running into several bugs or issues. 

1. App keeps crashing on iPhone 4S running latest ios7. 
2. I can't seem to select specific lists in my RSS feed anymore - I just get all
3. It won't remember my profile selections. So on each post I do from the app I must select all 7 profiles each time - though this may be related to my persistent random crashes 
4. No clear indicator which client group I'm on unless I look at the off screen nav or when I actually do a post (because I can see the profiles). But on the later I can't seem to change to another client group from the message screen?

All little bugs that I'm sure will be addressed. Again though, a nice update overall.</p>

Can't imagine life with out this now. We are able to manage pages for two companies and catch people tweeting about or companies with their keyword search tools.

      <p>i am a $99/month subscriber to sprout social. i love its functionality, ease of use and reporting. i use it daily. hell, i use it hourly.

their web-based program is top-notch. no complaints.

but this app, boy, oh, boy. that's another story.

let me start with the positive. great design and interface. on the surface, it's a gem.

then you start using it. crash. then you reboot it. crash. then you use it some more. crash.

i bet i have to close the app and restart it (not exaggerating) 10 times a day. 

yes, i have deleted and reinstalled time and again. and, yes, it crashes on both my ipad mini and iphone 4s.

i've shared this with the very attentive and receptive team at sprout support for months. they thank me for my feedback, but nothing has (yet) changed.

like i said, i love sprout. it's the social media management tool i choose to use above all others. but the constant app crashing has me rethinking the $99 i am sending them each month.

if they get this issue repaired, i will write a new, five-star review!</p>

I would give it 5+ stars for an intuitive iPad interface vs the phone version.  The whole reason I bought an iPad in the first place is to get a larger more intuitive screen for my business. It's hard to operate with clients when using the iPhone screen.  So please look at up sizing!</p>

      <h4>Very intuitive!, 5 stars (SOVI3T5PY, Apple App Store, 2012-05-30)</h4>
      <p>There's a few bugs, but I'm sure they're working on it. We're still evaluating for the 30 day trial period. Twitter data doesn't compile unless you have (x) amount of visitors (we have 9). The discovery feature is great, especially the smartsearch, but we hope you have FB capable of the 'Near this place' - Keep up the good work!</p>

      <h4>App is wonderfully thought out., 5 stars (Tanner Campbell, Apple App Store, 2012-03-24)</h4>
      <p>The guy below me is a tool.  You want Freemium, go to Hootsuite and get Freemium quality.  This a is not only beautifully fluid, but very well thought out.  You can assign and manage tasks, and do just about everything else you can do on the web dashboard, right within this app.  The sprout service is amazing; worth the money in every way.  For you smaller guys, check out the $10 pro plan on their website.  Sign up for the Sprout service and grab this app!!!</p>

      <p>Paying for social media management is a poor business model. You should at a minimum offer a freemiun service. This app is nothing but a pretty design, outside of that there's nothing I can't do on the Twitter and Facebook mobile apps that I can do with this app.</p>

      <h4>This application is as fantastic as the Sprout Social UI and service, 5 stars (NeuroNerd, Apple App Store, 2012-03-09)</h4>
      <p>I am a heavy user of SS in general but this app is really my right hand assistant. It schedules, it follows, it un-follows, it blocks, it reports spam, it DMs, it mentions multiple users, it replies..you get the picture. And the interface is just as user-friendly as the whole service experience and online site. You can't go wrong with SS or using this app.</p>

      <h4>Almost perfect...., 4 stars (Nicklesbr, Apple App Store, 2012-03-08)</h4>
      <p>Like the other reviewers say, this app is beautifully designed and it's a great compliment to the desktop version. The one problem I found, and for me it's a big one, is that the keyboard does not flip horizontal when you need to post a message or update. It's not something that's important on most apps, but for a app that will possible be used for a lot of typing, it's essential. Their competitors apps have this functionality and I hope sprout social adds this soon.</p>

      <h4>Best Twitter app (esp for people who manage several accounts), 5 stars (AlexKL, Apple App Store, 2011-11-09)</h4>
      <p>This app is so beautifully designed, just like the new SproutSocial 2.0 dashboard. It makes easier to manage multiple Twitter accounts, which is a feature I've been struggling with on every other Twitter app I've tried. One of my favorite features if the Tasks tab; I can see tasks that my team assigns to me, and vice versa. It also shows completed tasks, which is helpful. I like that it also lets you post to Facebook. I was surprised with the "Where are you?" feature that is very FourSquare-y; I haven't yet played with that but can see myself using it to give messages context. Again, this app is beautifully designed, which makes it even more enjoyable to use (for me).</p>
