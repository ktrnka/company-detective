      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <p>This is the worst HR company setup I've ever dealt with. They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage. If I wasn't forced to use this POS system for work I'd never, ever work with them again. I wish I could give zero stars.</p>

      <p>This app has gotten better over the years however it's still horrible, The biggest issue being that only the Admin for a company is allowed to give feedback on their app they don't take feedback from the people who actually use their product. Poorly coded, i.e. When selecting a state by pressing the letter t it brings up all the states with the letter t. And I really wish they would separate Job switching( Which I do multiple times a day) from state switching(which I rarely do).</p>

      <p>Poor user experience all-around. Slow load times, items that have been selected somehow never actually were when you go back into the app.... i.e. hitting "clock out" and going back hours later just to realize that it never actually clocked you out. Incorrect countdown times for breaks unless the app is closed out completely and opened fresh. The app simply refuses to work unless it is opened completely fresh every time. The design is fine, but the rest needs work, please.</p>

      <h4>Horrible Horrible Horrible, Get Gusto, 1 stars (ElectricMango, Apple App Store, 2024-02-18)</h4>
      <p>Hours need to be reentered 4+ times every entry because of how unintuitive this app is. Rippling is perhaps one of the worst UX apps i’ve ever encountered. It’s a dumpster fire, and the company doesn’t care to improve it. There is no way to contact them unless you are the CEO of the company you work for.. Entering in hours requires you to pick the date on the calendar every single time, because I guess it’s normal for people to work 40 Hours straight? This causes needing to double check dates constantly vs one glance at your schedule, such a pain. Add dark mode option, and make UI more intuitive. By default I have to use two factor authentication. Despite setting up Duo, I have to log in, and give a text verification code each time I want to access Rippling on desktop, I then get a security email saying I logged in.. There is no way to opt out of this, and it makes entering hours multiple times a week into a nightmare of stress. Gusto was so much better. In Gusto you get a payday email with how much you get paid. With Rippling it doesn’t say how much you got paid, you have to click on a link, go to the website, log in, enter a text verification code, go to your profile, then see your hours…..</p>

      <p>As I was laying in bed last night, I realized that the deadline for annual benefit enrollment was midnight, so I quickly stepped through the prompts so as not to lose ancillary benefits for the upcoming year. When I got to the life insurance benefit, I was surprised to see that my beneficiary was not listed, and I quickly entered the name and SSN. I then tapped the date field expecting to type a six (or eight) digit date. Instead, I found myself in a scrolling interface showing every day of the current month. Seeing that there was no way to bounce from year to year, I realized that I was faced with a test of endurance (and devotion to my wife)… swiping down, down, down, down… watching every day on my wife’s life flying by… muttering to myself, “Why do you have to be so old?” Halfway to the finish line, I started a screen recording on my phone. 2 1/2 minutes later, I arrived at 1981, asking myself, “How could some programmer have thought that five minutes of scrolling was a better solution than requiring a user to type six numbers on their keyboard?” Maybe there was too much room for error with that unvalidated approach🤓. Five minutes felt like an eternity. As the minutes passed, I felt every positive feeling I that I had about this otherwise good app melting away. Lucky for my wife, I stuck it out. Others, may not have been so fortunate.</p>

      <h4>Awful benefits software, 1 stars (syedhali, Apple App Store, 2023-07-21)</h4>
      <p>One star because payroll works, but wow this is the worst benefits software I’ve ever used. Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.

That’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. 

Rippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end. Come on rippling this isn’t a fun todo list app startup, it’s people’s lives. Put some humans on the phone…</p>

      <p>This company is poorly set up to actually do the basic thing it is meant to do- payroll. It does not automatically update rates nor do they check to make sure that the agency they are paying taxes to is correct. My (now ex) accountant set the system up, did not give me total access, and then the Rippling system did not actually look into verifying any information. The other issue we had was that taxes were not paid on time A LOT *or* to the wrong agency *or* (this one is impressive) to the wrong account. How is this company even legal?? On top of that nothing is intuitive on their platform- I don’t think the developers have ever actually ran payroll based on how this app is laid our. They are serving other payroll companies on a platter and tbh, just take the other option, this company is a disaster.</p>

      <p>Idk what the prod and eng departments are up to, but this app, which used to be so easy to use to log my work time and breaks, went through an update that makes this the clunkiest app on my phone. Every morning I try to open the app and I see the title screen but nothing more. I need to delete the app and re-download it. Then it requires me to log in with my email, password, and 2FA. These details load and then Rippling takes me BACK to a screen where I log in with my email, password, and 2FA. Pain in the neck every morning, and a huge time sink as I’m trying to log into work.</p>

1) brought the idea to me
2) got to know our needs and centered their case for our business around them

      <h4>Rippling Pile of Issues, 2 stars (WardWesley, Apple App Store, 2023-01-06)</h4>
      <p>For context I am CIO/CTO.  While Rippling is better than some of the competition, it is no better than NetSuite when it comes to QA of its underlying services.  

It is slow. It is clunky.  It is rife with big and little usability bugs. It constantly requires me to reset my password to use. It tries to do to much, and breaks into spaces such as OKTA is just flat out better at. 

It is has grown faster than its technology leaders can wrangle.  It was once the darling of the tech space, but no more. Get back to the basics and start executing well on a few things, than trying to everything less than well. 

I would seriously not consider Rippling in my role and capacity going forward till I see some serious attention paid to overall usability issues.</p>

Also, love how easy it is to enroll in benefits through the Rippling portal. Every week I get email reminders from Rippling as well… which helps when you are tied up with the workload.</p>

      <p>Rippling was a relatively new adoption at my current employer and I’ve never had onboarding be such a seamless process. What usually takes days wasted on the front end, Rippling facilitated and automated to happen in about an hour we’ll before my first day. 

Beyond onboarding, it provides so much clarity in knowledge from the planned holiday calendar to the organizational chart—both smoothed out “ripples” I otherwise thought were inescapable as an employee. Having PTO requests with clear counters of what PTO time and types I have left has also proven to streamline PTO request process and cut down on any confusion as year end comes.</p>

It seems every other time I open this, there’s a new update which is very annoying. Other than that having your work contacts at your finger tips is great and clocking in/out can be a little buggy but all and all is good. I just wish there wasn’t so many updates.

      <p>Have you ever been a new hire for a company and gone through numerous back & forth emails, drowning in doc attachments, and details of your employee benefits while still left dumbfounded? Yeah, we've all been there! When my previously workplace swapped from a competitor (strictly for paystub purposes) to Rippling, it was day and night! All the information I needed was finally organized in one space: directory/employee hierarchy, insurance, tax info, etc. This essentially eliminated the nightmares of going through old saved emails with personal information, lost in the grapevine translations, and moved towards a more streamlined process. Lastly, I enjoy the constant "reminders" of essentials I need to sign and authorize such as benefit deadlines. I cannot imagine going back to any other platform. I wished every workplace integrated rippling into their systems.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using rippling for onboarding and device management for over a year now and a couple of things stand out.

Integration: Deployment is very smooth in this platform and as a new company you get the basics, from software & antivirus deployment, to users management. The platform definitely makes it easy to get a user in, procure and assign a workstation with software and security on it.

Multi-use: The platform does a great job integrating HR tasks from employee onboarding to health benefits/open enrollment. It also does a good job integrating HR with IT tasks.

If you own a startup and are looking for something to get you going without pain and in one platform then Rippling is for you.</p>

      <h4>Difficult app, 3 stars (mrsuggestions, Apple App Store, 2022-08-25)</h4>
      <p>Difficult app on the end user side - some issues below:

1. The app works better on iphone than android

2. Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.

3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. 

4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.

5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. 

6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. 

7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so 
If you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?

8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up. Better to start the call off indicating how i know them and who and why i am calling.</p>

      <p>The new time entry update is not an improvement. It is cumbersome to have to select a date and time for every job change. It should at least auto populate to the current date to remove that extra step. Overall I like rippling but sometimes I don’t understand why the changes are made that are when there are so many other better changes that could have been made. Like, don’t fix it if it’s not broken kinda thing.</p>

      <p>As a first time user of Rippling with my new firm, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use along with the great interface/dashboard. 

We all know that new employee onboarding can be quite cumbersome and tedious, but with Rippling the process was expedited prior to my first day. It was simplified so that I was able to get right through and put my focus more on the work and tasks at hand of my new role.

I was able to accomplish all the paperwork and tasks in one place (one-stop shop), which for me was a very pleasant experience. No need to worry about finding important HR related documents because Rippling stores all that for the user to find and pull if needed down the line. 

Overall, impressed with the capabilities and functions.</p>

Instead, you must provide your credentials, switch to your two-factor authentication app, copy the code, then enter it in Rippling before the code expires. Way too many steps when FaceID could make it easier and more secure.</p>

      <p>I helped implement Rippling for my company and have been working as one of the main admins. It’s been challenging to get used to and get it all set up but each day we find little things that make our lives easier or that add excitement to already existing processes. I know there’s a lot we aren’t currently utilizing but hoping to get there with time. Rippling’s support is also exceptional. I always get a response even when using the chat feature. :)</p>

      <p>I went from a company that had Rippling, to a company who used ADP and let me tell you, I almost quit just trying to navigate ADP. It was so confusing and I had to email HR about ten times just to get 1 question answered about how to find info in there.

Cut to, I went back to the company who had Rippling and felt a sigh of relief. I onboarded in 5 minutes (no joke) and love how easy it is to find anything I need in there.

      <p>Just moved to Rippling and loving it so far. We came from a system that was not user friendly. You take time on the front end to set up the company infrastructure, but once you do, onboarding new team members is a breeze. Notifications are automatically sent to remind employees and admins when tasks are due. Rippling offers integrated solutions with many other partners which allows for greatly streamlined management of processes, especially for small and growing companies.</p>

As an employee, I experience it as super user friendly, yet it can do so much- payroll, benefits, ATS, etc. Just got my first paycheck notification and it was so fun, not archaic feeling!</p>

      <p>Rippling is perfect for a charity that wants to keep its overheads down, it’s employees happy and stay up to date with all its legal obligations. A very simple system for employer and employee. Even helped to find us a great 401k.</p>

      <p>Paystub breakdowns are very useful to know how much you've been deducted and for what reasons! I appreciate the clarity in all of that! Also, I always appreciate the fun little messages when you get paid 🥳 Rippling is simple to use, clear on the eyes, and very intuitive! Definitely a pick-up!</p>

      <p>The company I work for transitioned is to Rippling from Gusto and one of the best things about the switch is how easy the app is to use. 

You have just about all of your info on the main site available at your finger tips and I 100% feel confident using it from my phone. 

I highly suggest Rippling HR solutions for your HR needs as they have a strong user portal and app for you to use.</p>

      <p>The app is fine and does what it says, but that is only a portion of what we use rippling for. There are more features on the website that for some reason have not been included into the app. Insurance Benefits info, flex spending info, tasks, reports and birthdays/anniversaries all are missing. PTO requests work well and it gives easy access to paystubs but that is where the usefulness really ends for me, all the other features like password manager and company directory are covered by other apps I use regularly.</p>
