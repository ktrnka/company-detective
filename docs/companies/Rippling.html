      <p>Stop burning through my mobile data please! All of Rippling used 292 MB of mobile data in Sept and already used 160 MB in the first two weeks in October. How is that even possible? It makes no sense. I just use the app to punch and out at work and I'm on wifi most of the time. What ever data you're collecting over there, I'd like it to stop. At least have the decency to collect it when I'm on wifi. Not everyone has an unlimited data plan ya know.</p>

      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <p>This is the worst HR company setup I've ever dealt with. They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage. If I wasn't forced to use this POS system for work I'd never, ever work with them again. I wish I could give zero stars.</p>

      <p>This app doesn't work at all. I have contracting my hr and they can't figure it out and I contact ripple support and they say they don't help people that aren't customers. This company looks second hand. PAYLOCITY is way better!! I can't look up anything on the app. It's a water of money from my point of view. It log me in and as soon as I click on to go to my profile ot logs me out... don't do it it not worth any amount of money in my opinion. Even the name doesn't make sense!</p>

      <p>This app has gotten better over the years however it's still horrible, The biggest issue being that only the Admin for a company is allowed to give feedback on their app they don't take feedback from the people who actually use their product. Poorly coded, i.e. When selecting a state by pressing the letter t it brings up all the states with the letter t. And I really wish they would separate Job switching( Which I do multiple times a day) from state switching(which I rarely do).</p>

      <p>Poor user experience all-around. Slow load times, items that have been selected somehow never actually were when you go back into the app.... i.e. hitting "clock out" and going back hours later just to realize that it never actually clocked you out. Incorrect countdown times for breaks unless the app is closed out completely and opened fresh. The app simply refuses to work unless it is opened completely fresh every time.

      <p>Updated the app today, haven't tried to use it in a while but now it won't open. Tried to send a message to the customer service email address listed here under the contact info but received an immediate auto response explaining that they only respond to emails from employer accounts... That's pretty bad service. 🙄</p>

      <p>Doesn't load. Doesn't seem to work with Android 13. Been broken for months. By the time they fix it to work with android13, it'll break again when Android 14 comes out 4 months later (5/1), it still doesn't load in android 13.</p>

      <p>For like the 8th time and I'm not exaggerating, the update made it so I can't login at all. How does this happen so often? Why are you like this? How do you have a business? I honestly don't understand.</p>

      <h4>1 stars (Vera Ho, Google Play Store, 2023-04-12)</h4>
      <p>I use the app mostly to upload receipts to submit expenses and it's a pretty bad experience. It bugs out a lot trying to get to the Spend screen to even open the form to submit an expense. Recently it's been creating an extra draft for every expense that I have to go into the desktop site to delete. Today, the receipt scanner stopped working. After filling in the details manually and submitting, it "finishes" but just renders an empty form. And the entry isn't there. Please fix.</p>

      <p>Do you know I have to uninstall and reinstall this app every morning. When I open the app it takes me into Chrome version on the first login where I do a login and password with a two step verification (which does not give access to time clock), then I have to close it and reopen the app... do another login and password with a two step verification before it will even allow me to get to the time clock. I shouldn't have to do a 5 to 10 minute process to clock in to my work every day.</p>

      <p>Probably one of the worst apps I've ever had to use, it sometimes even refuses to open making me late to clock into work, it boots me back to the main menu when I try to clock in and I have to fight it for 5 minutes just to get in.</p>
