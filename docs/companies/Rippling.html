</ul>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Fundraising and Valuation</h2>
<p>Rippling's recent Series F funding round was led by Coatue, with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and new investor Dragoneer. The round included a significant secondary component, allowing early investors and employees to cash out some of their shares <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/">(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)</a>. This funding will be used to expand Rippling's market presence and enhance its research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, particularly in building new products <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer">(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)</a>.</p>
<h2>Expansion Plans</h2>
<p>Rippling is expanding its operations significantly, including a new 123,000-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco, which is the second-largest office lease signed in the city this year <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/tech-firm-office-space-downtown-sf-rippling-19385805.php">(D'Onfro, SFGATE, 2024-04-05)</a>. Additionally, the company is set to triple its footprint in New York City, creating 390 new jobs and investing $29 million in R&amp;D over the next decade <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan">(Governor Hochul, 2024-04-22)</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Information</h2>
<p>Rippling's platform is designed to automate and streamline various HR functions, including onboarding, payroll, benefits administration, and IT asset management. The system integrates with over 500 applications, providing a centralized source of truth for employee data <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/">(PYMNTS, 2024-04-22)</a>. The platform's core thesis is that maintaining accurate employee data across disconnected systems is crucial for business efficiency, and Rippling addresses this challenge by allowing changes to propagate automatically across all systems <a href="https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer">(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)</a>.</p>
<h3>Recent Changes to Product Offering</h3>
<p>In a notable strategic shift, Rippling has made its payroll module optional, a departure from its previous model where payroll was a required feature. This decision aligns Rippling more closely with enterprise software giants like Workday and SAP, which view payroll as a complementary offering rather than a core service <a href="https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024">(Outsail, 2024-04-22)</a>. This move may position Rippling for higher-margin growth but also raises questions about its differentiation in a competitive HR tech landscape <a href="https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024">(Outsail, 2024-04-22)</a>.</p>

      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <p>This is the worst HR company setup I've ever dealt with. They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage. If I wasn't forced to use this POS system for work I'd never, ever work with them again. I wish I could give zero stars.</p>

      <p>The fact that it tries to play FSA authority and denying eligible expenses is bs. Would encourage HR folks to find/use alternatives like Justworks or Gusto. Sure, Rippling is an "all-in-one", but it doesn't do 'all' of it well. Snafus with I-9 verifications and onboarding flows where you CAN'T opt out of certain offerings abound.</p>

      <p>This app has gotten better over the years however it's still horrible, The biggest issue being that only the Admin for a company is allowed to give feedback on their app they don't take feedback from the people who actually use their product. Poorly coded, i.e. When selecting a state by pressing the letter t it brings up all the states with the letter t. And I really wish they would separate Job switching( Which I do multiple times a day) from state switching(which I rarely do).</p>

      <p>Poor user experience all-around. Slow load times, items that have been selected somehow never actually were when you go back into the app.... i.e. hitting "clock out" and going back hours later just to realize that it never actually clocked you out. Incorrect countdown times for breaks unless the app is closed out completely and opened fresh. The app simply refuses to work unless it is opened completely fresh every time. The design is fine, but the rest needs work, please.</p>

App updates multiple times a week with no difference in performance. Freezes every clock in/clock out. Any positive reviews on here seem fake. As you can tell, Rippling doesn't respond to any reviews, just like they won't respond to any issues you have. Can't see paystub until payday. Worst payroll app I've ever used.</p>

      <p>Mostly good, but I really wish I could access the water-cooler on Rippling home from the mobile app. It's strange to me that the only way to access is via the extension and not the regular website or mobile app. I have other preferred new tab extensions and don't want to change that to access this feature.</p>

      <h4>5 stars (Lauren Ikerd, Google Play Store, 2023-02-10)</h4>
      <p>I logged into Rippling for the first time in my previous employment role. It was the smoothest and most transparent onboarding and off boarding experience I have ever had. All of my employee information could be easily found in one place along with SSO for all my necessary work related applications. So much time saved! This reflected very positively on my overall opinion of the company I was getting started with as well.</p>
