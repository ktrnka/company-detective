      <p>Not good. Some employees can simply click the app icon and be automatically logged in. I have to go through a multi step process... Email address, password, authenticator code. I even have an additional security code. Seems like a bit much. I'm not logging in to a high level confidential government database that stores nuclear weapon launch codes....

It's like the developers aren't aware of or care about real privacy but just like to say they do. I wouldn't use this service in my startup, privacy abomination.

      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <h4>Difficult app, 3 stars (mrsuggestions, Apple App Store, 2022-08-25)</h4>
      <p>Difficult app on the end user side - some issues below:

1. The app works better on iphone than android

2. Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.

3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. 

4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.

5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. 

6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. 

7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so 
If you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?

8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up. Better to start the call off indicating how i know them and who and why i am calling.</p>

      <h4>Awful benefits software, 1 stars (syedhali, Apple App Store, 2023-07-21)</h4>
      <p>One star because payroll works, but wow this is the worst benefits software I’ve ever used. Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.

That’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. 

Rippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end. Come on rippling this isn’t a fun todo list app startup, it’s people’s lives. Put some humans on the phone…</p>

      <p>I helped implement Rippling for my company and have been working as one of the main admins. It’s been challenging to get used to and get it all set up but each day we find little things that make our lives easier or that add excitement to already existing processes. I know there’s a lot we aren’t currently utilizing but hoping to get there with time. Rippling’s support is also exceptional. I always get a response even when using the chat feature. :)</p>

      <h4>Invisible button??, 1 stars (Free hat, Apple App Store, 2023-05-17)</h4>
      <p>In the older version of the app it was much easier to navigate to all sections including employee information. After an update I thought they got rid of a whole section because there was no longer a button to access it. Then I accidentally discovered if you press on the top right corner you can access your profile and employment information. There is zero indication that you have to press up there and it almost feels like the app is trying to hide that information from you. Otherwise it's just a really poor design choice</p>

      <h4>Great in Theory, but lots of issues, 1 stars (Content Creator 17426, Apple App Store, 2025-01-15)</h4>
      <p>My company recently transferred over, and there are tons of bugs, especially with this mobile app. 

The app does not have push notifications, you can only receive text/email notifications, and there is no control of which notifications to receive. 

When a text notification is received, and you open the app, there is nowhere that indicates where that notification came from or 

Open shifts can be picked up by multiple employees, even if one has already been approved for it. Open shift notifications go to every employee, even if they aren’t qualified for the shift.

Employees cannot see the team schedule more than a week in advance on the app.

Any changes to an employee’s profile takes hours to process. 

These are just a few of the myriad issues occurring.

Our company rep seems great, but they’re inundated with all the issues that have been occurring, and it does not seem like Rippling is providing enough help.

Will update my review if user experience improves. Would not recommend making the switch.</p>

      <h4>Loving Rippling!, 5 stars (suzteam, Apple App Store, 2020-11-01)</h4>
      <p>Our organization just made a switch from one of the larger HRIS systems to Rippling and I am  loving it! 
As an employee, I experience it as super user friendly, yet it can do so much- payroll, benefits, ATS, etc. Just got my first paycheck notification and it was so fun, not archaic feeling!</p>
