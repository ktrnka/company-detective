      <p>Stop burning through my mobile data please! All of Rippling used 292 MB of mobile data in Sept and already used 160 MB in the first two weeks in October. How is that even possible? It makes no sense. I just use the app to punch and out at work and I'm on wifi most of the time. What ever data you're collecting over there, I'd like it to stop. At least have the decency to collect it when I'm on wifi. Not everyone has an unlimited data plan ya know.</p>

      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <p>This is the worst HR company setup I've ever dealt with. They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage. If I wasn't forced to use this POS system for work I'd never, ever work with them again. I wish I could give zero stars.</p>

      <p>The fact that it tries to play FSA authority and denying eligible expenses is bs. Would encourage HR folks to find/use alternatives like Justworks or Gusto. Sure, Rippling is an "all-in-one", but it doesn't do 'all' of it well. Snafus with I-9 verifications and onboarding flows where you CAN'T opt out of certain offerings abound.</p>

      <p>This app has gotten better over the years however it's still horrible, The biggest issue being that only the Admin for a company is allowed to give feedback on their app they don't take feedback from the people who actually use their product. Poorly coded, i.e. When selecting a state by pressing the letter t it brings up all the states with the letter t. And I really wish they would separate Job switching( Which I do multiple times a day) from state switching(which I rarely do).</p>

      <p>Rippling was a relatively new adoption at my current employer and I’ve never had onboarding be such a seamless process. What usually takes days wasted on the front end, Rippling facilitated and automated to happen in about an hour we’ll before my first day. 

Beyond onboarding, it provides so much clarity in knowledge from the planned holiday calendar to the organizational chart—both smoothed out “ripples” I otherwise thought were inescapable as an employee. Having PTO requests with clear counters of what PTO time and types I have left has also proven to streamline PTO request process and cut down on any confusion as year end comes.</p>

      <p>In the older version of the app it was much easier to navigate to all sections including employee information. After an update I thought they got rid of a whole section because there was no longer a button to access it. Then I accidentally discovered if you press on the top right corner you can access your profile and employment information. There is zero indication that you have to press up there and it almost feels like the app is trying to hide that information from you. Otherwise it's just a really poor design choice</p>

      <p>Have you ever been a new hire for a company and gone through numerous back & forth emails, drowning in doc attachments, and details of your employee benefits while still left dumbfounded? Yeah, we've all been there! When my previously workplace swapped from a competitor (strictly for paystub purposes) to Rippling, it was day and night! All the information I needed was finally organized in one space: directory/employee hierarchy, insurance, tax info, etc. This essentially eliminated the nightmares of going through old saved emails with personal information, lost in the grapevine translations, and moved towards a more streamlined process. Lastly, I enjoy the constant "reminders" of essentials I need to sign and authorize such as benefit deadlines. I cannot imagine going back to any other platform. I wished every workplace integrated rippling into their systems.</p>
