      <p>Stop burning through my mobile data please! All of Rippling used 292 MB of mobile data in Sept and already used 160 MB in the first two weeks in October. How is that even possible? It makes no sense. I just use the app to punch and out at work and I'm on wifi most of the time. What ever data you're collecting over there, I'd like it to stop. At least have the decency to collect it when I'm on wifi. Not everyone has an unlimited data plan ya know.</p>

      <p>You guys really need to tighten this thing up. The app resets to the home screen when you switch and come back without a grace period. You're practically begging people to make typos in their banking information since users can't switch apps to copy things and paste them. Further, there are sections of the app that just don't seem to work, like payment splitting which let's me play with amounts, but not actually save changes. Sort it out. It's frustrating. But there's potential here.</p>

      <p>This is the worst HR company setup I've ever dealt with. They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage. If I wasn't forced to use this POS system for work I'd never, ever work with them again. I wish I could give zero stars.</p>

      <p>This app has gotten better over the years however it's still horrible, The biggest issue being that only the Admin for a company is allowed to give feedback on their app they don't take feedback from the people who actually use their product. Poorly coded, i.e. When selecting a state by pressing the letter t it brings up all the states with the letter t. And I really wish they would separate Job switching( Which I do multiple times a day) from state switching(which I rarely do).</p>

Slow load times, items that have been selected somehow never actually were when you go back into the app.... i.e. hitting "clock out" and going back hours later just to realize that it never actually clocked you out. Incorrect countdown times for breaks unless the app is closed out completely and opened fresh. The app simply refuses to work unless it is opened completely fresh every time. The design is fine, but the rest needs work, please.</p>

      <p>This company is poorly set up to actually do the basic thing it is meant to do- payroll. It does not automatically update rates nor do they check to make sure that the agency they are paying taxes to is correct. My (now ex) accountant set the system up, did not give me total access, and then the Rippling system did not actually look into verifying any information. The other issue we had was that taxes were not paid on time A LOT *or* to the wrong agency *or* (this one is impressive) to the wrong account. How is this company even legal?? On top of that nothing is intuitive on their platform- I don’t think the developers have ever actually ran payroll based on how this app is laid our. They are serving other payroll companies on a platter and tbh, just take the other option, this company is a disaster.</p>

Integration: Deployment is very smooth in this platform and as a new company you get the basics, from software & antivirus deployment, to users management. The platform definitely makes it easy to get a user in, procure and assign a workstation with software and security on it.

Multi-use: The platform does a great job integrating HR tasks from employee onboarding to health benefits/open enrollment. It also does a good job integrating HR with IT tasks.

If you own a startup and are looking for something to get you going without pain and in one platform then Rippling is for you.</p>

      <p>I’m a fairly new Rippling user, but this is my new standard. It’s so convenient that I can do everything I need by myself, without having to bug our HR Director. In the past, I had to get a hold of HR to make any changes. And I’ve even had to sign physical paperwork to do so. Not anymore! I’m still getting familiar with all the features, but all I can say is that Rippling makes things so much easier. Way to go!</p>

SO easy and light.  Everything in one place, simple navigation, and so capable.  All you need, nothing you don’t.  What a relief.

Not sure about market share or how prevalent use of this product is, but compared to what I’ve used previously, it should be the default choice among its peers.</p>
