        <h1>About Oumi</h1>
<p>Oumi is a company dedicated to creating an open AI ecosystem that encourages collaboration among researchers, developers, and institutions to advance AI technology. The company was founded on January 1, 2024, in collaboration with researchers from 13 leading universities, including Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and MIT <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oumi">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. Oumi operates as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which allows it to balance its mission-driven approach with sustainable business operations <a href="https://obvious.com/ideas/why-we-invested-in-oumi/">(Shah, Obvious, 2025-01-29)</a>.</p>
<p>Oumi's primary product is an all-in-one open platform for building, evaluating, and deploying AI models. This platform is designed to support a wide range of users, including individual developers, researchers, and enterprises, by providing tools for pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluating models. The platform is compatible with various model architectures and supports deployment across different environments, including local and cloud settings <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2025/01/29/ai-needs-its-linux-oumi-comes-out-of-stealth-with-an-open-source-vision/">(Eadline &amp; Hampton, HPCwire, 2025-01-29)</a>.</p>
