<h2>Critiques and Mixed Sentiments about Oumi</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, there's just too much going on with her design for my tastes. Jaguar traits, roller skater, DJ, blacksmith, AND artist is... a <em>lot</em> for a single character." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq53z6k/">(LameSillyHero, Reddit, 2024-10-03)</a></li>

<li>"Compared to so many characters in this game having 'comically overworked' as a defining character trait, it's honestly refreshing to see Xilonen's characterization include maintaining a work-life balance." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq3bb1j/">(Hydrokine, Reddit, 2024-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"I like that her most notable skill isnâ€™t that she can forge ancient names out of liquid pyro energy hotter than magma. Itâ€™s that 'she has a good work/life balance.' Truly one of the hardest skills. Harder than any combat style or profession." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1fuzckb/character_introduction_ardent_flames_forge_the/lq7sa5h/">(None, Reddit, 2024-10-03)</a></li>
