        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Negative Sentiment Towards Vulcan Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Vulcan Inc fucking sucks. But that’s what you get when you have someone like Bert Kolde at the helm, whose main qualification for the job was to have the right roommate in college." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/ieznq8w/">(Drazen44, Reddit, 2022-07-05)</a></li>

<li>"Having an owner that appears to not be fully invested in winning generally is not good. Jody is still here because of financial reasons." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/iezdd36/">(QuasiContract, Reddit, 2022-07-05)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Legal Issues and Controversies</h2>
<ul>
<li>"The Vulcan lawsuit was a civil suit that settled out of court and never had a criminal investigation. The allegations against Vulcan were sexual harassment, not sexual assault." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0j9kuu/">(Bill_Salmons, Reddit, 2022-03-13)</a></li>

<li>"It's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you. The Alto is a blast to use." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/">(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)</a></li>
<li>"Living computers museum was a great treasure to the city, I was sad to hear that when Paul A passed that his sister was not willing to uphold his legacy as a tech visionary." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq9s9mc/">(heapinhelpin1979, Reddit, 2024-02-13)</a></li>

</ul>
