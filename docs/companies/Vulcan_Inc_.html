        <h2>Negative Sentiment Towards Vulcan Inc. and Ownership</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Vulcan Inc fucking sucks. But that’s what you get when you have someone like Bert Kolde at the helm, whose main qualification for the job was to have the right roommate in college." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/ieznq8w/">(Drazen44, Reddit, 2022-07-05)</a></li>

<li>"Having an owner that appears to not be fully invested in winning generally is not good. Jody is still here because of financial reasons." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/iezdd36/">(QuasiContract, Reddit, 2022-07-05)</a></li>
<li>"I care not about who she is, she’s not Paul Allen and as the head of the foundation, she’s done a poor job holding the staff and administration to task for major weaknesses." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/iezijwa/">(cajunhawk, Reddit, 2022-07-05)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Legal and Controversial Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Few things. The Vulcan lawsuit was a civil suit that settled out of court and never had a criminal investigation.

<li>"The reason I point out I don’t root for the owner is to highlight what the issue is with deshaun Watson." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0iuqcr/">(tlsrandy, Reddit, 2022-03-13)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment Towards Living Computers: Museum + Labs (LCM+L)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/">(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)</a></li>

<li>"They refunded my membership purchase… I didn't think it was going to reopen? I mean - hope it does." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kqbnr63/">(zoltarpanaflex, Reddit, 2024-02-14)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Positive Sentiment Towards Vulcan Inc. Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Not sure what the ownership situation would look like (Vulcan Inc. seems likely), but the city has a pretty diverse economy so they'd have no problem with corporate seats." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1jxbdy/">(None, Reddit, 2018-06-30)</a></li>
<li>"Check out Vulcan in Seattle for example." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw99zvu/">(pandasareprettycool, Reddit, 2018-03-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Commentary on Urban Development and Projects</h2>

<li>"Vulcan sponsored the development of the SLUT: it supported their plans for redeveloping SLU." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic97p5p/">(godofsexandGIS, Reddit, 2022-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"The South Lake Union Trolley 'was conceived as part of the redevelopment of South Lake Union into a technology hub, with lobbying and financial support from Paul Allen and his venture capital firm Vulcan Inc.'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9e0xb/">(Bardamu1932, Reddit, 2022-06-13)</a></li>
