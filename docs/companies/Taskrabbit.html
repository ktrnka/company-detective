        <h1>About Taskrabbit</h1>
<p>Taskrabbit, Inc. is an American online marketplace that connects individuals with local freelancers, known as "Taskers," who provide various services. The company was founded in 2008 by Leah Busque and initially operated under the name RunMyErrand before rebranding to Taskrabbit in 2010. In 2017, Taskrabbit was acquired by an affiliate of IKEA, which has significantly influenced its growth and service offerings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskrabbit">(Wikipedia, 2012)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit operates in over 75 cities across eight countries, with a network of more than 200,000 independent Taskers as of 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskrabbit">(Wikipedia, 2012)</a>. The company has transitioned to a remote-first model, allowing employees to work flexibly while maintaining hubs in key locations such as San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London <a href="https://www.builtinsf.com/company/taskrabbit">(BuiltInSF, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit's platform allows users to hire Taskers for a variety of services, including handyman services, moving assistance, furniture assembly, cleaning, and personal assistant tasks. The platform also supports virtual tasks, such as data entry and guidance via video calls, emphasizing safety and flexibility, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">(Taskrabbit, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company primarily generates revenue through service fees charged to Taskers, which can be as high as 70% of the original bid for tasks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskrabbit">(Wikipedia, 2012)</a>. Taskrabbit serves a diverse customer base, including individuals needing help with everyday tasks and small businesses seeking assistance with various operational needs. The platform is particularly beneficial for those who require immediate or same-day services <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">(Taskrabbit, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit has experienced substantial growth, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the demand for gig economy services. The company has also expanded its service offerings through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Dolly, a moving services company, in November 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskrabbit">(Wikipedia, 2012)</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Customer Service Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Work didn't hold for more than a couple hours. Customer support ignored multiple emails and then issued a credit for future work not a refund for the job that didn't hold." <a href="https://google_play/ede5336e-e5cb-4882-b116-a7a549c7dfd1">(Grant Bellamy, Google Play Store, 2024-11-11)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>App Functionality Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"They allow you to select Apple Pay but it doesn’t work. It just always says 'can’t pre authorize'." <a href="https://apple/11340400621">(J.C.Price, Apple App Store, 2024-06-03)</a></li>
<li>"The App is ok. Definitely needs Improvement as it's quite laggy and navigation is cumbersome." <a href="https://google_play/9e660234-1d18-40de-9898-ac3def82159c">(Chin, Google Play Store, 2024-12-28)</a></li>
<li>"I've never had more trouble with an app than this one. The app only worked the first time I downloaded it and now I can't access my profile." <a href="https://google_play/d0b04c3c-df04-4249-a36c-5478d73b58da">(Andrew Paul, Google Play Store, 2024-11-06)</a></li>
<li>"You have to pre authorize just to look at taskers for a job. This ridiculous. Why should I have to put a charge on my credit card just to look at people that I might want to hire? I will never use this to hire anyone ever again because of this." <a href="https://apple/12045207560">(Notalagirl, Apple App Store, 2024-12-09)</a></li>
<li>"Slow, buggy app. Not able to search for services by availability. Hired an 'elite tasker' who didn’t show up. Do not rely on this app." <a href="https://apple/12082626400">(CousinGreg22, Apple App Store, 2024-12-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Tasker Reliability Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"My wardrobe assembly task was scheduled for today but cancelled at very last moment without even informing me." <a href="https://google_play/724e5ca7-5ca5-475e-b49a-45d40ea2c2a9">(Subodh Singh, Google Play Store, 2025-01-09)</a></li>
<li>"Impossible to book this, I give up after trying for two weeks straight. There should be a penalty to the task professionals that confirm a task and then cancel. Huge waste of time trying to hire someone here. Deleted the app now." <a href="https://apple/11109866338">(day_viana, Apple App Store, 2024-04-01)</a></li>
<li>"Taskers accept task and cancel if something better comes along. Poor overall experience and customer service, workmanship and no ownership by the company when things go wrong." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/lzk19e2/">(Common_Gate3718, Reddit, 2024-11-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Tasker Quality and Pricing</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The fees that Taskrabbit adds to the Taskers' rate is extremely high. I did not know of the fee (and just how high it was) before enrolling my task and searching for taskers." <a href="https://google_play/a73a1b73-0ccb-4bf8-8f02-fa9a9143855e">(Judah A, Google Play Store, 2024-12-19)</a></li>
<li>"My tasker did a ~10 minute job and I was charged for 2hrs worth of work because of his 2hr minimum. To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least." <a href="https://apple/11065672864">(Dara U., Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</a></li>
<li>"Used TR for the first time this week and my tasker definitely overcharged me (2hrs to move a couch 3 blocks) which was upsetting. But I contacted TR and they quickly took care of it and made sure that I only had to pay for 1, which was great." <a href="https://apple/11774976049">(Brandy Shea, Apple App Store, 2024-09-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>General Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The application has only one goal, to withdraw very large fees and not to take any responsibility." <a href="https://apple/11530271987">(One from Bayou, Apple App Store, 2024-07-24)</a></li>
<li>"Task rabbit charged a 33% fee on top of my task without telling me about it when booking." <a href="https://apple/11386560338">(chloekur, Apple App Store, 2024-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"I did not like how the app does not show the final charges before you can submit a review. It also asks you to tip before seeing the charges." <a href="https://apple/11160183205">(BMA77, Apple App Store, 2024-04-14)</a></li>

      <h4>1 stars (EnyaInTheWorld, Google Play Store, 2025-01-12)</h4>
      <p>I don't understand why IKEA continues to refer Task Rabbit to clients. Task Rabbit staff will grab a booking just so they can secure a job that the client has paid for in advance at IKEA. Then the Task Rabbit Tasker will try to rebook the appointment, sometimes numerous times. Additionally, Task Rabbit doesn't recognize 'old' passwords so a client will have to register a new P/W. If the client does not do so, the client can not communicate w/ the Tasker.</p>

      <p>BAD SERVICE!!!!! My wardrobe assembly task was scheduled for today but cancelled at very last moment without even informing me. No cancellation confirmation or call was received from their end. Just a cancelled message. Their is no guarantee that if you have spare some time from your busy schedule for a tasker, then he/she will surely come or not. Taskrabbit will not inform you. No new tasker was assigned. Now I have to wait more as their is no near future appointments available.</p>

      <p>I had a Tasker cancel a MOVING TASK at 11pm the night before the task. If the client does this, you'd get charged a bunch of fees. The taskers however are able to do it without any repercussion. I can't even leave a review for the Tasker that burned me to let others know that Tasker is unreliable. Immediate uninstall. There's literally no incentive for taskers to honor their commitments. They'll cancel whenever.</p>

      <p>1. The app is extremely slow to start up. Takes literally seven seconds to get past the blank screen (on Pixel 8 Pro running latest Android). 2. Task's fee is not shown until after you pay for a task. Seems illegal. 3. Tasks don't have a status. Eg. my task has been completed, half a day later, still don't know what it'll cost me (what tasker reported) and the task status (if such thing exists) hasn't changed at all.</p>

      <p>The App is ok. Definitely needs Improvement as it's quite laggy and navigation is cumbersome. Booked two Taskers within days of each other; First Tasker cancelled in the late/early hours of the day that he had agreed to come and do the task. Second Tasker was adamant that I cancel the Job on the app and work offline before he accepted to start the Job. Never heard from him again. I've proceeded with a rival app and im rueing not using it in the first instance. I just hit the uninstall button.</p>

      <p>App works good but beware. If somebody charges you for 22 hours when they only worked 2 hours you have to fight to get a refund and then they won't even refund you all the money. They refunded me like 60% of it. So for a 2-hour job it still is going to charge me over $160. Plus the horrible tasker wanted to be paid through PayPal so an additional $450 was taken for this 2-hour job. Never again. Just don't use</p>

      <p>They constantly lower prices they pay to their taskers. Expecting someone to drive out to somebodies house and build a wardobe for £22 on a self employed basis They are now taking 60+% of the price the client is paying on IKEA flat rate. They claim we're self employed and can choose our work but they penalise you for refusing to work at these rates and ban you from the platform. How is that choosing your own work ? Ontop of that the support is absolutely useless. Avoid at all costs</p>

      <p>Indeed, it's a phishing business! It takes a lot to find a tasker on the app, and if you find one, they demand a huge amount of money and long hours of work for a small task. And then if you cancel them, they will charge you for the cancellation. So this is a win-win play for the TaskRabbit robbers and a big loss for the customer. Also, forget about customer service; they don't help you at all.</p>

      <p>The app is made to dupe people into paying more. They have so many hidden charges and they make it easy for the tasker to charge you more which gives them a larger percentage of money earned.

      <h4>What was I thinking, 1 stars (Poke you, Apple App Store, 2024-02-01)</h4>
      <p>I don’t know what I was thinking using this app I read some of the reviews and I said OK let me give it a try. First Tasker was elite Tasker, so I had high expectations high standards.. the reviews were stellar, this tasker canceled on me, if anyone knows me, I plan I am detail oriented and when a game plan in place for anything I schedule. The task failed to communicate to me that her current job she was working on got pushed back so that means she wouldn’t have gotten to me until about 930pm 
So I had to keep it moving, but I said hey second chances, let me give him a try, the customer service gave me a $35 credit so I said why not, second tasker was second and highest rating with good reviews. People if I show you the pictures of the mess that was left in my house little girl was not even worth the money she’s charging.

I’ve put in two calls today to Taskrabbit responded to their email with the photos to make very clear I will not be paying anyone any money. 

The only good thing out of this process was the customer service reps, attempting and trying to help other than that I will not be using this app again</p>

      <h4>Exploitative ‘minimum hour’ practice, 1 stars (Dara U., Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</h4>
      <p>My tasker did a ~10 minute job and I was charged for 2hrs worth of work because of his 2hr minimum. To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least. I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. 
(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue. They have no vested interest in customer retention. Dont waste your time)
Don’t even get me started on a ~30% added support fee PER HOUR! Go to a professional company or local handyman, don’t use this app—at least your money would be worth it.</p>

      <p>I’ve had great taskers, but I’ve also hired way too many unreliable taskers who cancelled at the last minute without so much as a “sorry.” There’s zero accountability. You can’t even give a tasker a low rating to warn other customers about their unreliability because once they cancel the app no longer gives you access to leave a review. Sometimes you get lucky and the person you hire turns out to be excellent, but it’s a gamble every time.</p>

      <h4>TaskRabbit: Where Reliability Takes a Vacation and Never Returns, 1 stars (mihoutaowww, Apple App Store, 2024-03-23)</h4>
      <p>TaskRabbit, the epitome of unprofessionalism and unreliability. If you're looking for a service that will consistently disappoint and leave you high and dry, look no further.
My experience with TaskRabbit has been an exercise in frustration and wasted time. Three times, I've scheduled cleaning services through their platform, and three times, I've been left scrambling at the last minute because the maid decided she had better things to do.
It's bad enough to have your plans thrown into disarray by a cancellation, but what's truly maddening is the complete lack of consequences for these flaky maids. They can bail on appointments with impunity, leaving customers like me in the lurch, and TaskRabbit doesn't bat an eyelash.
And don't even get me started on TaskRabbit's customer service – or lack thereof. When I reached out for assistance after yet another cancellation, I was met with nothing but indifference and excuses. It's clear they have no interest in actually helping their customers or holding their so-called "taskers" accountable.
TaskRabbit's motto should be "We'll be there for you... until we're not." Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this sham of a service. There are plenty of other platforms out there that actually value their customers' time and deserve their hard-earned money. TaskRabbit isn't one of them.</p>

I do think there are features lacking in the app that would hold taskers more accountable.

No wonder he had five star reviews because people loved him WHEN HE SHOWED UP, but there’s no way to hold him accountable when he doesn’t show up.</p>

      <p>I highly recommend Mykola for any handyman services you may need. He arrived promptly, demonstrating excellent professionalism from the start. Equipped with a wide array of tools and fully prepared for the task at hand, he wasted no time getting to work. To my surprise, Mykola completed the job in a fraction of the time that another handyman had estimated it would take. His prompt and effective service not only saved me precious time and money, but also alleviated any unnecessary stress. Given the exceptional quality of his work, I believe he deserves more than just a standard tip. Had I opted for a different handyman, I would have likely incurred double the expenses and wasted valuable time.

Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend Mykola's services to anyone in need.With Mykola, you can trust that your project will be in good hands every time. He is a true professional with relieble and an unmatched skill set, and I am immensely grateful for his invaluable assistance.</p>

      <h4>As a Tasker, 1 stars (2yrEliteTasker, Apple App Store, 2024-12-02)</h4>
      <p>I've been working as a Tasker and we use TaskRabbit to find workers.

This is mainly for people to read that book as clients.

1) READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GIG. If You book us for jobs that aren’t a match. You waste our time and yours. But TR dings US for forfeiting the job and flags your account.

2) DO NOT HIRE WITHOUT DETAILS.
There’s different depths of certain gigs. Like cleaning, “clean my house” doesn’t cut it. How bad is it? Size?

3)DO NOT DISAPPEAR this is known as “client is unresponsive in chat” the gig gets canceled. 

4) BE AVAILABLE TO REPLY

5) DO NOT GET MIFFED BECAUSE THINGS HAVE TO BE IN WRITING.
This is for our and your protection. Verbally asking for a deep clean during a regular clean then disputing the extra charge after it’s finished happens a lot. There are shady clients believe it or not. 

6) BE HOME or leave us access. Running more than 15 minutes late is unacceptable. We have other jobs to get to and need to be on time because so we don’t get bad reviews.

I recently got restricted for declining jobs. The jobs were declined because they were biohazards and because the client didn’t respond. Task Rabbit’s team lacks the logic of making decisions based on reviews. Their solution is to penalize an elite Tasker and affect their livelihood while also keeping them from generating revenue for the company collected in fees.

I have already submitted a complaint and appeal.</p>

      <p>I recently moved to a new state and needed assistance with mounting and assembling furniture, so I hired someone for two days. Unfortunately, the individual lacked the necessary skills, resulting in significant damage to five walls and improper installation of several items. Additionally, the worker only spoke Russian, which was not indicated on the app, leading to a frustrating language barrier.

To make matters worse, I discovered that the worker had stolen some of our tech including my boyfriend’s PS5 gaming accessories, controllers and cables. The worker had access to a room with covered boxes and took advantage of our absence to go through our belongings.

I contacted customer service immediately, and they promised a response within two days, but never followed through. When I tried to follow up, my ticket was closed without resolution. Despite submitting a new ticket, I have not received any reply, and it has now been over a week with no progress.</p>

      <h4>Frustrate Rabbit, 1 stars (kskskskjrufurjejele, Apple App Store, 2024-11-21)</h4>
      <p>The business logic is so flawed. You have to confirm a booking before you can contact a tasker and message them about their availability. The entire app is designed around assuming taskers respond to chat on time and confirm booking, however that is RARELY the case. 

I have been trying to find a cleaner for tomorrow, I booked yesterday and the tasker still hasn’t responded. 

I cannot risk them not showing up and leave me stranded so I want to switch to a different tasker who might respond on time. 

When you try to rebook, the app asks what happened. The options should include “the Tasker is not responsive”. 

I try to proceed. I get “tasker is still scoping the job you cannot reschedule, do you want to book a second job?” No, I don’t. 

Your only options shouldn’t be double booking or waiting for a no-show or hoping the tasker will see and confirm or cancel on time. You need to have a respond within 2 hours of booking or confirm before 24 hours of appointment rule in the app. 

When I switched from app to web browser it showed the tasker finally canceled and showed me other available taskers. The option on top is the same tasker who just canceled!

Overall very poor user experience.</p>

Also paying all the taskers the same flat rate as opposed to allowing taskers to set their own rates is a disgusting way to treat workers. Somebody who has been a tasker for years with solid reviews should not be paid the same as a person who just started. Professionals should be able to adjust their rates to reflect their level of expertise. As a customer who values good work I would truly rather pay more for somebody with good reviews and experience than pay somebody that I got randomly assigned with no choice in the matter.</p>

      <p>They allow you to select Apple Pay but it doesn’t work. It just always says “can’t pre authorize”.  I then used the exact same card outside of Apple Pay and it worked fine.</p>

      <h4>Takers consistently cancel at the last minute, 1 stars (KaCar145289, Apple App Store, 2024-05-11)</h4>
      <p>While this isn’t the apps fault per say, I’ve tried to hire 3 separate taskers for 3 different tasks and they always cancel at the last minute. I’ve scheduled anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 days in advance and each time they’ve accepted and then suddenly need to cancel, for forgotten plans with grandma to taking a cat to the vet. Like come on. I’m reserving my busy schedule for a service and I plan my day around it. And then they cancel last minute. Sometimes they try to offer a replacement, in this case that was someone with no reviews yet. No thanks. Task rabbit needs to find a way to make this app more useable and not waste everyone’s time. You’ve lost a customer that you never even had in the first place because not one, two, but three times my tasks were cancelled. Cleaning and yard work that never happened. What a joke</p>

      <h4>Task Rabbits do not show, 1 stars (JenHolm, Apple App Store, 2024-02-03)</h4>
      <p>Second time in a mont that I booked a task rabbit a week in advance.  The day of we are all set ready to go and need the person.  They cancel and no show.  If they cancel even 1 hour before the task starts you will not be able to write a review.  Due to this many tasters have a much higher rating than they should have.</p>

      <h4>Mover cancelled last hour, 1 stars (elsarkazmo, Apple App Store, 2024-04-27)</h4>
      <p>Kywaune M. In the Los Angeles county area cancelled the move of our appliances LITERALLY on the last hour of our scheduled time.  Like many, I have a very tight schedule with a fixed deadline and I trusted this company and this mover to help me meet those deadlines and I regret not going with another company. Most places charge the customer a few for cancellations to scheduling of any kind so companies should be penalized or compensate their customers accordingly. Never trusting this app again</p>

      <p>This app used to be great. Now this is the third Tasker that cancels the day off when this has been planned for days. No explanation and you can’t leave a review for someone who cancels on you without giving a reason. And when you try to contact support they are not 24/7 and you get stuck chatting to an even more than usual useless bot. Deleted the app. Yellow pages would be better</p>

      <h4>Incompetent “help” by unscreened “taskers”, 1 stars (Karhart, Apple App Store, 2024-06-04)</h4>
      <p>I just needed someone to spend an hour creating a little bracket to hold my AC in the window to prevent it from falling. Other than that, I just needed the person to hoist the AC up there. What I got was three hours of a guy sawing 2x4’s IN MY LIVINGROOM, sending sawdust throughout the house, then screwing and unscrewing the same few pieces of random-length wood into my window for 3 hours. He did not complete the task, and I finally had to send him home. Did I mention he was two hours late? This is a guy who had 50 “reviews” and a 4.9 star rating.  I have absolutely no faith in Task Rabbit after this experience.</p>
