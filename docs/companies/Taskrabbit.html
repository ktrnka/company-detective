        <h1>About Taskrabbit</h1>
<p>Taskrabbit is a marketplace platform founded on January 1, 2008, by Leah Busque. It connects individuals with local freelancers, known as "Taskers," who provide various home-related services. The company was acquired by the Ingka Group (IKEA) in 2017, which has facilitated its expansion and integration with IKEA's offerings, particularly in furniture assembly and home improvement tasks <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit operates in thousands of cities across nine countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is also available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. The platform serves a diverse customer base, primarily individuals seeking help with household tasks, moving, and personal errands. Taskrabbit is a B2C company, facilitating connections between clients and Taskers through its online marketplace and mobile application.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $37.8 million in funding across seven rounds, with the latest being a Series C round in July 2012 <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8">(TaskRabbit Company Overview, 2021)</a>. While current revenue figures are undisclosed, the integration with IKEA is expected to enhance its financial performance through increased service demand.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit's services include handyman services, moving assistance, furniture assembly, cleaning, lawn care, plumbing, grocery shopping, and more. The platform allows for same-day bookings, depending on Tasker availability <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/">(TaskRabbit Services, 2021)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>

      <p>I've never had more trouble with an app than this one. The app only worked the first time I downloaded it and now I can't access my profile. It would constantly load,but never connect even though I'm on Wi-Fi with a strong signal. I unstalled and reinstalled it, but that only made things worse. I've had to delete and redownload this app 13 times and restart my phone after each attempt. I still cannot access my account and it seems like I'm not the only that has had this issue. Use another app!</p>

      <p>Indeed, it's a phishing business! It takes a lot to find a tasker on the app, and if you find one, they demand a huge amount of money and long hours of work for a small task. And then if you cancel them, they will charge you for the cancellation. So this is a win-win play for the TaskRabbit robbers and a big loss for the customer. Also, forget about customer service; they don't help you at all.</p>

      <p>Totally rubbish. We had to book two separate people for a job that needed 2 people and one of them cancelled less than 1 hour before the job leaving us liable for the cost of the other person. Then no way to leave negative review of person that cancelled last minute or to contact them in any way. They cancelled because they got a higher paying job.</p>

      <p>This app doesn't say it upfront, but there's a hidden ~37% fee that Taskrabbit charges PER hour that. That is absolutely ridiculous, especially when it's closest competitors are free to use. Do yourself favor and find someone to hire through another app.</p>

      <p>I would have hired a tasker for a simple electrical task (1 hr or less) in a minute but there's no way I'm paying a "happiness tax" or whatever the heck TaskRabbit calls it so I'll just find an independent local electrician who will do it for me without this nonsensical intervention by a company that's charging a fee that I'm sure does not go into the service providers pocket.</p>

      <p>I am not receiving push notifications when a tasker messages me. In settings, I can only see an option to enable offers and recommendations via push, but for task updates it can only come through SMS which defeats the purpose of a mobile app... The text just tells me someone messaged me, I can't read or reply. I then need to log into the app to read the message. I tried to reach out to support but they're offline and the link to the support center displays an access denied message 🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>Simply rubbish app. Either crashes or just hangs. Cache cleared and multiple uninstall/reinstall makes no difference. Can't even sign up now. If you're a 'tasker' you may struggle to reach or be found by your potential Customers. Think about what the impact on revenue may be. I'll be going back to using one of the big players already in this space who are bothered about customer experience when using their app.</p>

      <p>Great taskers, lower rating because there's fees on fees. They take somewhere around 17% cut from the tasker's rate on top of charging trust and support fees. That's like a massive 35% of the gross rate, excluding taxes.</p>

They then cancelled at 2am the day before they were due to come without any explanation. Wish I hadn't bothered, total waste of time.

      <p>Taskers are not sufficiently monitored, are unreliable, confrontational, and are extremely rude. While cancellation might sometimes be warranted, app allows for constant cancellation by taskers, and the lack of an immediate hire feature means that this can result in several days' of setback, leaving the clients in serious predicaments. This is upsetting, as many taskers are kind and very helpful, but lack of supervision allows poor taskers to proliferate and even extort, crwoding out the others</p>

      <p>I’ve come across two technical issues when using this app for the past week. 

1. When I’m browsing though the list of professionals, you can compare their hourly rate. the summary page before booking shows an entirely different rate. I thought the tasker I selected just had unexplained hidden fees, but when I tried to book another professional, it shows the same unexplained rate. It’s not until you commit to booking that it shows the accurate rate from the browse page. 

2. When I rescheduled an appointment for 4pm through the app, it sent a message to the tasker that I rescheduled for 2pm. 

The technical issues are small, but they can have a huge impact. They can lead to miscommunication around price and timing of the appointment, which are the most important features of the app in my opinion</p>

It would also be really nice to have a longer list of tasks somewhere. For example, by entering random words I found out that I can hire people for Event Planning or Senior Care. I wouldn’t have even guessed either one. (And I could have used one of them in the past.)</p>

So wrap up I was double charged unfairly ( I can only understand one cancellation fee but the other was NOT FAIR). Their customer support will lie yo you!

I have the expert report to prove the damage cannot be fixed partially and the prove of tasker's mistake did the damage, but the agent ignored my reasonable request and insisted of her ridiculous terms of Happiness Pledge. I AM NOT HAPPY! Now I have to pay extra $410 BY MY SELF because of the damage caused by this platform. I lost my brand new TV, I lost my money, I lost my valuable time. This case is extremely unfair and makes me with huge anger. I will never recommend this platform and will left 1 star in APP and all social ratings, also I will say goodbye to IKEA who owns this platform. After the repair, I will consider to turn this case to small claim court. The current resolution is a joke.</p>

The “trust and support fee” is sometimes disproportionately high given the task, which is especially frustrating when the tasker does a poor job and you have to start the search over.  

The app is incredibly glitchy, even after updates. The site is also glitchy (or maybe poorly designed). Specifically:
-times that tasks are scheduled for often don’t display properly 
-tasks don’t move from upcoming to completed when they should
-tipping is difficult or impossible to access because the window just disappears (with repeated attempts)
-messages with tasker get lost
-task time changes don’t get saved</p>

First you can no longer choose or look at taskers and their reviews or price range taking the whole process out of your hands and leaving it to faith to a random person in your home with possible 0 reviews or experience. I understand a fair chance for new taskers but as a business owner myself, building up your reputation can equate to charging your own price so this also makes it unfair to the workers.  

The minimum $80+ flat fee/hr is exhortation even for small tasks, just doesn’t make sense the price cost for certain tasks.

      <p>First off, there’s something majorly wrong with the UI that encourages the taskers to cancel 90% of jobs. I’m guessing there’s no way to connect the calendar to their Google calendar so there’s no way to keep it up to date? Not sure that’s it but TaskRabbit seriously needs to get on top of this. Maybe fix your UI and also start downgrading taskers ratings if they cancel. 

Secondly there’s no way to edit a task once it’s written. You have to delete it and resubmit it for bids. So if you have a tasker accept, and write their name in the task. Then they cancel, you have to delete and restart the entire process rather than just finding the next available tasker. Why wouldn’t you be able to edit a task if it hasn’t been accepted yet? The experience is completely broken. 😡</p>

      <p>I have used this app once, and that was more than enough. I suggest you look the other way before you waste time like me.

I recently hired tasker Kevin P. For truck assisted moving. He messaged me regarding the task, then proceeded to call me and started asking for a higher rate ($150) then what he listed. I refused and promised to tip him generously instead, then we agreed to meet at 4 pm today. He let me know he was 15 minutes away, then called me and said he will not do it, it is not worth it, and he is throwing his hands up. Mind you, it was 4:05pm when he called me, and I had already traveled an hour to the pick up place. I was extremely disappointed by the lack of professionalism, but it was even more infuriating to see that he was trying to manipulate the situation and made it seem like I canceled on him on the chat. This was my first time using taskrabbit, and will be the last time, due to sheer unprofessionalism and dishonesty from Kevin.

They need a better quality control on the people on the platform, as there are a lot of lying, dishonest, and fraudulent people on this app.</p>

He didn’t even bother reading the task description or message I clearly detailed I wanted tinted window film added to my single split window. The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film !

I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

      <p>I’ve used Task Rabbit in the past and had a good experience. However, when I booked this week to have some blinds installed, I unhappily discovered you could no longer choose your own Tasker. The first person assigned to me ghosted. The second person assigned is now 30+ minutes late and didn’t say anything until I reached out to ask if he was on his way when he hadn’t showed 15 minutes after the appointment. 

I honestly can’t remember what the minimums were previously and if they were set by the app or by individuals, but I’m now having to pay for 2 hours of work for a job that will for sure take leas than an hour. Can promise this is the last time I’ll use Task Rabbit.</p>

      <p>I’ve used Taskrabbit a dozen times in New York City and was just going to hire someone to mount some new shelves for me and just realized that there’s an update that doesn’t allow you to choose your own Tasker. What?? This is insane. The whole point of this app was being able to choose the person who worked best for you who had a profile, a photo, proof of experience, photos of their work, reviews, etc. Why would I just let some random person in my home that I haven’t vetted myself through communication on the app first? Why would I not be allowed to choose my own Tasker? I’ll never use this app again. Also, the rate that they’re charging for mounting is much lower than I paid before, which may sound like a good idea, but I used to pay way more than that to the people that I hired in the past to ensure that I was hiring qualified people. Why would those same people work for less now? Now I would be worried that only people with much less skills and experience are on the app now because I don’t know why those other people would stay. Taskrabbit is an app that connects you with people who have skills that you don’t. Clients aren’t dumb, we’re not just going to allow anyone in our home without being vetted first, and I absolutely don’t trust Taskrabbit to tell me who I’m supposed to feel comfortable and safe with my home. I want to see reviews from other people for that exact person, I want to see photos of the work that person has done. This is absolutely insane and I’ll never use this app again and will recommend that no one else does as well.</p>

      <p>Before this new update you used to be able
to choose from a set of available taskers in your area. You could see how many tasks the person had completed and what their reviews were. With this new update you cannot choose who will be your tasker. Instead you are randomly assigned a tasker with no ability to see what the options of other taskers are. Also paying all the taskers the same flat rate as opposed to allowing taskers to set their own rates is a disgusting way to treat workers. Somebody who has been a tasker for years with solid reviews should not be paid the same as a person who just started. Professionals should be able to adjust their rates to reflect their level of expertise. As a customer who values good work I would truly rather pay more for somebody with good reviews and experience than pay somebody that I got randomly assigned with no choice in the matter.</p>

I’m a single woman who lives alone and being able to personally select the person who enters my home is ESSENTIAL to me feeling safe. But now Taskrabbit rolled out an update that doesn’t allow the client to choose their own tasker. I’m not just going to pick a time and HOPE the person I scheduled isn’t a total creep. I have ZERO trust in this app anymore. Change it back to the way it was or all the single women like me who used to rely on this app will NOT be using it anymore for safety reasons. I hope another company develops a new handyman app with greater transparency. Taskrabbit is a joke.</p>

      <h4>Review of this terrible app. part 1, 1 stars (Andreya P., Apple App Store, 2024-08-09)</h4>
      <p>Review of this terrible app.

Hello everyone! I’d like to share my experience with this app and how it hasn’t paid me my wages for 4-5 months (from April 2024 to August 2024). I’ll also talk about other things that will drive you crazy. I worked as a cleaner through this app. I tried to register starting in February 2024, but only succeeded in April 2024. Why did it take so long? Because there were a million problems with the app, especially with the verification of personal documents, non-functioning buttons, and links that wouldn’t open. Every day, I had to communicate with the app’s support team. I wrote detailed explanations about how certain buttons wouldn’t click, some links wouldn’t open, and some functions didn’t work, etc. I tried calling, but the answering machine said they weren’t taking calls at that time, even though it was during business hours! The support staff were VERY SLOW AND UNENTHUSIASTIC in solving my issues and answering my questions. I suspect they were just sending templated responses without understanding the problem. They would only respond 1-2 days later, and after they did, they would give some introductory answer or ask some questions, and then immediately say, “Oh, it seems you got distracted from the conversation. Are you still there?” If I didn’t respond within an hour, they would close the conversation, and I would have to start all over again and wait for a response. According to their logic, I’m supposed to sit and wait, putting my life on hold, just to respond instantly when they finally reply. The idea of this app is great: clients can hire workers for any task, whether it’s a carpenter, gardener, or cleaner. But the implementation for people working through the app is terrible, and you can be sure it will take all your nerves. If there’s a sudden verification or change in personal information (such as Social Security Number), you are left without work and without pay.

When I finally managed to pass the verification, I was able to start working (April 2024). I took on many orders. After a month of working, I realized that not a single dollar had been credited to my bank account. Although the app showed that some money had already been sent to the bank and some was still in process, I received nothing. I contacted support again, and we discovered the reason: there was a mistake in my SSN. As the bank explained, when TaskRabbit sends money to my account, the bank automatically rejects it due to the name mismatch. However, my friend, who works for a different company, also has a mistake in his name, and he has never had any problems—money comes on time and regularly. He told me that the most important thing is the number matching. I was told I needed to change my SSN and update the information in my account, and then the money would be deposited into my account. I did just that. I went to the Social Security Administration and changed my SSN. I asked when it would be updated in your databases, and they said it would be the next day. They would send me a new document by mail in 2 weeks. I wrote all this to TaskRabbit support, explained it to them, and tried to update my account information. Every time, I encountered an error. When I entered my Social Security Number (numbers only) and clicked CONFIRM, the button wouldn’t work, and the field where I entered my SSN remained red. I wrote to support again, waited again, and explained every detail to make sure they understood correctly. But the problem still hasn’t been resolved. They initially sent me a link to upload my new SSN, but nothing happened and there was still an error. I wrote to support again, and they again said to wait. And no one ever tells you how long you need to wait—one week, one month, a year? You’re wasting your time and money while TaskRabbit figures out how to SIMPLY UPDATE INFORMATION in their system so that I can receive my pay and continue working on their platform. Recently, I called them with my boyfriend because he speaks English better than I do. First, there was a very long wait—4 or 5 hours before they answered the call. Second, when we finally got a response, the call quality was terrible, as if the man was speaking into his own nose. We explained everything to him, and he still didn’t resolve my problem and said to wait. In this case, after persistent questioning from my boyfriend, he finally said that I should receive an email confirming that my documents have been verified and this should happen within the week, from August 5th to August 11th. But today is already August 9th (Friday) and tomorrow is the weekend when people don’t work. And something tells me that my boyfriend and I will have to call them again and beg for some information and a resolution to my problem. I would just like them to give me my money for the work done and be done with it. I’m no longer sure I want to work there. Such breaks in work and receiving payment will make you bankrupt. You cannot rely on stable work and pay. And the most important thing is not the amount of work/orders, but the app and support service. When I worked, there was plenty of work, and orders were constant. But because of the terrible app performance, I didn’t receive any payment from clients for the work done. And that is very disappointing and awful. I’m still waiting for something, though I don’t even understand what.</p>

When I tried to look on the TR website about the fee, it also did not specify whether the fee was hourly or one-time.

I have been trying to get in touch with customer service, and I’ve been waiting in line for hours. They automatically ended my call after an hour saying that their customer support time has ended.

      <p>I have had problems with multiple taskers coming over and not completing the designated task. After the second time, I contacted Task Rabbit customer service about getting my money back because I ended up just having to pay another time to have a professional fix the issue. Customer service refunded me less than half of my payment and refused to entertain the idea of giving me any more of my money back despite the fact that the tasker spent an hour at my home and didn’t even begin to fix the problem. I love the idea of the app, but without good customer service, it’s worthless. With all of the service fees, I paid less for a professional who actually completed the job.</p>

As a customer I’m charged for last minute cancellation but task rabbit doesn’t provide the same courtesy back to customers — at least provide a discount if I reschedule the task.

I tried contacting task rabbit and finally got a hold of a live person (call back took 96 minutes). They told me this could only be resolved through emailing them. I emailed them and asked what to do. 
Meanwhile,the tasker kept harassing me (next day) and so I paid him because I was scared. Task Rabbit have done nothing to protect or help me. Their process is slow. After I emailed again explaining what happened, they said because I paid outside, they couldn’t help and would not take action for their tasker who was threatening me. 
The process is still ongoing. They should have emergency help available for a situation like this.</p>

      <p>1. Why are Taskers allowed to confirm a request if they know they are not available only for them to try to reschedule?

2. Why are they allowed quote me a new price WAY higher than the price  I’m shown prior to booking? this should not be allowed and it is not fair. It is a waste of time.

3. Why is a Tasker allowed to quote me a higher rate than what I initially see when booking due to the fact that they “say they need to hire a helper, or they require a two hour minimum” even though it is not shown in their profile? Again, this practice should not be allowed. It is a waste of time. Everything should be shown in a final quote PRIOR to confirming a task.

4. Tasker often cancel at the last minute when I don’t meet their demands for additional fees and this is inconvenient. They should be held accountable or charged for cancelling unnecessarily.</p>

Your app is not great…. There needs to be soo much done. I feel like anyone can be a tasker and that’s not ok. There should be strict processes before having anyone sign up. 

Also stop scamming people by charging such high fees. Be upfront about prices between taskers. And really get some actual professional.

      <p>I’ve consistently had terrible experiences getting a hold of anyone in support when my unreliable taskers either cancel or don’t show up on. It’s fascinating that someone can cancel on you literally minutes before your appointment w/ no comment/message and your chat history just either disappears so you can’t even keep a log of the terrible person for future reference, you definitely have no way to rate them for their unreliability (so … what’s the point of hiring someone based on reviews when they are skewed) NOR is it possible for you to write them directly to share your disappointment. 
This is now my second experience within the same 2 week window (one a few months ago) where both people confirmed, then waited until the last minute to cancel w/out even a courtesy message. 
One literally wasted a week chatting asking for photos, details only for him to say - “great, see you in an hour”  then poof - magically disappears. 

Customer service does not exist.

He did not complete the task, and I finally had to send him home. Did I mention he was two hours late? This is a guy who had 50 “reviews” and a 4.9 star rating.  I have absolutely no faith in Task Rabbit after this experience.</p>

The second rescheduled for another day and then cancelled 10 minutes before my appointment.  All this app did was waste my time and leave me annoyed, much like my ex-husband.</p>

I’m reserving my busy schedule for a service and I plan my day around it. And then they cancel last minute. Sometimes they try to offer a replacement, in this case that was someone with no reviews yet. No thanks. Task rabbit needs to find a way to make this app more useable and not waste everyone’s time. You’ve lost a customer that you never even had in the first place because not one, two, but three times my tasks were cancelled. Cleaning and yard work that never happened. What a joke</p>

Conclusion: if the wrong person comes to you and steals/causes damage/robs something, in this case you will have to solve this problem yourself!

      <p>I had a sink full of dishes but most of them had already been pre-soaked and sprayed with water - only needed light scrubbing. I asked her to do the dishes, clean kitchen floor, clean ice machine, vacuum, and clean my bathroom tub. She spend FIVE hours in my apartment and only did the dishes (which almost all still have spots), wiped kitchen counters and floors, and attempted to vacuum for 20min. I’m not sure what her issue was with my vacuum, it is a nice Eureka $160 vacuum that works excellent for me. I told her to let me know if she was hungry since  5 hours is a long time, and I’ll give her a granola bar or chips. I left my apartment for about 15min, came back, and she had gotten into my freezer and helped herself to my vegan nuggets and cherry tomatoes; my only frozen dinner. I do not understand why she didn’t ask first? Then she used my dishes for the food she helped herself to and didn’t even clean it up (I have disposable plates and utensils, I don’t understand why she didn’t use that if she didn’t want to clean up after herself). The photos I sent were the mess she left. Also, I have bottled water and seltzer water in my fridge which I actually told her she could help herself to if she was thirsty, however, she didn’t clean that up after herself either. She left her two half drank water bottles on my kitchen counter. She convinced me I’d save money by paying her under the table through cash app (I included the screenshot of the payment). I payed over $200 for this. I am so incredibly disappointed.</p>

      <p>I had this tasker give me his private phone number through the app. He wanted the $ off the app & told me it would be cheaper without the app fees. I said no so he cancelled my task. I let Task Rabbit know showed them the messages with his private number & they brushed it off. I’ve used the app before & never had a problem but knowing the company does nothing about scamming taskers is kind of scary going forward trusting the app/company with strangers having your home address etc.</p>

      <p>I highly recommend Mykola for any handyman services you may need. He arrived promptly, demonstrating excellent professionalism from the start. Equipped with a wide array of tools and fully prepared for the task at hand, he wasted no time getting to work. To my surprise, Mykola completed the job in a fraction of the time that another handyman had estimated it would take. His prompt and effective service not only saved me precious time and money, but also alleviated any unnecessary stress. Given the exceptional quality of his work, I believe he deserves more than just a standard tip. Had I opted for a different handyman, I would have likely incurred double the expenses and wasted valuable time.

Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend Mykola's services to anyone in need.With Mykola, you can trust that your project will be in good hands every time. He is a true professional with relieble and an unmatched skill set, and I am immensely grateful for his invaluable assistance.</p>

      <h4>Horrible experience!, 1 stars (ER Doc 916, Apple App Store, 2024-04-13)</h4>
      <p>DO NOT USE! The app, ease of use etc seemed ok at first. Selected a tasker who had multiple 5-star reviews with “minimal instruction required” etc written in the comments. He showed up hours late, seemed to not have slept at all, pale, fatigued, excoriations on his face (he looked like a drug user). My interaction with him seemed ok, and coupled with the good reviews I figured I could leave him unattended to clean and organize the garage. Had the worse experience. He made an unauthorized trip to Home Depot, unauthorized purchases there as well that he “needed” for the task. He submitted a false number of hours. The task was not complete at all, in fact my garage was worse than before. With damage to the wall and missing items. Screws and bolts on the ground. A bike pulley system anchored to the bench press. The attic door unhinged (what was he doing in the attic??) . So far TaskRabbit offered a couple hours compensation for someone to come complete the task , but not offering refund. I refused that petty resolution because I wouldn’t trust a tasker in my home again despite their reported background check. They’ve already charged my credit card for the unauthorized purchases, trip to Home Depot and false hours the tasker put on then invoice. In addition, the tasker said payment is through PayPal. This was my first (and now last) use of TaskRabbit so I made the mistake of paying him through PayPal - so now I’m out 2x. Planning to reverse the charge with my credit card company because TR doesn’t seem to care to make things right. DO NOT RECOMMEND.</p>

      <p>I used the app to schedule a move to an apartment two weeks in advance. Then, less than 24 hours before the move, the “Tasker” canceled my service without a reason or warning. I was left with a bunch of furniture to figure out how to move by myself in a day, on a holiday weekend, no less. 

Resolving the issue was impossible on such short notice, and the app does not allow you to communicate with nor review a “Tasker” if they cancel. 

I went against my better judgement after friends warned me about the app. I wish I had just hired outside the app to begin with.</p>

      <p>I’ve had great taskers, but I’ve also hired way too many unreliable taskers who cancelled at the last minute without so much as a “sorry.” There’s zero accountability. You can’t even give a tasker a low rating to warn other customers about their unreliability because once they cancel the app no longer gives you access to leave a review. Sometimes you get lucky and the person you hire turns out to be excellent, but it’s a gamble every time.</p>

      <h4>TaskRabbit: Where Reliability Takes a Vacation and Never Returns, 1 stars (mihoutaowww, Apple App Store, 2024-03-23)</h4>
      <p>TaskRabbit, the epitome of unprofessionalism and unreliability. If you're looking for a service that will consistently disappoint and leave you high and dry, look no further.
My experience with TaskRabbit has been an exercise in frustration and wasted time. Three times, I've scheduled cleaning services through their platform, and three times, I've been left scrambling at the last minute because the maid decided she had better things to do.
It's bad enough to have your plans thrown into disarray by a cancellation, but what's truly maddening is the complete lack of consequences for these flaky maids. They can bail on appointments with impunity, leaving customers like me in the lurch, and TaskRabbit doesn't bat an eyelash.
And don't even get me started on TaskRabbit's customer service – or lack thereof. When I reached out for assistance after yet another cancellation, I was met with nothing but indifference and excuses. It's clear they have no interest in actually helping their customers or holding their so-called "taskers" accountable.
TaskRabbit's motto should be "We'll be there for you... until we're not." Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this sham of a service. There are plenty of other platforms out there that actually value their customers' time and deserve their hard-earned money. TaskRabbit isn't one of them.</p>

My Tasker was communicative, friendly, and did a good enough job that I’ll have her back next week. 

I was very surprised that the Tasker was able to add on an extra hour without my approval. She did the work; I’m not saying she didn’t deserve the pay. But there should be some sort of approval from me (whether or not I’d like the extra hour of work or if I’d like for her to stop working because I only approved 1.5hrs).

Other than that, it was a good experience.</p>

      <h4>Exploitative ‘minimum hour’ practice, 1 stars (Dara U., Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</h4>
      <p>My tasker did a ~10 minute job and I was charged for 2hrs worth of work because of his 2hr minimum. To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least. I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. 
(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue. They have no vested interest in customer retention. Dont waste your time)
Don’t even get me started on a ~30% added support fee PER HOUR! Go to a professional company or local handyman, don’t use this app—at least your money would be worth it.</p>

      <h4>BEWARE! Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars (Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)</h4>
      <p>I recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping "Trust & Support Fee" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.</p>

      <h4>Horrible Do Not Recommend, 1 stars (T. Michael, Apple App Store, 2024-03-03)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded the app all because a coworker of mine used it and had a good experience. I tried it for my self. I was moving and thought I would save a little and book them. 
I booked 3 different times and all canceled on me within ours. Finally booked with Andre and he said he would be there In the morning at the time I chose at 9:30am. The morning of the move he texted in the app and said he would be runing late. We agreed on Noon, but nothing later because I had another appointment at the New apartment at 2pm. At 12:30 he texted saying he is 45 mins away. At 1:30 no answer. 2pm no answer. 2:30pm no answer. 3pm no answer and I had it. I canceled the trip after hours of being late with no response. Completely unprofessional and horrible communication. I then deleted the app and wrote to the company. I don’t recommend them at all. Their response was a $25 credit to the next task. Give me a break!You get what you pay for in the end. Hire professionals plain and simple!</p>

      <p>I have used TaskRabbit countless times through the years for all kinds of projects and found great workers, also some less great workers. I wish there was a way to sort my past taskers by city as I often hire people for projects around the country. I often need multiple taskers for a single project and there is no option to do that without creating a bunch of individual projects. I also wish I could contact past taskers who are no longer available on the app to hire them for projects</p>

      <p>Task Rabbit needs to do a better job of preventing a Tasker from simply “Ghosting” a job. What do I mean? They can accept the job, agree to arrival times, then simply not show, text, or call and the customer has very little recourse. Task Rabbit needs to think through this so a hiring party can rate the “NO SHOW” or “Cancel” w an edit to update if it’s made right but the worker should face some consequence in ratings not just an unseen “CANCEL” as the only job option and those of hiring are entitled to know if they have a lot of “No Shows” or “Cancels” their past. This is critical knowledge!! I know I’d use it as a measure of reliability and you should provide it!!</p>

The only way around this is to delete the entire app and reinstall it.  It’s truly so annoying that most of the time I end up just changing my mind and not booking a Tasker.

      <h4>What was I thinking, 1 stars (Poke you, Apple App Store, 2024-02-01)</h4>
      <p>I don’t know what I was thinking using this app I read some of the reviews and I said OK let me give it a try. First Tasker was elite Tasker, so I had high expectations high standards.. the reviews were stellar, this tasker canceled on me, if anyone knows me, I plan I am detail oriented and when a game plan in place for anything I schedule. The task failed to communicate to me that her current job she was working on got pushed back so that means she wouldn’t have gotten to me until about 930pm 
So I had to keep it moving, but I said hey second chances, let me give him a try, the customer service gave me a $35 credit so I said why not, second tasker was second and highest rating with good reviews. People if I show you the pictures of the mess that was left in my house little girl was not even worth the money she’s charging.

I’ve put in two calls today to Taskrabbit responded to their email with the photos to make very clear I will not be paying anyone any money. 

The only good thing out of this process was the customer service reps, attempting and trying to help other than that I will not be using this app again</p>

      <h4>ROBBED & VANDALIZED BY THE APP & MY TASKER, 1 stars (Kaydouble, Apple App Store, 2024-01-26)</h4>
      <p>The tasker robbed me and vandalized my property and they only offered me $200 in app credit and $50 in cash. Over $1,000 in damages and support blamed majority of it on me for hiring that tasker. BEWARE of the app, they harbor criminals and blame you for using the app. I don’t have cameras inside my home so since I can’t prove they did it support can not help me. They only gave me a credit for the things I could “prove” but the Tasker had to agree otherwise they deemed it unusable evidence. I’m sure some people have great reviews if they didn’t get assigned a thief, a rapist or anything of the likes. They claim all they do is run a background check if it’s good they can do whatever to you. Lastly, they make you pay a happiness fee, meaning if something goes wrong they will pay you up to $10,000. I wasn’t even asking for a fraction of that and I was denied. Please BEWARE of you get Scout as your support person, he is an accessor or accessory to criminals and their actions. He pretends to care in the beginning and at the end he robs you too of your dignity for using the FRAUDULENT app. Upon request I will post the Taskers name. Please BEWARE and be SAFE. This man could hurt me he knows where I live and I’m a woman who lives alone. I’m scared for my safety. My task was January 6, 2023 and 20 days later and several emails and mountains of documentation I was denied and not really given a explanation as to why and now the Tasker knows I reported him and can come back to finish the job. My apologies for this being long, I just feel I need to save someone from this happening to them.</p>

Immediately there is a trust and support fee for $20 which I guess is just TaskRabbit's way of collecting their fees. I booked it for an hour. The guy came for less than 15 minutes and then charged me for 90 minutes. 

So now the Tv that I could’ve put up myself has cost me $130. I have contacted Task Rabbit. Nothing .</p>

      <p>I ordered a tasker through this app months ago and received a notice that my payment wasn’t working. This was strange because I never had issues before, but I tried to follow their flow to update my payment method to different credit cards several times. The flow was buggy and it wouldn’t fix anything. I was blocked from using the app for months even though I tried contacting support.

I was finally unblocked after reaching out to support again, but I feel bad that my tasker was unpaid for such a small task for months. Terrible experience. The support team also did not explain why the issue came up on my account. I was told my payment method seemed fine. They just manually approved my invoice. Buggy app</p>

      <p>Both taskers and support staff can be vastly unreliable; however, in the midst of multiple chaotic situations where two taskers in a row canceled on me literally at the last second for a help moving job and I couldn’t get anyone to answer me on the customer support live chat, I was finally able to get some help from a good tasker and a decent customer service representative on the phone (after having to call and sit on hold, while still being ignored on the live chat.) The following day for a different task, a studio apartment cleaning, the tasker showed up hours late, then took several hours to complete a job, during which she had to leave and come back. She did not finish until after midnight, though ultimately she did a good job. Communication from taskers is poor. Not sure I’ll use this app again.</p>

      <p>This app has helped me several times to get started on projects that I have been dreading around my house. The first time you tackle home repairs is so daunting but if you have a helper who knows where to start it makes all the difference! Thanks for connecting me with some great helpers!</p>

      <h4>Finicky and unresponsive app, 2 stars (DubbleNJenn, Apple App Store, 2023-12-06)</h4>
      <p>I found this app to be incredibly difficult to use. It took five times longer to complete the transactions that I needed to hire the Tasker because functions kept failing, and I had to keep going back to prior pages to start over. There are points where the page will not allow you to continue, despite having populated all the fields. I do not like the fact that the tipping is only enabled for 24 hours after receipt of the invoice. There is no option to add photos to the review of my Tasker.</p>

      <h4>Junk, 1 stars (///M5er, Apple App Store, 2023-12-05)</h4>
      <p>Can’t contact a tasker. You have to go through the entire process and on top of it you must add a credit card to their app and who knows how secure it is and THEN it will allow you to basically hire the person and chat with them. What if I want to contact several? It’s like it was designed by someone mentally challenged and can’t see all the use cases. Also their support fee is hourly… remove my info from your platform.</p>

      <p>It is a 30/70 chance that clicking on a tasker’s “reviews” section will actually lead you to the reviews. Most of the time it will redirect you to make a booking instead. I have had the app for 3 years and have only been able to click in to read the reviews reliably a dozen times. Just need to hope it randomly works</p>

      <h4>Task Rabbit is a good option if you’re desperate, 2 stars (Laura 8709, Apple App Store, 2023-12-03)</h4>
      <p>I recommend always selecting Elite Taskers even if they cost more. I have booked quite a few tasks through this platform and experienced issues ranging from 1) poorly handled jobs to 2) Taskers who fail to show up on time and are unreachable by phone or text to 3) poor communication skills. I am grateful, at least, that Task Rabbit support has always resolved disputes easily for me. 
However, since a job that ended in a no show is considered “cancelled” there’s no way to leave a Tasker a bad review. Keep in mind that reviews may not tell the whole story about a Tasker and their level of professionalism.</p>

      <h4>ONE OF THE BEST HANDYMEN EVER! Amazing!, 5 stars (FancyFrancy77, Apple App Store, 2023-12-02)</h4>
      <p>Chad came last minute and did an excellent job on a piece that I needed done for the next day. I didn’t think I had a shot at getting anyone, but he stepped up to the plate and was so knowledgeable and putting the piece together and was kind and trustworthy. I would highly recommend him to anyone, he is way better than some of the people on here that I paid almost triple the amount to do a similar project. His price is more than fair ( I’m still pinching myself )he knows a lot about furniture assembly, computers, TVs, and the proper way to hang things.  He was beyond superior and I have already had family members ask me for his number. He is a gentleman and a 5th generation Texas nonetheless. If you are lucky enough to get him, you will see how intelligent, fast and professional he is.</p>
