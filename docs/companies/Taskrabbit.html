        <h1>About Taskrabbit</h1>
<p>Taskrabbit is a marketplace platform that connects individuals needing assistance with local "Taskers" who provide various services.

<h2>Negative Sentiment about Taskrabbit</h2>
<h3>App Performance Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love the service itself, but this app is so bad. It’s slow, I had to enter my new address multiple times for takers to show up, it uses Apple Pay but doesn’t let you swap out old Apple Pay cards." <a href="https://apple/11898486304">(Natalie A., Apple App Store, 2024-11-01)</a></li>
<li>"I've never had more trouble with an app than this one. The app only worked the first time I downloaded it and now I can't access my profile." <a href="https://google_play/d0b04c3c-df04-4249-a36c-5478d73b58da">(Andrew Paul, Google Play Store, 2024-11-06)</a></li>

<li>"The app doesn't load at all and I'm not able to use it. I have Android." <a href="https://google_play/617ff042-07f8-4bd2-8f47-d06a0ab658f2">(Harry Shawyer, Google Play Store, 2024-12-07)</a></li>
<li>"The last update changed the meaning of the application beyond recognition.

</ul>
<h3>Service Reliability Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It happened twice already. I waited and nobody came, and only when I open the app I saw the tasker rejected my job." <a href="https://apple/11323767889">(Lanyizhao, Apple App Store, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"Taskers can cancel jobs the day of your appointment and task rabbit doesn’t assist with finding a new person." <a href="https://apple/12111951105">(Don’t Use. 2, Apple App Store, 2024-12-27)</a></li>

<li>"Scheduled three separate tasks, and despite the fact that they say that the Tasker will write back within an hour, I never received a single response from a single Tasker." <a href="https://apple/11357209667">(JAGDan, Apple App Store, 2024-06-08)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing and Fees Concerns</h3>
<ul>

<li>"The only thing I will say is that their fees are now around 35% of the hourly rate you pay the tasker, and you’re still expected to tip on top of that, so it definitely gets expensive quickly." <a href="https://apple/11171473581">(NikkiLynn2986, Apple App Store, 2024-04-17)</a></li>
<li>"They charge a protection/service fee every hour alongside the tasked fee increasing the bill tremendously." <a href="https://apple/11629441670">(jujugurl98, Apple App Store, 2024-08-19)</a></li>
<li>"Just stated using TaskRabbit. Thought the hourly rate I saw reasonable for the work I wanted done. Then came the invoice with added administrative charges that bumped costs up 40%. I feel quite burned by the experience." <a href="https://apple/11954152509">(Wombat Bob, Apple App Store, 2024-11-15)</a></li>
<li>"The added fees are a ripoff. An extra $20 PER HOUR! is ridiculous." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/lvwcynl/">(Advanced_Cod_8929, Reddit, 2024-11-07)</a></li>

<li>"TaskRabbit does criminal background checks, but that’s it. No skill testing, etc. So how good the tasker will be varies widely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/1de6i0s/is_taskrabbit_any_goodbe_honest/l89rlki/">(Tasker2Tasker, Reddit, 2024-06-12)</a></li>
<li>"They gather all your information first and waste your time before telling you about the fee. They make you to pay a membership fee to work, sounds like a pretty skeevy outfit tbh." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/txsvfh/just_learned_of_task_rabbit_how_is_it_from_a/jjkrpjm/">(Silly_Slice_4119, Reddit, 2023-05-10)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Tasker Performance</h3>
<ul>

      <p>Giving it two stars because the functionality works, but the way the service is set up is awful. You have to pay for a job in order to ask any questions. In my case I waited so long for responses back from the tasker that the 24 hr period for free cancelation was over. So I had to ask the Tasker to cancel on his end in order for me not to be charged the full amount (it was a 1 hr job). So awkward, and unfair to both of us. Why do they do it this way? I won't be using this service again no thanks</p>

      <p>I don't understand why IKEA continues to refer Task Rabbit to clients. Task Rabbit staff will grab a booking just so they can secure a job that the client has paid for in advance at IKEA. Then the Task Rabbit Tasker will try to rebook the appointment, sometimes numerous times. Additionally, Task Rabbit doesn't recognize 'old' passwords so a client will have to register a new P/W. If the client does not do so, the client can not communicate w/ the Tasker.</p>

No cancellation confirmation or call was received from their end. Just a cancelled message. Their is no guarantee that if you have spare some time from your busy schedule for a tasker, then he/she will surely come or not. Taskrabbit will not inform you. No new tasker was assigned. Now I have to wait more as their is no near future appointments available.</p>

      <p>1. The app is extremely slow to start up. Takes literally seven seconds to get past the blank screen (on Pixel 8 Pro running latest Android). 2. Task's fee is not shown until after you pay for a task. Seems illegal. 3. Tasks don't have a status. Eg. my task has been completed, half a day later, still don't know what it'll cost me (what tasker reported) and the task status (if such thing exists) hasn't changed at all.</p>

      <p>The App is ok. Definitely needs Improvement as it's quite laggy and navigation is cumbersome. Booked two Taskers within days of each other; First Tasker cancelled in the late/early hours of the day that he had agreed to come and do the task. Second Tasker was adamant that I cancel the Job on the app and work offline before he accepted to start the Job. Never heard from him again. I've proceeded with a rival app and im rueing not using it in the first instance. I just hit the uninstall button.</p>

      <p>Indeed, it's a phishing business! It takes a lot to find a tasker on the app, and if you find one, they demand a huge amount of money and long hours of work for a small task. And then if you cancel them, they will charge you for the cancellation. So this is a win-win play for the TaskRabbit robbers and a big loss for the customer. Also, forget about customer service; they don't help you at all.</p>

      <p>My tasker did a ~10 minute job and I was charged for 2hrs worth of work because of his 2hr minimum. To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least. I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. 
(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue. They have no vested interest in customer retention. Dont waste your time)
Don’t even get me started on a ~30% added support fee PER HOUR! Go to a professional company or local handyman, don’t use this app—at least your money would be worth it.</p>

      <p>I have used this app once, and that was more than enough. I suggest you look the other way before you waste time like me.

I recently hired tasker Kevin P. For truck assisted moving. He messaged me regarding the task, then proceeded to call me and started asking for a higher rate ($150) then what he listed. I refused and promised to tip him generously instead, then we agreed to meet at 4 pm today. He let me know he was 15 minutes away, then called me and said he will not do it, it is not worth it, and he is throwing his hands up. Mind you, it was 4:05pm when he called me, and I had already traveled an hour to the pick up place. I was extremely disappointed by the lack of professionalism, but it was even more infuriating to see that he was trying to manipulate the situation and made it seem like I canceled on him on the chat. This was my first time using taskrabbit, and will be the last time, due to sheer unprofessionalism and dishonesty from Kevin.

They need a better quality control on the people on the platform, as there are a lot of lying, dishonest, and fraudulent people on this app.</p>

      <p>I’ve come across two technical issues when using this app for the past week. 

1. When I’m browsing though the list of professionals, you can compare their hourly rate. the summary page before booking shows an entirely different rate. I thought the tasker I selected just had unexplained hidden fees, but when I tried to book another professional, it shows the same unexplained rate. It’s not until you commit to booking that it shows the accurate rate from the browse page. 

2. When I rescheduled an appointment for 4pm through the app, it sent a message to the tasker that I rescheduled for 2pm. 

The technical issues are small, but they can have a huge impact. They can lead to miscommunication around price and timing of the appointment, which are the most important features of the app in my opinion</p>

      <p>Was looking for lawn maintenance & found someone who looked good & had a reasonable rate. When I booked, I saw a “trust & support fee” that was unclear if it was hourly or one-time, it was about $20 compared to the tasker’s hourly rate of about $40. When I tried to look on the TR website about the fee, it also did not specify whether the fee was hourly or one-time. A quick google search confirmed that this is an HOURLY fee on top of the tasker’s hourly rate making my potential lawn guy about $77/hour. Unfortunately I ended up canceling the job and deleting the app. This additional fee just makes all of their taskers too expensive.</p>

      <h4>BEWARE! Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars (Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)</h4>
      <p>I recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping "Trust & Support Fee" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.</p>

      <p>They charge a protection/service fee every hour alongside the tasked fee increasing the bill tremendously as they set it at a % they determine I believe is between 15-10% my last service with task rabbit will be my last as I’m uninstalling the app. The fee was like an additional $10+ on top of the service man’s fee of $40+ the man wasn’t experienced in the work he was doing. He didn’t even bother reading the task description or message I clearly detailed I wanted tinted window film added to my single split window. The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

      <h4>Risky to develop business on the platform, 1 stars (Minormajor, Apple App Store, 2024-12-15)</h4>
      <p>I worked Task Rabbit gigs for 2 years. I kept my rating at 4.7, with over 100 jobs completed.

There’s plenty of issues with the app. But my issue is with the freedom the platform gives clients to lie about services rendered, resulting in a discount or a complete deactivation of the Tasker. I was accused of doing something I didn’t do. By a clients partner, who didn’t contact me through Tasker. But because my client had at one point contacted me through the platform, they were able to concoct a crazy story about our interaction, and falsely accuse me of things they couldn’t prove.

Without considering the motives of the client (primarily a full refund, as that’s what they had told me they had done in the past with other contracting situations), the moderation team paused my account for a month. And then told me I was deactivated.

The reason? Beats me. But the platform doesn’t care about the professionals performing services at all. We are expendable. And trying to develop a business or positive rating on the platform is always at risk of being nulled by a disgruntled customer looking for free work. 

I’ve reported Task Rabbit to the BBB. But so have hundreds of others. Unfortunately, the platform doesn’t just not care about the Taskers—
But also, its reputation. 

Would never recommend this app to anyone trying to do good work for people. There will be class action lawsuits on both sides of the table, from clients and Taskers alike.</p>

as a former tech advisor I wonder how anyone gets anything done on these dysfunctional apps. this interface is so bad I couldn’t even get signed in because it wanted me to enter a code on a blank screen and hit verify which was greyed out until the code was entered… tried to send the code again since nothing was showing up from messages and it says it’s too soon… finally realize this barely perceptible light grey smudge of a line (which i had previously tapped) is where I should enter it, gets me in, can’t get through booking since continue is covered by predictive text, okay move that, still unresponsive… no curtains for me!

On iphone - managed to make it through the scheduling process, where it successfully booked me with someone without showing me their profile or any other taskers to consider. i see nothing about what i requested in their profile. Great.</p>

I know there are plenty of people with an eye for putting together outfits. I found your Wardrobe Assembly category, but it was about putting furniture together and had nothing to do with clothing! 

It would also be really nice to have a longer list of tasks somewhere. For example, by entering random words I found out that I can hire people for Event Planning or Senior Care. I wouldn’t have even guessed either one. (And I could have used one of them in the past.)</p>

      <p>The last update changed the meaning of the application beyond recognition. If earlier I could personally choose Tasker based on my preferences, choose by reviews, availability and photos, now the application offers to choose a performer for me. Guys, stop running after the AI agenda. Leave the opportunity for people to choose people!!!

P.S.

I've been a task rabbit client for more than a year! Made repairs in almost all rooms through this application. But what's happening now makes me look on YELP...</p>

      <h4>Taskers cancel at last minute, 1 stars (Taylor S.Wift, Apple App Store, 2024-02-20)</h4>
      <p>Trying to hire two cleaners for home

The first task are hired canceled at the last minute and then rescheduled and canceled the second time. Gerado G was his name

The second one had a job and was running late. She has to be seen two hours later, which was inconvenient and inconsiderate.  Her name is Cerene w

I’m leaving my review here because you can’t leave a review unless you’re hired these people.  I hope Taskrabbit can do something about their accountability.</p>

      <p>This app used to give you options to choose your tasker and gave an bio on the tasker to ensure needs were met. Now the app claims you get to select a tasker but it’s automatically selected based off of their recommendations. Their recommendations seemed bias and not based off of customer reviews and experience. Will not be using again until this feature is corrected.</p>

      <h4>Late show/ No show, 1 stars (CBN304, Apple App Store, 2024-02-19)</h4>
      <p>Task Rabbit needs to do a better job of preventing a Tasker from simply “Ghosting” a job. What do I mean? They can accept the job, agree to arrival times, then simply not show, text, or call and the customer has very little recourse. Task Rabbit needs to think through this so a hiring party can rate the “NO SHOW” or “Cancel” w an edit to update if it’s made right but the worker should face some consequence in ratings not just an unseen “CANCEL” as the only job option and those of hiring are entitled to know if they have a lot of “No Shows” or “Cancels” their past. This is critical knowledge!! I know I’d use it as a measure of reliability and you should provide it!!</p>

      <p>Highly recommend that you satay away from this app. Tasker completed 3.75h task, but billed for 5h, because this was documented in chat section of app, I requested a refund which the company promised to issue, but never did. Hiring anyone on this app is like signing a blank check for this company to charge you whatever they want regardless of what services are actually provided. Use at your own risk!</p>

      <h4>Incompetent “help” by unscreened “taskers”, 1 stars (Karhart, Apple App Store, 2024-06-04)</h4>
      <p>I just needed someone to spend an hour creating a little bracket to hold my AC in the window to prevent it from falling. Other than that, I just needed the person to hoist the AC up there. What I got was three hours of a guy sawing 2x4’s IN MY LIVINGROOM, sending sawdust throughout the house, then screwing and unscrewing the same few pieces of random-length wood into my window for 3 hours. He did not complete the task, and I finally had to send him home. Did I mention he was two hours late? This is a guy who had 50 “reviews” and a 4.9 star rating.  I have absolutely no faith in Task Rabbit after this experience.</p>

      <h4>I GOT ROBBED & customer service did nothing, 1 stars (sunshinedaylight, Apple App Store, 2024-08-17)</h4>
      <p>I recently moved to a new state and needed assistance with mounting and assembling furniture, so I hired someone for two days. Unfortunately, the individual lacked the necessary skills, resulting in significant damage to five walls and improper installation of several items. Additionally, the worker only spoke Russian, which was not indicated on the app, leading to a frustrating language barrier.

To make matters worse, I discovered that the worker had stolen some of our tech including my boyfriend’s PS5 gaming accessories, controllers and cables. The worker had access to a room with covered boxes and took advantage of our absence to go through our belongings.

I contacted customer service immediately, and they promised a response within two days, but never followed through. When I tried to follow up, my ticket was closed without resolution. Despite submitting a new ticket, I have not received any reply, and it has now been over a week with no progress.</p>

      <p>Every task rabbit I’ve had has been inexplicably sluggish and incoherent. One woman I swore I’d never hire again appeared at my door. I was mystified but eventually realized she is using a false profile photo. I gave her a second chance and explained to her the organization that was needed to be done. No cleaning, just organizing. When I finished, she put her bag down, grabbed the windex and headed for the bathroom. I canceled the appointment right there.</p>

      <h4>Your App is a Curse, 1 stars (Ms. B77, Apple App Store, 2024-06-14)</h4>
      <p>There are so many apps out there that are bad and I may be overdoing it with this one. But I’ve had 2-3 tasker fall outs. 

I didn’t know cancellation fees were high and the taskers ask for money plus the Taskrabbit  price. Some don’t this but others really go out there way to add extra prices on top of everything we’re paying for. 

Your app is not great…. There needs to be soo much done. I feel like anyone can be a tasker and that’s not ok. There should be strict processes before having anyone sign up. 

Also stop scamming people by charging such high fees. Be upfront about prices between taskers. And really get some actual professional.

I’m thankful for one tasker that was above and beyond but that’s just it. It stops there.</p>
