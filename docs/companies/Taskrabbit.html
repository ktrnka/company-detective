        <h1>About Taskrabbit</h1>
<p>Taskrabbit, founded on January 1, 2008, by Leah Busque, is a platform that connects individuals with local freelancers, known as "Taskers," who can assist with various tasks. The company was acquired by IKEA in 2017, which has influenced its focus on home-related services, particularly furniture assembly and moving tasks <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. Taskrabbit operates in thousands of cities across nine countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit's primary product is its online platform, which facilitates the connection between Taskers and customers. Users can book services through the website or app, often with same-day availability. The platform operates as a two-sided marketplace, where clients can post tasks and Taskers can accept them. Taskers are independent contractors who set their own rates and schedules, providing services under their own names rather than Taskrabbit's brand <a href="https://support.taskrabbit.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008913792-Taskrabbit-Global-Terms-of-Service">(Taskrabbit Global Terms of Service, 2024-02-21)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit serves a diverse customer base, including individuals needing help with everyday tasks and small businesses looking for assistance. The platform is designed to cater to various needs, making it a versatile solution for many. The company generates revenue by taking a percentage of the fees paid to Taskers for their services, operating primarily in a B2C model.</p>
<p>The company has been recognized for its workplace culture, being honored in Built In’s 2024 Best Places To Work Awards for the third consecutive year <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/taskrabbit-news">(Taskrabbit Blog, 2024-06-11)</a>. Taskrabbit promotes a culture of safety, reliability, and community support, encouraging Taskers and customers to follow public health guidelines, especially during the pandemic.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Ania Smith has been the CEO of Taskrabbit since August 2020. She has emphasized the importance of flexibility and autonomy for Taskers, highlighting the platform's role in providing meaningful income opportunities <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/04/07/taskrabbit-ceo-talks-about-the-evolution-of-gig-economy-companies/">(Poinski, Forbes, 2024-04-07)</a>.

<h2>Market Position and Competitors</h2>
<p>Taskrabbit operates in a competitive landscape with several alternatives, including Handy, Thumbtack, and Care.com.

Taskrabbit's unique positioning as a platform for quick, flexible tasks, particularly in the home improvement sector, allows it to maintain a distinct market presence.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Taskrabbit has established itself as a leader in the gig economy, particularly in the home services sector. With a focus on enhancing the Tasker experience, expanding service offerings, and forming strategic partnerships, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Taskrabbit's innovative approach to the gig economy and its commitment to supporting its workforce as key factors in its ongoing success.</p>

      <p>The fees that Taskrabbit adds to the Taskers' rate is extremely high. I did not know of the fee (and just how high it was) before enrolling my task and searching for taskers. For that reason it is highly unlikely I will be using this app again. I would not recommend this service.</p>

      <p>Customer service is terrible. as an act of good faith, they gave me a $45 credit. I emailed multiple times saying I didn't see the credit before booking again. they insisted it's there. The credit was never there! After I booked a second time, and was charged the full amount, they then gave me a credit in my account to use on a "future service". customer service is lying and giving me the runaround while I keep asking for the $45. I'm contacting my bank to get my $45!!!! y'all are a SCAM.</p>

I was being charged, even though he was out buying tools he should of already had, I paid $200 for this foul person, on he destroyed the door, made the screw holes bigger, due to him not knowing what screw goes where.

      <p>App works good but beware. If somebody charges you for 22 hours when they only worked 2 hours you have to fight to get a refund and then they won't even refund you all the money. They refunded me like 60% of it. So for a 2-hour job it still is going to charge me over $160. Plus the horrible tasker wanted to be paid through PayPal so an additional $450 was taken for this 2-hour job. Never again. Just don't use</p>

      <p>They constantly lower prices they pay to their taskers. Expecting someone to drive out to somebodies house and build a wardobe for £22 on a self employed basis They are now taking 60+% of the price the client is paying on IKEA flat rate. They claim we're self employed and can choose our work but they penalise you for refusing to work at these rates and ban you from the platform. How is that choosing your own work ? Ontop of that the support is absolutely useless. Avoid at all costs</p>

They have one interface but two back ends. To figure it out you have to change both passwords. This is the type of IT that makes people do things the wrong way</p>

      <p>Horrible for Ikea furniture assembly. Two guys with outstanding reviews came, they fooled us into paying more than what Ikea budgeted. The job is a disaster, plenty of scratches and wholes in places where there shouldn't be. One tasker blames the other, no customer service has contacted us, we just lost 400€ and no one cares</p>

      <p>I've never had more trouble with an app than this one. The app only worked the first time I downloaded it and now I can't access my profile. It would constantly load,but never connect even though I'm on Wi-Fi with a strong signal. I unstalled and reinstalled it, but that only made things worse. I've had to delete and redownload this app 13 times and restart my phone after each attempt. I still cannot access my account and it seems like I'm not the only that has had this issue.

      <p>Indeed, it's a phishing business! It takes a lot to find a tasker on the app, and if you find one, they demand a huge amount of money and long hours of work for a small task. And then if you cancel them, they will charge you for the cancellation. So this is a win-win play for the TaskRabbit robbers and a big loss for the customer. Also, forget about customer service; they don't help you at all.</p>

      <p>Not a great 1st experience. Took a few days to match a tasker. I then agreed to delay for another week to tie in with the their schedule. They then cancelled at 2am the day before they were due to come without any explanation. Wish I hadn't bothered, total waste of time. Might be an idea to add cancellation rate in taskers profile so bookers are aware before booking. Won't be using again sorry! 🤷‍♀️</p>

What I got was three hours of a guy sawing 2x4’s IN MY LIVINGROOM, sending sawdust throughout the house, then screwing and unscrewing the same few pieces of random-length wood into my window for 3 hours. He did not complete the task, and I finally had to send him home. Did I mention he was two hours late? This is a guy who had 50 “reviews” and a 4.9 star rating.

      <p>Before this new update you used to be able
to choose from a set of available taskers in your area. You could see how many tasks the person had completed and what their reviews were. With this new update you cannot choose who will be your tasker. Instead you are randomly assigned a tasker with no ability to see what the options of other taskers are. Also paying all the taskers the same flat rate as opposed to allowing taskers to set their own rates is a disgusting way to treat workers. Somebody who has been a tasker for years with solid reviews should not be paid the same as a person who just started. Professionals should be able to adjust their rates to reflect their level of expertise. As a customer who values good work I would truly rather pay more for somebody with good reviews and experience than pay somebody that I got randomly assigned with no choice in the matter.</p>

He didn’t even bother reading the task description or message I clearly detailed I wanted tinted window film added to my single split window. The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

      <h4>BEWARE! Deceptive Billing Practices Ruined My TaskRabbit Experience, 1 stars (Angel UT Longhorn, Apple App Store, 2024-03-17)</h4>
      <p>I recently used TaskRabbit to hire a tasker for some yard work, and what I thought would be a convenient and straightforward experience turned into a nightmare of hidden fees and deception. As a customer, I value transparency and honesty, but TaskRabbit failed miserably in this regard. Firstly, the advertised hourly rate of the tasker conveniently omitted significant additional fees, including a whopping "Trust & Support Fee" that was nowhere to be found during the browsing process. This fee, which amounted to a staggering 37% of the tasker's hourly rate, was only revealed after I received my inflated invoice. This blatant lack of transparency is nothing short of deceitful. Furthermore, the sales tax was also sneakily added to my bill, further inflating the cost of the service without any prior disclosure. Such hidden charges significantly tarnished my trust in TaskRabbit and left me feeling betrayed as a customer. TaskRabbit needs to understand that honesty and transparency are paramount in building and maintaining customer trust. Concealing fees and misleading customers is not only unethical but also undermines the integrity of the entire platform. I urge TaskRabbit to rectify these deceptive billing practices immediately and provide full transparency regarding all fees upfront. Customers deserve to know the true cost of the services they're purchasing without any unpleasant surprises. Until then, I cannot in good conscience recommend TaskRabbit to anyone, and I will certainly be seeking alternative options for my future tasks. TaskRabbit, you've lost a once-loyal customer due to your dishonesty. It's time to clean up your act and prioritize integrity over profit.</p>

      <p>I highly recommend Mykola for any handyman services you may need. He arrived promptly, demonstrating excellent professionalism from the start. Equipped with a wide array of tools and fully prepared for the task at hand, he wasted no time getting to work. To my surprise, Mykola completed the job in a fraction of the time that another handyman had estimated it would take. His prompt and effective service not only saved me precious time and money, but also alleviated any unnecessary stress. Given the exceptional quality of his work, I believe he deserves more than just a standard tip. Had I opted for a different handyman, I would have likely incurred double the expenses and wasted valuable time.

Without hesitation, I wholeheartedly recommend Mykola's services to anyone in need.With Mykola, you can trust that your project will be in good hands every time. He is a true professional with relieble and an unmatched skill set, and I am immensely grateful for his invaluable assistance.</p>

      <p>Was looking for lawn maintenance & found someone who looked good & had a reasonable rate. When I booked, I saw a “trust & support fee” that was unclear if it was hourly or one-time, it was about $20 compared to the tasker’s hourly rate of about $40. When I tried to look on the TR website about the fee, it also did not specify whether the fee was hourly or one-time. A quick google search confirmed that this is an HOURLY fee on top of the tasker’s hourly rate making my potential lawn guy about $77/hour. Unfortunately I ended up canceling the job and deleting the app. This additional fee just makes all of their taskers too expensive.</p>

      <p>I don’t know what I was thinking using this app I read some of the reviews and I said OK let me give it a try. First Tasker was elite Tasker, so I had high expectations high standards.. the reviews were stellar, this tasker canceled on me, if anyone knows me, I plan I am detail oriented and when a game plan in place for anything I schedule. The task failed to communicate to me that her current job she was working on got pushed back so that means she wouldn’t have gotten to me until about 930pm 
So I had to keep it moving, but I said hey second chances, let me give him a try, the customer service gave me a $35 credit so I said why not, second tasker was second and highest rating with good reviews. People if I show you the pictures of the mess that was left in my house little girl was not even worth the money she’s charging.

I’ve put in two calls today to Taskrabbit responded to their email with the photos to make very clear I will not be paying anyone any money. 

The only good thing out of this process was the customer service reps, attempting and trying to help other than that I will not be using this app again</p>

      <h4>A nice layout, and a very helpful service, 5 stars (Gi Gi 28, Apple App Store, 2024-02-18)</h4>
      <p>The layout of the office is easy to understand and maneuver. I have been so hesitant about getting tasks done, and was very nervous about trusting a stranger in my home. Being a single woman in her 60’s, it frightened me to have a stranger come by, but my friends reassured me that Task Rabbit completely and thoroughly checked out  backgrounds and histories of their 
recommendations. I used the reviews and ratings to pick the person I picked, and he was excellent!  He got a lot done in a short amount of time!</p>

      <h4>Decent, 4 stars (Ginobro, Apple App Store, 2024-09-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve personally had a good experience on this app, but I think that’s mostly because I was able to pick my own person. It’s not easy finding reliable and competent people to help especially on short notice and especially in the Bay Area. Gino in Palo Alto was great every time I’ve hired him for my business, but I recently tried to book an additional person to help mount a heavy art piece and unfortunately wasn’t able to take the time to select a person, it simply auto-assigned someone. It worked out ok, but I’d rather have been able to pick my own help.</p>
