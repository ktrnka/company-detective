        <h1>About Taskrabbit</h1>
<p>Taskrabbit is a marketplace platform that connects individuals needing assistance with local "Taskers" who can provide various services. Founded in 2008, Taskrabbit was acquired by the Ingka Group (IKEA) in 2017, which has significantly influenced its growth and service offerings. The company operates in thousands of cities across nine countries, including Canada, France, Monaco, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and is available in over 200 IKEA stores worldwide <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/taskrabbit">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit offers a wide range of services, such as handyman services, moving assistance, furniture assembly (notably for IKEA products), cleaning services, lawn care, and virtual assistance tasks like data entry and personal assistant services. The platform facilitates these services through its website and mobile app, allowing users to book services with options for same-day availability <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/blog/tasker-stories-an-unlikely-friendship">(TaskRabbit, 2022)</a>.</p>
<p>The company primarily operates on a B2C model, serving individuals and families who require help with everyday tasks. Taskrabbit's mission is to create a better everyday life for people by facilitating connections between neighbors and providing opportunities for individuals to earn a meaningful income on their own terms <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/taskrabbit/5a1d8819240000240061e8f8">(LeadIQ, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>Taskrabbit has experienced growth in its user base and Tasker population, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the acceptance of gig economy services. The integration with IKEA has reportedly increased the share of shoppers purchasing assembly services by 50% and reduced returns by 40% <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/ikea-streamlines-taskrabbit-furniture-assembly-service-checkout/740315/">(Walk-Morris &amp; Howland, Retail Dive, 2025)</a>.</p>

      <p>I hate this app/service more than I have space to type here. Been trying to become a Tasker for well over a year now and there are never any opportunities, so your registration gets paused. Eventually you have to re-register because your account gets removed and you get zero notification. Good luck calling customer service, you'll be on hold forever and get bounced around like a basketball. I hope this company fails miserably. App functionality is garbage, too.</p>

      <p>The app itself could use better engineers. I haven't been able to log into the app for several weeks. It's just a gray screen. I have a regular cleaner from the app we've been using for months and she's great and reliable. But the app needs some serious TLC. You also can't put in your own credits for recurring services so they basically discourage using the same person, so probably not great for cleaners. I have to reach out to customer service each time I want them to apply a credit.</p>

      <p>Giving it two stars because the functionality works, but the way the service is set up is awful. You have to pay for a job in order to ask any questions. In my case I waited so long for responses back from the tasker that the 24 hr period for free cancelation was over. So I had to ask the Tasker to cancel on his end in order for me not to be charged the full amount (it was a 1 hr job). So awkward, and unfair to both of us. Why do they do it this way? I won't be using this service again no thanks</p>

      <p>I don't understand why IKEA continues to refer Task Rabbit to clients. Task Rabbit staff will grab a booking just so they can secure a job that the client has paid for in advance at IKEA. Then the Task Rabbit Tasker will try to rebook the appointment, sometimes numerous times. Additionally, Task Rabbit doesn't recognize 'old' passwords so a client will have to register a new P/W. If the client does not do so, the client can not communicate w/ the Tasker.</p>

      <p>Taskers are hit or miss. You really have to put work in to find a good fit for tasks, but I’ve found some that are good (more than are not). The “trust and support fee” is sometimes disproportionately high given the task, which is especially frustrating when the tasker does a poor job and you have to start the search over.  

The app is incredibly glitchy, even after updates. The site is also glitchy (or maybe poorly designed). Specifically:
-times that tasks are scheduled for often don’t display properly 
-tasks don’t move from upcoming to completed when they should
-tipping is difficult or impossible to access because the window just disappears (with repeated attempts)
-messages with tasker get lost
-task time changes don’t get saved</p>

      <p>I’ve consistently had terrible experiences getting a hold of anyone in support when my unreliable taskers either cancel or don’t show up on. It’s fascinating that someone can cancel on you literally minutes before your appointment w/ no comment/message and your chat history just either disappears so you can’t even keep a log of the terrible person for future reference, you definitely have no way to rate them for their unreliability (so … what’s the point of hiring someone based on reviews when they are skewed) NOR is it possible for you to write them directly to share your disappointment. 
This is now my second experience within the same 2 week window (one a few months ago) where both people confirmed, then waited until the last minute to cancel w/out even a courtesy message. 
One literally wasted a week chatting asking for photos, details only for him to say - “great, see you in an hour”  then poof - magically disappears. 

Customer service does not exist. 

I’m desperately looking for another service provider because this app ain’t it!</p>

      <p>I've been working as a Tasker and we use TaskRabbit to find workers.

This is mainly for people to read that book as clients.

1) READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GIG. If You book us for jobs that aren’t a match. You waste our time and yours. But TR dings US for forfeiting the job and flags your account.

2) DO NOT HIRE WITHOUT DETAILS.
There’s different depths of certain gigs. Like cleaning, “clean my house” doesn’t cut it. How bad is it? Size?

3)DO NOT DISAPPEAR this is known as “client is unresponsive in chat” the gig gets canceled. 

4) BE AVAILABLE TO REPLY

5) DO NOT GET MIFFED BECAUSE THINGS HAVE TO BE IN WRITING.
This is for our and your protection. Verbally asking for a deep clean during a regular clean then disputing the extra charge after it’s finished happens a lot. There are shady clients believe it or not. 

6) BE HOME or leave us access. Running more than 15 minutes late is unacceptable. We have other jobs to get to and need to be on time because so we don’t get bad reviews.

I recently got restricted for declining jobs. The jobs were declined because they were biohazards and because the client didn’t respond. Task Rabbit’s team lacks the logic of making decisions based on reviews. Their solution is to penalize an elite Tasker and affect their livelihood while also keeping them from generating revenue for the company collected in fees.

I have already submitted a complaint and appeal.</p>

      <p>Good app to find a person to do special jobs but taskers can accept a job and then cancel last minute without consequence.  This has happened to me multiple times.  This includes arranging one's day or staying home from work only for the tasker to cancel last minute and you have to schedule a new person for a new time on another day.  There is no guarantee the next person shows up either.

Imagine preparing for an event at your house or having a day off to get something done.  Then the work doesn't get done because of a no show.  Multiple times.

There should be a penalty cost for late cancellations given to the requestor for blown appointments.</p>

      <p>TaskRabbit, the epitome of unprofessionalism and unreliability. If you're looking for a service that will consistently disappoint and leave you high and dry, look no further.
My experience with TaskRabbit has been an exercise in frustration and wasted time. Three times, I've scheduled cleaning services through their platform, and three times, I've been left scrambling at the last minute because the maid decided she had better things to do.
It's bad enough to have your plans thrown into disarray by a cancellation, but what's truly maddening is the complete lack of consequences for these flaky maids. They can bail on appointments with impunity, leaving customers like me in the lurch, and TaskRabbit doesn't bat an eyelash.
And don't even get me started on TaskRabbit's customer service – or lack thereof. When I reached out for assistance after yet another cancellation, I was met with nothing but indifference and excuses. It's clear they have no interest in actually helping their customers or holding their so-called "taskers" accountable.
TaskRabbit's motto should be "We'll be there for you... until we're not." Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this sham of a service. There are plenty of other platforms out there that actually value their customers' time and deserve their hard-earned money. TaskRabbit isn't one of them.</p>

We scheduled cleaners to work on our bathrooms. The task who arrived looked nothing like the Tasker in the photo. 

The Tasker clearly lacked experience and the right kind of tools and products despite her profile saying she’ll bring everything. 

I work was sub par - obvious spots a stains were missed, no effort to clean under the sinks or toilet seat, or around the drain. She clearly lacked the experience and the intent to clean. This further confirms our belief that the task was outsourced. 

We paid over $200 for 2.5 hours only to see minimal results. 

We hired different cleaners to redo the job two days after she completed it.</p>

      <h4>Worst customer service and no accountability of task assignments, 1 stars (CigAppReview, Apple App Store, 2025-01-23)</h4>
      <p>This app may look good on the surface, but the service TaskRabbit provides as a middleman is absolutely abysmal—far below third-class. They completely wash their hands of any responsibility after matching you with a Tasker. Here’s what happened in my case:
1.I had two Taskers assigned to a job, and neither finished the work on the same day. They promised to return the next day, but only one showed up. While the second Tasker managed to finish the job, TaskRabbit refused to pay him fairly for completing it.
2.After rescheduling the task for another day, the new Tasker assigned wasn’t even available at the time I specifically requested. When the Tasker declined the task, TaskRabbit’s only response was to tell me to reschedule again instead of assigning someone reliable.

This app is completely unreliable, especially if you’re booking services like IKEA assembly or anything else. TaskRabbit does nothing to support you when there’s an issue with their Taskers. The lack of accountability is shocking. I’m beyond dissatisfied and will never use this app again. Save yourself the headache and avoid it entirely.</p>

      <p>My tasker did a ~10 minute job and I was charged for 2hrs worth of work because of his 2hr minimum. To be charged nearly $300 for a 10 minute task is so distasteful and the fact that Task Rabbit permits this is exploitative to customers to say the least. I’d have understood if I was charged for 1hrs worth of service (even that though that itself is far above the reality), but 2hrs? For a 10 minute job? The other tasker I booked cancelled on me last minute. The 2hr minimum was not written anywhere in the tasker’s profile and was sprung on me when the task had already been accepted and I needed the job done. I could not use this to make a decision when booking the task. Such a poor experience from a customer’s perspective and I feel taken advantage of. I proceeded to delete the app as I do not plan to use this service moving forward. 
(Customer service was useless in supporting me with this issue. They have no vested interest in customer retention. Dont waste your time)
Don’t even get me started on a ~30% added support fee PER HOUR! Go to a professional company or local handyman, don’t use this app—at least your money would be worth it.</p>

      <p>They charge a protection/service fee every hour alongside the tasked fee increasing the bill tremendously as they set it at a % they determine I believe is between 15-10% my last service with task rabbit will be my last as I’m uninstalling the app. The fee was like an additional $10+ on top of the service man’s fee of $40+ the man wasn’t experienced in the work he was doing. He didn’t even bother reading the task description or message I clearly detailed I wanted tinted window film added to my single split window. The film was applied with many bubbles and my boyfriend helped him apply it and the service man didn’t even bother cleaning the window before applying the film ! Not as bad as the service man who took 3 days to put up blinds and milked us for over 8 hours of work daily! I’ll find a more reliable app that has replicable services available at better or fairer prices. Also Taskrabbit never returned my email for help asking for the service fee and why it was applied every hour instead of a flat fee them getting a cut of over $50 for a service fee, for every service is bull if you ask me. I thank god nothing went terrible on the tasks because the horror stories of taskers ruining peoples home and Taskrabbit saying they cannot help is bull also so what’s with that dumb fee?!???

So I decided to give them a try again. Now a new problem: There is no way to message the tasker before booking them. Really? THe last tasker claimed to be able to work on routers. He was not. But a few questions could have screened him successfully. So I am guessing some taskers were trying to circumvent the system- and there is no way to screen them successfully from providing their contact info. This is basically unachievable. But that breaks the ability to screen the wrong taskers and I just can't take the chance.</p>

      <h4>Expand to Delaware, 5 stars (Netflix needs to change, Apple App Store, 2024-12-05)</h4>
      <p>Hello, just wanted to write a review on here as I am a military member located in Dover, Delaware and I think it would be an amazing addition to add the area to your coverage area. I would help promote the app by sharing it to the military base Facebook page as people always need help with all kinds of things on and around base. Also, as a person who just enjoys doing task of all kinds and just by looking over the app itself I would highly recommend it to anyone that needs to make a little extra money or even would like to help others that may not have the knowledge or skills that other folks have gain knowledge in over there years of living. I’m looking forward to your reply. Thanks in advance for creating an app to help others who strive to work hard and for the people that need some help.

      <h4>Fast, simple, positive experiences, 5 stars (Atlas10k, Apple App Store, 2024-01-29)</h4>
      <p>I have used TaskRabbit for multiple types of tasks. Each Tasker has been qualified, and excellent to work with. The app is easy to use, fast to find/schedule/reschedule, and provides reliable communication with Taskers. I’m a fan!</p>
