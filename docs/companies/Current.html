<h3>User Experience Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I spent about 10 minutes this morning dialing in my kitchen and living room for some ambient morning lighting that I’d love to have come on when I wake…. Only to realize that there is no 'save as' feature and I have to now go and take screen shots to remember settings and then dial them in one by one." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/twtrqy/save_current_settings_as_scene/">(Chi_Sao_, Reddit, 2022-04-05)</a></li>
