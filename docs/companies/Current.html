<h2>Employee Relations</h2>
<p>Current Lighting has faced challenges in employee relations, particularly at its Christiansburg plant, where workers have rallied over contract negotiations. Union representatives have expressed dissatisfaction due to the lack of raises over the past two years and the expiration of their contract. A mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service is expected to assist in the negotiations <a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/business/employees-rally-over-contract-at-christiansburgs-current-lighting/article_0ecf1a6c-e570-11ee-88d0-2386d00b8887.html">(Employees rally over contract at Christiansburg's Current Lighting, 2024)</a>.

<h2>Industry Context</h2>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
