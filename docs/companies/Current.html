        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>COMPANY Current</h2>
<h3>General Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Let me be clear, I'm not dissatisfied with the Current, it works as advertised... but if I had to do it again, I'd wait two months for the all in one product that put out higher wattage." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/3gubgd/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_the_current/cu1jkc2/">(HadManySons, Reddit, 2015-08-13)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>PRODUCT Current</h2>
<h3>Price and Value</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I bought it over the Finnex Planted Plus 24/7 because it was cheaper and would ship a lot faster... I was pretty disappointed by that, and that I had settled for a lower wattage light and now I wish I had bought the Finnex." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/3gubgd/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_the_current/cu1ixnx/">(HadManySons, Reddit, 2015-08-13)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I had 3 of the 48" 4008 units on my 80g and 2 on my 55 gal. Low and med light plants grew fine with them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/3gubgd/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_the_current/cu1s38e/">(Blottoboxer, Reddit, 2015-08-13)</a></li>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Be careful with the 24/7. It only has ONE preset, uncustomizable setting that ramps your lights up and down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/3gubgd/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_the_current/cu1jzz1/">(Fiishman, Reddit, 2015-08-13)</a></li>
