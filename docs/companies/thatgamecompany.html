<li>"3 days of server crashes? come on. other MMO companies would probably be getting lambasted for the same things TGC gets away with doing during a high-traffic season." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb8b0z/">(cloudberi, Reddit, 2024-08-28)</a></li>

<li>"If we don't, I'm legit NEVER paying for anything again. Going completely free to play, full stop, forever." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb34kf/">(Particular-Crow-1799, Reddit, 2024-08-28)</a></li>

<li>"The technical issues aside, another thing that's been bugging me is the small group of individuals who feel like it is their duty to defend TGC and their lack of action on the official discord and other media platforms every time a game breaking bug occurs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb4ibc/">(Busy-Prompt7843, Reddit, 2024-08-28)</a></li>
<li>"I genuinely feel bad for other players because sure, 200 candles is a lot, especially when you've been promised a group TS coming real soon, and add to that these server errors forcing people to buy candle packs instead of candle running?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkc4qac/">(Mailynn393, Reddit, 2024-08-28)</a></li>

      <p>movement controls? awful. game play? boring. storyline? confusing. replayability? none. all this game is, is a rinse and repeat cycle of; get wing levels from the same spots, go to literal hell and suffer through how difficult the movement controls make the game, lose all your progress for around a miniscule 7 in game currency candles so you can pitifully attempt to get extremely overpriced cosmetics which require you to log in and grind daily. the whole game feels like a chore.</p>

      <p>this is a brilliant game... I download it today and I am in love with the Graphics the only thing that it is very difficult to fly for newbies, but you will get the hang of it. anyways the looks of this game is top notch! you have to download this game, NOW!! i am sure you wont regret downloading this game but i am not really vibing with this new update, but its still fun to play! Well the "free" items are actually hours or grinding which i don't enjoy at all its so pretty but also so pricey!</p>

      <p>lovely, great story, nice controls, worth logging in once in a while for flying n cute stuff. Great community tho it gets chaotic sometimes. Not a pay to enjoy game, but very easy to fall in the fomo(the iaps are crazy expensive, and only season pass are arguably worth getting; tgc also getting more aggressive w the predatory with their prices, bad sign imo). Gets pretty boring easily after a while bc maps stay same. android is laggy and srsly needs huge overhaul to optimize in older devices</p>

      <p>Okay TGC, i think this is really fun game! but the price always stressed me out like, 108 for 1 cape? that's so expensive 😭. And somehow i got stuck in a wall in the cafe at Aviary Village. i cannot get out --. And players glitching there and there were lots of hackers here 😅. storylines sometimes glitches like they stop in the middle of a storyline (that's sometimes glitches at Season of Moments storylines) although, good game here, you've tried your best to make a fun adventurous game tgc</p>

      <p>It's good and fun but I don't know why I can't see the spirits. I can see some but only a few of them, the same goes for traveling spirits. At first, I thought there was something wrong with my account so I made a new one but it didn't change anything. I always have to bring a friend whenever I'm looking for a spirits because they can see them and I can't. I don't want to redo it all on a new account, so I still play in my main. Please do something to fix it 😭🙏</p>

      <p>Edit: Change the camera angle for dyeing clothes like everyone's been asking for months. You CANNOT see the clothes you're dyeing because it's WAY too zoomed in!! The grind takes wayyyyyyyy too long to buy way too little.. Cosmetics are way too expensive, it quickly gets off-putting and discouraging.</p>

      <p>Recently there's a massive banning of accounts and most of this people got banned just because of tricks(not a hack) and unconsciously being friend with hackers. Many already reached out to the contacts of this game yet they only provide a repeated answer. To those follow up or message again didn't got any response. If they did, it was about their service. The game itself is a self explanatory system, where you build memories. Yet the company itself is not well enought to handle thiskindofmatter</p>

      <p>They say their items are exclusive so you'll buy their adventure passes, or their IAPs, but TGC hasn't kept their word on this, so many times. They get hungry for money, and lie about their promises. They have concepts that are communistic in nature, making it a disappointing experience as a veteran, after they've accepted your money. I don't respect liars, and hate being lied to. All my friends quit long ago for these reasons. Now, I'm done also.</p>

      <p>still learning the game. This game is beyond adventure. the moral, so symbolic and emotional. It's nice to meet other players and help you out. I can't forget the first time I reached the Eden.... met 3 players, and we did it together. It was emotional. We died one by one eventually... Reached the next stage. Sleep. Then, when I'm about to continue the game, I went back to the realm, like I was back to start. wondered why... coz I never see the part I was reborn. curius.</p>

      <p>Too many bugs now. Also why the server always split when i'm still talking to someone, even when i'm doing candle run with my friends? Always got separated with my friends in the middle of candle run because of this. edit: also sometimes the game force closed and when i back, i always alone with no other player. It doesn't affect much but in some place like prairie and vault that need 2 person to open the gates. Overall the game design is good but the server is buggy and got many problems</p>

I spent money and time playing this game.. happy for the progress BEFORE my account got banned permanently due to misunderstanding.. and the worst is the support team never trying to listen or responding back to you. What's the use of giving players warning if you will end up getting banned permanently at the end. (using 3rd party once and after warning I stop, but they keep banning your account just like that) I lost contact with a lot of my overseas friends.. GOOD JOB TGC</p>

      <p>Breathtaking. Phenomenal job in creating a masterpiece, this transcends the game into art! Pros: 1) Amazing atmosphere and ambience 2) Smooth controls 3) Genius sound design and art. Cons: 1) Battery drains very fast( Understandable given its nature, but also features settings to lower FPS and resolution.)</p>

      <h4>The current state of the game…, 1 stars (minnchip, Apple App Store, 2024-12-03)</h4>
      <p>Sky is a cute, fun and calming game, I have had many wonderful experiences playing it with my friends over the years. However, I just can’t recommend the game in its current state. I am writing this review to call attention to problems that need addressing. Buckle in this is a long one

First- Sky is absolutely falling apart with glitches. Every update this past year has caused the game to break down in some type of way; mass server disconnections, the appearance of your progress being erased, quests breaking, unusable features, and even one that’s happening right now- a glitch that causes the daily candle timer to repeatedly reset, breaking player character animations and softlocking your in-game currency collection.
Another very bad glitch was one that caused the screen to strobe flash in an area, which posed danger for those with epilepsy. This did not get fixed for over a month. It’s common for glitches in Sky to go without being fixed for lengthy periods of time, despite the community’s constant reports. I cannot understand how these issues continue to happen, and can only hope more systems are implemented to fix their code and prevent against such glitches.

Also, it’s a fact that hundreds of live-service games regularly gift their communities premium currency as an apology for glitches, or to show respect for sticking with them through the process of planned maintenance. I can only remember Sky doing this once, and it was after a huge outcry by the community some months ago after the game was in an unplayable state for a week. Something so common in other games is strangely not a regular habit here. It becomes more upsetting when you consider how Sky events & items are limited-time, that a large number of players are paying customers, and players must make effort every day farming candles to get the fun items they want before it’s gone. If something out of the player’s control prevents them from playing the game, there is often no compensation for what was lost. And if there is, it’s inadequate. A measly 15 candles + extending farming events (which serves to make players log in and work to earn themselves more of what they lost out on, through no fault of their own) after a week of the game being unplayable isn’t very fair. The community often accuses the company of being stingy and asks why they can’t show more goodwill. One of many reasons why players feel disconnected with the company.

Continuing on that, yes a core gameplay of Sky is to collect candles, in-game currency used to purchase equipment and outfits. But more things seem to be getting changed which inconvenience the player with this. Player-created solutions to the repetitive farming get suddenly changed like locations for AFK idle light, or the controversial recent Grandma’s Table shared space removal. Harmless well-known strategies that help all players are patched out for unexplained reasons which makes people upset, and there is no “proper” alternative to those that’s offered. Events happen simultaneously which makes it difficult to save up candles and causes burnout from farming. Yet candles, cosmetics and more items are continually offered as expensive in-app purchases to buy with your real money.

It feels like the company doesn’t know what players want. The playerbase is stretched for their time, money, and feels like they are made to constantly experience FOMO. Of course, that is if they can play at all with the glitches.

Many of my friends stopped playing in the last year, and I am likely soon to follow. Sky is such a beautiful, unique and relaxing game for me, but its state now is unfortunate. 
Developers- if you read this, I sincerely hope this serves as constructive criticism for you. I would truly love if the game and your treatment to players can improve in the future & encourage me and many others to return someday.</p>

      <p>I love this game. It was the first ever game I loved so much. The music is amazing! It makes me feel relaxed when I feel upset٫ or not in a great mood. I recommend the app becauss its adventurous٫ and you can use creativity. Theres puzzles٫ and you can make friends. I don't know why people are such weirdos over the app. I love it٫ and reccomend it for everyone. The characters  are very well detailed٫ and I love how good their made. The reason why I think everyone should have it is because theres no adds! I love how its a smooth game٫ and no stops for adds. One thing I recommend adding is names. I havent played the full game٫ so I dont know if you can add names. But i would love to name my friends! I hope for an update soon! But thats not a problem! Anyway٫ have a good day/night dev! -StarLight</p>

      <h4>Please bring back  depth to this amazing game.  Fix the basic bugs!, 3 stars (Hardcore_Since_4, Apple App Store, 2025-01-17)</h4>
      <p>Been playing 4 years. Since 2023ish many base functionality bugs keep reverting back, over n over. Terrible panning n zoom , 5/15 candles counted, lag that has nada to do with wifi (it's their servers). Rn? Handhold is silly broken again - a bug from 4 years ago replicated  at least 3 times since.  The bugs used to be funny but since they added FestWjat after aurora season and focusing more on  PC/steam, basic play has become so bugged that everyone is annoyed. The oldest players just gone now cuz it's frustrating to watch basics decline while they pump out more and more glittery prop.  
One major issue (if a long term player), is the friendship constellation where we can join friends who are online. It has been broken for OVER 2 YEARS - often, your besties will appear offline you if you log in before them and vise verse. The game isn't updating logins anymore. So if you log in after your other bestie has a;ready logged in, they won't see as being online in the home constellation. And you either get sad or force restart about 10 times til they finally show up.  So often I'll log in same time with my bff (pre- arranged off-game to meet up) and neither of us can see us being online even though we are in the same server. No biggie til you split 10 mins later and can't tp back. So.  Restart restart restart til one of us can find the other. But this is an on-going issue with so many of my friends who have played at leas years. Ppl without full constellation don't seem to have this prob as bad. 
Also, be careful with chat - autocorrect vs AI censoring has gone crazy, very easy to be muted for 60 minutes foraying something basic like Hel lo or halo or HELLO. 
All complaining aside,  Sky is an incredible game w/ an amazing community of ppl - it's really the friends we've made that keeps us oldies coming back so when chat or netting is so broken, it's a big deal . But tgc doesn't care about veterans lately, so idk.  Also? The Vanilla-icing aspect lately for kiddos is making this once very deep, sometimes dark game, feel cheesy n vanilla. Kids were rare when most of us started playing - in fact it was super uncommon for people to even ask ages or genders. New players all wanna unlock chat in a minute but not everyone wants chat unlock via qr. but feel guilty not accepting. 

Thanks for the wonderful moments. I play because of my friends. But they're leaving because they'd appreciate less fluff and more depth again, lore!!! And some major challenge again like prophecy gave and krills. But it's also cuz of the heat overload sky has on mobiles np less than 2 years old - heatsink n  cpu/ on mobiles is burning batteries harder than 3 Genshins at once since pc/steam landed. Fix it!</p>

      <p>Started playing Sky during Season of Enchantment 2020 and since then I didn’t have an issue until the season of Moonie. Have always done ingame purchases. I purchased the season of Moonie, the game stated I had 12 hours before the season ended, came back before 12 hrs and the season had already ended. I contacted support for help but they declined my request to get the last item because I was short 2 candles. However their system is always glitchy and as you work hard to get the candles daily sometimes you don’t get them all. I have never complained about it since it wasn’t a big deal until now. But they refused to give me the last item because of two candles after I had spend money in the game for years. Fix your glitches and bugs! I am leaving the game and if later I decide to play I won’t be spending money.</p>

In order to talk to another player you need to use candles to friend them, and then pay another candle for the chatting button. You can’t communicate while your friend is offline, either. You also can’t send a message for everyone to see, only your friends can see what you have typed. This makes the game a LOT more safe for kids. Being unable to widely broadcast a message will keep tons of people off of scam websites and away from gross adults. There is also a way to block other players, which is extremely helpful for safety. The storyline of the game is somewhat unclear, and it allows for the player to come up with their own ideas. I’ve played for years, and I’ve never been bored. Love you, Sky COTL <3</p>

      <h4>Beautiful game but will scam of money, 1 stars (Jaejae(:, Apple App Store, 2024-12-01)</h4>
      <p>Jenova Chen needs to step down from CEO… 

I have started my sky journey June 13 of 2024. Since then I have spent over $1k of real money and have been trying to find a way to strike against this app and get my money back so I can delete the game completely for I no longer want to continue investing into a game filled with glitches, Server drops, AI muting players for saying simple words that do not go against terms guide lines, not being able to successfully candle run due to glitches in game that can lose you out of 200+ candles a month (ex: grandma event not working for an entire month) and WITH TODAYS & YESTERDAYS SAME GLITCH OF daily refresh/ refresh of entire soul MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN PLAY. I want a complete refund, delete my account sky. You have proven to me that my 1k in 5 months has not invested in proper coding techniques nor the fact that this game is clearly not ready to be taking real money in general. Due to always feeling like everything will be fixed and my game play experience will go smoothly- I have been investing my own money to help the cause and to also make sure I am not losing out of candles while TGC are still putting out travel spirits, events and seasons around the same time with items costing no less than 9.99 (real money) and items that cost in game candles anywhere from 50-300 while only being able to get 22 candles a day max (you can only reach this is if you have 3+ hours to spend everyday). I am aware that we do not have to buy every item, though it is not fair when the game glitches to the point of not being able to receive the full amount of candles everyday. Not only that but you have to wait a year to even see if the same spirits/events/ seasons/ travel spirits will come if you miss an item… this is how they catch you and where the addiction starts. Enough of your games TGC. Please REFUND ME EVERY OUNCE OF MY MONEY. It is not our fault you are in debt due to the beginnings of the run of your app having failed in numbers and probably having to pay AURORA back. Stop using glitches as a reason your created addicts (once fans) use in game purchases for candles and items. This is sick and disturbing. You can find and ban hackers in a day that actually help people candle run and are the Robin Hood’s of this game during your glitches, but it takes a month for you to fix your glitches to increase your chances of in game purchases?!? You guys can’t even compensate for these huge in game mistakes?! STOP THIS OR THIS GAME WILL NO LONGER EXIST TGC!!! Please, for your fans that truly love what you have created, like I did. I was enjoying funding something as beautiful as you have created. But now you give me no choice for It has become greedy and unjust.</p>

      <p>Play with friends and meet people and explore a pretty universe. But once you go through the game there’s not a reason to come back. They could’ve added more to actually do in the game like more trials, platforming, mini games.. something.

   But instead they just add some short stories to walk through with extremely expensive cosmetics to buy and a painfully long farming machine that is getting candles to unlock things. Then they make this worse by having “traveling spirits” that come back with cosmetic options that you can only get for a few days and poof their gone. So this also incentivizes players to spend hours getting candles. 

   Fun for a few days as a new player but otherwise there is no reason to stay playing this game.</p>

      <h4>Great but bug and suggestions, 5 stars (tingyao2, Apple App Store, 2025-02-11)</h4>
      <p>I totally love this game, but there are a few things :
1. Bug: try to deep call but flaps wings at the same time.
This problem didn’t even exist before, but one day, I was playing the game, and I try to deep call and I long press my character, I did long call, but I also flapped twice… pls fix this!
2. Suggestion #1: the furniture! They’re. Too. Expensive. 
I mean, WHAT? 24 hearts for A BED? And to get another one I have to use ANOTHER 24 HEARTS?! You’ve gotta be kidding! 10 hearts for a shelf is… alright I guess. But why do I have to spend another 10 hearts for another one?! And the seashell music player needs 33 ASCENDED CANDLES?! FOR A MUSIC PLAYER?!! I could never :( . What’s more, lots of other furniture need a lot of ASCENDED CANDLES!! Seriously.😐. THE. FURNITURE. IS. TOO. EXPENSIVE. Pls fix this.
3. Suggestion #2: Aviary entrance pole.
Where did it go? On a roof 😑. Plz put it back to the aviary entrance! I looks better there.
4. Suggestion #3: Furniture sales.
Can I sell the furniture I don’t want at the nesting workshop? That way I can earn candles and hearts without having to go through SOOO much trouble trying to buy A BED. If I can’t sell them, I should be able to trade them. Sky: The children of light is like living in a fantasy, magical life, so players should be able to sell and trade stuff, instead of just buying them. Helping spirits and completing quests given by them is a huge improvement, but I really think you should add this, lots of players would like that, I’m sure.
5. Suggestion #4: Add more creatures?
I was thinking, if there are dark dragons, maybe add some light dragons?
6. Suggestion #5: Companion? Maybe?
Maybe let players have animal companions? Like, not pets, but helps and follows players, or will arrive when called? That would be nice. Just a suggestion though.
7. Suggestion #6: Nests
Our nests are nice, but maybe expand them a bit, we have a small balcony, a room, a few windows and a doorway, but maybe separate our nests into three rooms? Like, a main room, where we enter, a slightly smaller room, and a slightly larger room. No need to change the balcony though. 
That’s all. I hope you read my suggestions, and help with my bug, and I hope you’ll put them in the game. Otherwise, the game is amazing. Love it.</p>

      <p>Number one: Does not let me place props anymore ALL PROPS WASTED!! whenever I try to place there should be a check button that lets you place the prop but it just does not appear anymore for me. TGC should really improve on gameplay on macbook.
Number two (new): whenever I try to chat the entire game screen glitches and sort of freezes but after I finish typing I can still play it's just REALLY weird.
Number three (new): whenever I lie down on hammocks and then get up again I can't lie down on them anymore and I have to reset the game if I want to lie on hammocks again.
Number four (newest): the village of dreams boats don't work anymore like there is a place where you have to use your candle to light a block and then the boats will appear I can't light that block it doesn't work and its just SO annoying I want to give this game 0 stars now..
Number five (new): WAY TOO MANY server issues and I can't even get candles anymore but my internet connection is perfectly fine TGC i know this game wasn't designed for macbook but at least make us a priority!!!! there are still lots of people who play on macbook so please respect that! 
And before I thought an update could fix everything....it just adds to the pile of problems about this game ;-;
Sky cotl has been my favorite game for a long time and I've started playing on Macbook in an attempt to make a better account with better controls and graphics the computer gives. And I've kind of succeeded in doing that I have a lot of cosmetics now and I really like this game but.... Sadly there are a lot of bugs after every update and it seems like TGC doesn't even bother to fix it. 😔</p>

      <h4>Lots of bugs, 3 stars (adatopgama, Apple App Store, 2025-02-24)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been playing sky on and off for a couple years, it’s got beautiful graphics, great story line, a good game if you’re looking for something to play long term, however there is lots and lots of bugs. recently this has gotten in the way of me being able to play and collect currency, and demotivating me from even opening the app at all. The currency has been glitching and either not loading in, or taking ungodly amount of time to load in. The shard event happens to be completed every single server I jump to, no matter how early I am to the event. And eventually after a while, the game gets repetitive. Also I myself agree with the countless complaints i’ve heard/read about being a long term player having to go through the same long routes just to get where you’re trying to go in whatever realm you are in. I think there should at least be checkpoints to teleport to when you are not grinding for currency in the game.</p>

      <h4>Disappointed, 1 stars (Sirensilver, Apple App Store, 2025-03-03)</h4>
      <p>I have been playing since enchantment/sanctuary/passage. I love this game, so it pains me to write this, but the devs are NOT listening. There is a CONSTANT grind, and this current treasure event is where I personally draw the line. F2P gets boots and a shovel and that is IT, apart from dyes. $15 if you want the pants or mask. Bloom cape is now iap (has NEVER been before, and has ALWAYS been the main item.) the majority of the community is begging for quality over quantity and you are NOT listening to us, so I will be writing this here. The iaps are ridiculously priced (there is no justification for $20 for ONE cosmetic item, which seems to be a recurring issue.) I love this game but I am so sad to see what it has become, please devs work on this. And for the love of everything SLOW DOWN. This game was comforting to so many but we are falling out of it because EVERYTHING is becoming an endless chore. Please fix this.</p>

      <h4>Currency, 5 stars (Div799, Apple App Store, 2024-12-06)</h4>
      <p>I think the game itself is great but there is a little problem. The hearts currency is barely attainable unless you have friends or you level up spirits. Even though that being said, the hearts just isn't enough. If you go solo, it like the game is telling you to buy hearts off pf the shop.0 so would you please make another way to attain hearts?</p>

      <h4>do yourself a favor — get sky., 5 stars (Crow__Kid, Apple App Store, 2024-10-26)</h4>
      <p>alright , this isn’t a recipe blog — i’ll do the reasons first and the personal story last. 1) sky is a social game, and while in some cases a brief interaction may be necessary, around 60% of the time it isn’t — and you can make people get a notification that you don’t want to be around people right now before they teleport to you or try to interact. 2) sky isn’t difficult. i’m a casual gamer who hasn’t played a true fighting game since around 2021, so you can imagine i’m not good at fighting games — and the only real enemies in this game are so easy to get past that i antagonize them for fun. and if you get hit? unless you somehow glitched there with only one winged light, it’s fairly easy to get your wl back. 3) i’ve had one semi-rude encounter in my roughly two years of playing sky. most people are infinitely kind, because the game actively nurtures that. friendly fire is near impossible, because someone has to not only actively place you in the line of a dark dragon, you also have to be new enough to not reach cover — which , by the way, is everywhere. like. seriously. it’s near impossible to get friendly fired, and most people are nice enough to not try unless they’re a Really close friend and they know you’re kind enough to find it funny. 4) the diversity on this app is insane. i learned a second language because of this game. i know people from poland, japan, china, south korea, the philippines — all because of this game. you’ll learn things you never knew. 5) it’s not pay to win. (also, other people can gift you the few items that cost real money.) no item that costs you real money will actually make progression easier, it’s all aesthetic items like clothes, instruments, or decorations. alright, i think that should tie up the logical stuff. now, let’s go on to my personal story with sky. // tw ; suicide, an abusive parent, mention of alcoholism. hi, i’m shrike. in 2021-22, i was depressed and living half with my alcoholic, emotionally abusive mother. i was depressed, exhausted, and barely coping. enter sky. a week into playing, i met hanna and yuri — from poland and italy respectively. i knew them as sixlets and beetle, because i had just nicknamed them after the first things to enter my head. we got along easily. i was a new player, and they were experienced and happy to guide me along. they only half knew what was going on — i wasn’t the kind of person to bother with telling them — but they were so kind and so considerate. when would make little comments about “ha yeah, my mom and sister are fighting rn, sorry if i type slow,” it was immediately virtual hugs and kindness. another friend who’s incredibly dear to me, cal, who is from the philippines. cal talked me down from suicide — i was about to overdose on my own medication, because of my situation. after that, if they were online i was online, and we never really seperated. my mom got drunk at a party and my sister had to drive us home, before she had her license, at one am. cal was my comfort, and they were so kind to me no matter what. and then the day after my mom got drunk, i got out. i was close to killing myself — but i got out of there and have been living with my dad since. i remember telling cal that i had gotten out , and i healed with them at my side. i’m still in therapy. i’m still recovering, and still unpacking what happened to me — but we were friends through it all. download sky. it got me through so much. even if you’re not doing as bad as i was, you’ll find yourself a happier person.</p>

      <p>This game is easily my number one top game at the moment. It’s adventurous, entertaining, relaxing and beautiful.

Because of that I don’t spend a whole lot of real cash on the game. Also there is a glitch when in one specific spot for me. I’ve tried to contact game support via email, Reddit and discord but never got a resolution.</p>

also for a “social” game you can’t just talk to anyone you have to unlock chat using candles, which will get pricey the more people you want to chat with.</p>
