<li>"I have been playing since 2021. I was hyperfixated on this game and obsessed to say the least... I have witnessed just horrendous decision making by this company to prove they care less about their player base" <a href="https://apple/12015445987">(RaeUnit, Apple App Store, 2024-12-01)</a></li>
<li>"Seeing how they overwork their artists and developers, this ain't surprising." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzw58j6/">(slumberingratshoes, Reddit, 2024-12-01)</a>]</li>
<li>"It is the profit driven mind of Jenova that has become the bane of quality for Sky." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzxz22c/">(Independent-Rip-6391, Reddit, 2024-12-01)</a>]</li>

<li>"I'm going to wait for moomin season to end... and then I'll go on a long sky break. I just can't support their company in good conscience anymore." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzvm83z/">(AnicaEddy, Reddit, 2024-12-01)</a>]</li>

      <p>Update, it's been 3 years. I still absolutely adore this game. I love the controls, the graphics, the storyline, the community, the music, and even the grind. Controls are intuitive. Graphics are stunning, sometimes so stunning my phone overheats. Storyline for main game and Seasons are beautiful and world-building. The community is the most welcoming ever. My only issue: PLEASE LOWER THE COST OF HEART ITEMS THERE'S NO WAY. 90 for 1 cape? And we can't buy them? Honestly, worst part. Still 5*!</p>

      <p>I hope if i could give this game a dislike instead of one star , the devs r doing stupid things in this game , they accused my friend that she earned her candles by hacking and made her candles to 0 😡😡 , stupid thing, stupid thing , stupid thing , and the main thing is they don't have any proof if she is hacking or no. (And don't play this game cuz u don't know that when will ur candles get removed by the devs)</p>

      <p>A great game but it's quite confusing at first and takes time to get used to it. One of the reason I hate about the game is the ridiculous price of the IAP. Just a piece of hat or hair or two items for mostly at 500+php??? I think it's very ridiculous and it upsets me because I wish to collect all the cosmetics but gave up because of it. And you have to play every day to grind for candles and it takes so much time like let's be for real. We people have a life and don't have all day to grind.</p>

      <p>At first, the game felt magical and fun, but now it’s just the same tasks over and over. Collecting light, upgrading your cape, and doing daily quests that never change. What used to feel exciting now feels like a grind, and the repetition makes it hard to enjoy. The game is beautiful, but it needs more variety to stay interesting.</p>

      <p>Make the cape visible or at least outline. It looks too empty when everyone is identical. I find users tend to take pause to admire one another when we can see each other. Won't happen when everyone looks the same. And you don't know why you want to light up someone without any unique sign. Thought individuality matters 🤷 maybe allow toggle button or something for those who want to appear visible and whatnot.</p>

      <p>The words candle and run have now traumatised me. Thanks. AHH, Candlerun. Even months after uninstalling the very through of grinding wax to afford meager accessories puts me off. The game gained traction during the pandemic and honestly I don't know how it kept going with ridiculous prices and insane grinding requirement for F2p players. Bah. Edit - it would be nice if appstore allowed paragraph breaks in reviews. My disappointment over this game doesnt measure against tight space.</p>

      <p>At first i was a little bit confused if they were npcs or not. But when I got up to a couple more levels i realized that they are real. Bye the way I like the graphics it is very realistic and relaxing! I would also like an single player option on the game so I can play bye myself. It's really hard to get friends and really hard to chat with them not going to lie. I love the fact that you can fly through the sky's. Love the app bye!</p>

      <p>GAME CRASH a lot!! Come on. Developers aren't even compensating the bugs and glitches the sky people encounter. The in game Wings are expensive like minimum 500 pesos to 1,500 pesos. Minimum wage people earn this and that's the lowest. That Greedy Company Sky Cotl uses your money for pretty. This is not a free to play game anymore. If you won't buy a Season Pass, you'll be left out playing for little petty candles. Maximum run is 20 candles but that's eating your three-hour life. Fix your game!</p>

      <p>Play with friends and meet people and explore a pretty universe. But once you go through the game there’s not a reason to come back. They could’ve added more to actually do in the game like more trials, platforming, mini games.. something.

   But instead they just add some short stories to walk through with extremely expensive cosmetics to buy and a painfully long farming machine that is getting candles to unlock things. Then they make this worse by having “traveling spirits” that come back with cosmetic options that you can only get for a few days and poof their gone. So this also incentivizes players to spend hours getting candles. 

   Fun for a few days as a new player but otherwise there is no reason to stay playing this game.</p>

      <h4>Almost 4 years playing and I just can't do it anymore, 1 stars (RaeUnit, Apple App Store, 2024-12-01)</h4>
      <p>I have been playing since 2021. I was hyperfixated on this game and obsessed to say the least. I loved when I loved this game and I am not kidding (unfortunately) when I say I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on this game over two accounts. I have an excel sheet to track my expenses. I bought every single pass since I started and almost all the iaps available. I was so INTO this game it actually was a problem.

I have thousands of hours invested too, but in that time I've witnessed just horrendous decision making by this company to prove they care less about their player base and more about impressing the shareholders and making a profit.

In beta and in live, there are MULTIPLE bugs I've made 4 dozen reports over for 2-3 years that never get fixed or addressed. I emailed the developers and was given canned responses "filler filler filler of we care about our players!!! BUT some things aren't a priority."

How long should I wait? If it's a paid item why must I wait 1-3 years for it to be normal? If your items are mostly behind passes we buy, even if it's 10 USD, then WHY should any item in game be broken for over a year?

Ignored cosmetic bugs is one thing, but game breaking bugs and increasing prices of IAPs is insane. I will admit they have lowered the prices on some stuff a LITTLE bit in the past two days of events we are currently in, which is good, but it is still too high. IAPs also seem to be skewed to be far better than the free to play items quality. It's almost sad.

A game breaking bug where we crash immediately loading in or some people forge candles that don't count to their total and essentially lose entire days of CR? Nothing. Days to fix it. If there is a glitch where we can forge more candles than usual or get 2x heart light or anything like that? Fixed within hours. 

I can't deal with it anymore. I am so utterly disappointed in this game. Fix your game. Give proper compensation. Show you care about longevity and that it isn't a flash in the pan or a slow burning down of all the foundation you have built over the years. 

Show you CARE about your players. 2-3 years of reporting THE SAME THINGS  over and over and over. For 4 years, putting my soul into offering suggestions, producing art or edits of things in beta to suggest changes, and giving feedback to try and impact a game that has consumed my LIFE for almost 4 years... FOUR YEARS. And it amounts to nothing. Frustration, disappointment, and waning confidence. That is all you have given me. 

Until change happens, this will be all that is left for me when I think about this game in the future looking into the past.</p>

      <p>If you were there for a season, you could work towards what you want and it wouldn't cost too many seasonal candles. IIRC You can always afford everything if you start day 1 and play every day
If you missed a season, the spirit you want could be gone for years
If you missed a season you'll be paying exorbitant amounts of candles to get what you want when the spirit comes back, if the spirit comes back
Zero way to actually work towards anything you want from past seasons. You just get to stew in it
Why are past seasons such a big deal? It's not just FOMO. Go compare the items and emotes in the base game vs. content from seasons. The content from different seasons have far more unique and interesting things going on with them
Are you new to the game and working through quests and past seasons (as directed by Hopeful Steward)? Excellent. You will now be repeatedly subjected to the experience of "Oh! That looks really neat! I hope I can get it" → "Oh, yeah it was a past season / past season ult".
Lit someone and see something cool? The previous point is bound to happen again when you go to the wiki and try to look up something they had.
"Don't focus on cosmetics so much" is a common thing I see said, but dressup is one of the few main things to do in the game. It kind of only makes sense that people gravitate towards wanting to put outfits together
What other games I've played that suffer from similar issues generally have a structure to them that lets you eventually get numb to it or shrug it off, but Sky's structure just keeps rubbing salt in the wound.</p>

      <p>The game is great and beautiful, however the game is mostly cinematic which isn’t bad. Yet sometimes I don’t want to watch the entire cut scene and there is no skip button. The controls on phone are also so wanky. I try to jump somewhere and my character just cannot comprehend that or something because they make the weakest jump to nowhere. Other than these two things the game is great and beautifully made.</p>

      <p>Sky has saved my life fr. It’s amazing graphics and immersive gameplay really changed my outlook on adventure games. The only one I’d play was Genshin Impact, and that’s only like 50% adventure. Anyway I was like “I bored” one day and just scrolling through the App Store, searching for something to cure my intense boredom; and then appeared Sky. I saw the download cloud button thing and than I was like “OH YEAH, I remember playing this game for like 5 seconds and then deleting it bc I got annoyed with the controls( I was 8 okay?). I’m kinda a lot older then 8 now by the way(but ain’t no way I’m telling some strangers my name). ANYWAY, I kinda have an addiction now and, owp, here comes the comments; Sky is a 100% recommendation for people who like adventure game. I haven’t finished the game but I hope to. Bye and have a great day! :D</p>

      <p>Started playing Sky during Season of Enchantment 2020 and since then I didn’t have an issue until the season of Moonie. Have always done ingame purchases. I purchased the season of Moonie, the game stated I had 12 hours before the season ended, came back before 12 hrs and the season had already ended. I contacted support for help but they declined my request to get the last item because I was short 2 candles. However their system is always glitchy and as you work hard to get the candles daily sometimes you don’t get them all. I have never complained about it since it wasn’t a big deal until now. But they refused to give me the last item because of two candles after I had spend money in the game for years. Fix your glitches and bugs! I am leaving the game and if later I decide to play I won’t be spending money.</p>

      <p>kdhfnvidnfkfhfhvnewofnc, I understand that you are frustrated but the game upgrades your cape! Also, you don’t need 3 years to get to level 7, I’m level 50 or something and it took me only a couple of days. I also had a semi meltdown when I reborn, but the game has a true ending my man! I got to the volcano thing and it ascended me with my levels. You’re kinda lying when you said you are finished saving people, no offense. Also this game is wonderful so if you don’t have the skill to get the ending, don’t do it.</p>

      <h4>The current state of the game…, 1 stars (minnchip, Apple App Store, 2024-12-03)</h4>
      <p>Sky is a cute, fun and calming game, I have had many wonderful experiences playing it with my friends over the years. However, I just can’t recommend the game in its current state. I am writing this review to call attention to problems that need addressing. Buckle in this is a long one

First- Sky is absolutely falling apart with glitches. Every update this past year has caused the game to break down in some type of way; mass server disconnections, the appearance of your progress being erased, quests breaking, unusable features, and even one that’s happening right now- a glitch that causes the daily candle timer to repeatedly reset, breaking player character animations and softlocking your in-game currency collection.
Another very bad glitch was one that caused the screen to strobe flash in an area, which posed danger for those with epilepsy. This did not get fixed for over a month. It’s common for glitches in Sky to go without being fixed for lengthy periods of time, despite the community’s constant reports. I cannot understand how these issues continue to happen, and can only hope more systems are implemented to fix their code and prevent against such glitches.

Also, it’s a fact that hundreds of live-service games regularly gift their communities premium currency as an apology for glitches, or to show respect for sticking with them through the process of planned maintenance. I can only remember Sky doing this once, and it was after a huge outcry by the community some months ago after the game was in an unplayable state for a week. Something so common in other games is strangely not a regular habit here. It becomes more upsetting when you consider how Sky events & items are limited-time, that a large number of players are paying customers, and players must make effort every day farming candles to get the fun items they want before it’s gone. If something out of the player’s control prevents them from playing the game, there is often no compensation for what was lost. And if there is, it’s inadequate. A measly 15 candles + extending farming events (which serves to make players log in and work to earn themselves more of what they lost out on, through no fault of their own) after a week of the game being unplayable isn’t very fair. The community often accuses the company of being stingy and asks why they can’t show more goodwill. One of many reasons why players feel disconnected with the company.

Continuing on that, yes a core gameplay of Sky is to collect candles, in-game currency used to purchase equipment and outfits. But more things seem to be getting changed which inconvenience the player with this. Player-created solutions to the repetitive farming get suddenly changed like locations for AFK idle light, or the controversial recent Grandma’s Table shared space removal. Harmless well-known strategies that help all players are patched out for unexplained reasons which makes people upset, and there is no “proper” alternative to those that’s offered. Events happen simultaneously which makes it difficult to save up candles and causes burnout from farming. Yet candles, cosmetics and more items are continually offered as expensive in-app purchases to buy with your real money.

It feels like the company doesn’t know what players want. The playerbase is stretched for their time, money, and feels like they are made to constantly experience FOMO. Of course, that is if they can play at all with the glitches.

Many of my friends stopped playing in the last year, and I am likely soon to follow. Sky is such a beautiful, unique and relaxing game for me, but its state now is unfortunate. 
Developers- if you read this, I sincerely hope this serves as constructive criticism for you. I would truly love if the game and your treatment to players can improve in the future & encourage me and many others to return someday.</p>

      <h4>Amazing game, a bit grindy, 5 stars (Jupiterrcollective, Apple App Store, 2025-01-18)</h4>
      <p>The game is amazing and has stunning visuals, I love the areas on the game- however once you play it more than once, it turns into a grinding game to get the cosmetics you want. Every day you can get 20 candles if you work hard, and most cosmetics are 60+, and there’s a lot of them when they return so it’s always a hard choice to chose what you can get and what you can’t.

Another issue is that the game has a lot of in app purchase items that are cool looking, and while it might not seem bad, most of these items are 5-20$ (usually just for one item too). However there is a lot of ingame items you can get, it just requires grinding and waiting until it returns.</p>

      <h4>Best game i’ve ever played. Hands down., 5 stars (hailyn <3, Apple App Store, 2025-01-29)</h4>
      <p>The surface of the game, for starters, is so cute. The character, the places, everything is so adorable. Along with this, it’s a super fun game to play when bored. I’ve played for a few years now and always find myself coming back to it. The quality of the game is amazing and I can’t believe this game is free; it’s my favorite game ever. I also love the concept of hearts and candles as currency, and they aren’t very hard to get if you play the game regularly. The avatars are very customizable aswell, as you can use your candles and hearts to buy cute accessories. Although there are in-game purchases, the game is completely playable without it and you can still get very cute things. Although I’ve been yet to buy something, I’ve been wanting to and I definitely suggest doing so in order to support the game (the in-game purchases are also so cute). The community of this game is also super friendly. I’ve met and talked to many people, all of which were super sweet and kind. Definitely the first game I suggest to someone who asks what to play, 10/10.</p>

      <h4>⚠️ Do NOT download if you have FOMO ⚠️, 3 stars (PedoRacistoDementioCheeto, Apple App Store, 2025-01-08)</h4>
      <p>I will start this off by saying I am so grateful for all the friends I’ve made through this game. It is a beautifully made game regarding the graphics and the maps altogether as well as the cosmetics you gain. Unfortunately, the latter mentioned is the exact issue I have with this game. 

I’ve tried to quit this game multiple times throughout my 4 years of playing and I am finally ending it here. Collecting 20 candles a day sounds like easy work until you realize that you’ve taken hours out of your day for this game. It’s difficult to collect all those candles and even harder when there are traveling spirits that come and go every 2 weeks as well as collecting candles for the season’s cosmetics. 

I BEG you, if you have FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) do NOT download this game at all. It has ruined my daily routine and sleep schedule. I never know if I’ll have enough candles for what I want and if I don’t, I spend days and nights trying to collect as much as I can while balancing my work, school, and home lifestyle. I feel forced to pay the price for more candles so I don’t miss out on anything. I am honestly mentally drained. 

The prices are another reason as I’ve realized that the IAP items are over the top expensive. Most of the items you buy correlate to real life items you can buy. Example being the $20 Mischief Broomstick. I can buy a real broom for that price. Although you aren’t forced to buy these items, I’ve spent over $80 dollars on this game already from FOMO and addiction, I’ll bet you even more if I do keep playing.

 All in all, I just can’t keep up with this game anymore. If you play this game for fun and not the cosmetics then I’d totally recommend it! Just know jumping onto that bandwagon is inevitable and it’s pure torture to experience it. Otherwise, I am done with this game. Thanks to TGC, but more importantly, thank you to the friends who kept me on this game longer than I intended.</p>

      <h4>Unknown_PlayerXD, 5 stars (-Moon star-, Apple App Store, 2025-01-19)</h4>
      <p>I can give a 5 stars, but the new version..is quite empty. The only thing I saw was a few players and spirits (I mean does it count), it like really empty and the doors won’t open. It is just me or everyone in the new version has the same problem.

Thank you.</p>

      <h4>What happened to my game after the update?, 5 stars (Mønico, Apple App Store, 2025-01-28)</h4>
      <p>I loaded the game today as of 1/28/2025. And when I opened it there was a new loading screen, I thought it was pretty cool until I finally made it to the home. That’s when thing were a bit weird. My realms were not showing and my constellation were all big and realm constellation were missing. I had to back track to get my stuff back in order and I’m still doing it as I type.  Non of my items or emote were missing and non of my paid items are gone so luckily that’s not a problem to worry about, but lots of stuff is out of order. Please fix this I really thought this game reset everything.😭🙏</p>

      <h4>My current issue., 4 stars (PlzHelpImBegging, Apple App Store, 2024-12-10)</h4>
      <p>I’m having a current issue with my sky account. I had deleted sky on accident and when trying to recover my account I had signed into a new different account and had linked this new account to my old one, thinking I could get my old one back. So now I can’t get my old account back, the new one is all I’m getting. The new one is linked to my old Game Center account, making my old account seemingly gone. Is it actually gone? Can I get some help here? Please I love this game and I’d hate to have to start again and loose everything.</p>

      <h4>Play daily, 1 stars (Shahs bivi, Apple App Store, 2024-12-04)</h4>
      <p>It’s been 3 years I’ve been with sky.  I’ve left them a lot of private feedback and filled out the surveys.  However I feel that the developers care most about people not getting free or easy light, instead of game play and interpersonal dynamics.  For example, they got rid of traditional rocket and sideways rocket, which made it so we could travel to some very awesome out of bounds places.   They also got rid of the ability to interact in out of bounds spaces, and if you do try to give your friend a hug, you are catapulted to another place than your friend.  However the servers are still unstable, recently we weren’t able to collect candles for days, and there are bugs that have persisted for months (I appear offline to friends), and some of the bugs that have come to live has been game dehabilitating. The quality control is not there.  The thoughtfulness that I loved about sky…. Seems to be fading.  And instead IAP prices are rising and there are more and more of them.  Also I don’t like how there aren’t truly feminine cosmetics.   I feel that in an effort to be accommodating to a certain player base it has discriminated against women who truly do want to be feminine.   Where is the lace, ten girly colors, the glitter.  And why does almost every full-length dress have a weird sleeve or no sleeves??? Why can’t a traditional dress be just that, feminine and beautiful????? 

Please understand I don’t even care about the candles anymore.  I want to have fun in OOBs with my friends.  And I want sideways rocket back.  I want to be able to relax instead of deal with bug after bug after bug, some of which persist for months.  I want to be able to CR and not be split from my friends or have server issues.  I want to be able to chat and not have the writing be delayed or disappear into an abyss.   

Please take your players into consideration here.   Be more deliberate, get rid of the bugs before live, and pay better attention to the details.   Don’t make it so you can’t have at least two complete outfits and new emotes with each season pass.  Give people their money’s worth.  And make your IAPs at least $5 less per item.  The prices keep going up and it’s not justified.   And if you are going to raise your prices at least make sure the game works !!!!!</p>

      <p>This game is cool. But the reason I gave this a 2 star. Is solely for the reason that I can’t play with my friends. It says you’re able to but I can’t find the option to invite my friend. I’ve looked everywhere and I can’t find an option. It just says I’m already friends with that player.</p>

      <p>Tbh started playing from 23rd July 2019 got every single item available iap to seasons etc id just say one thing its an endless loop that doesn’t end with no actual story nothing great in the game anymore full of bugs and everyone who says its free to play that is true but youll look like a noob if you play like that idk if you’d be okay being like that so overall how much money the company is generating vs how much effort is being put into the game in terms of server management bug fixes its not recommended most old players have left the game knowing the true concept behind it it’s basically a cosmetic showdown / virtual socialization platform that’s all with lots of bugs</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing since season of remembrance and krill’s are a pain like when I was a moth I was no no way I’m going in, by the way THAT WAS SMART! Now I got like 9 flaps and I just destroy the wasteland but Eden there’s a different story. I get my second account and just fly over… before I found my second account thanks to passage season I just get spotted EVERY TIME. Well I think I know why… I think krill’s are a obstacle preparing you for Eden and that’s smart but why the heck do they take your light? Why not take you home or restart the area? Thanks to the wasteland my heart just explodes when I see the krill and when it spots the manta. Still sad why do krill eat MANTAS!?!?! I’m sad but at least you get to see it over and over. :)</p>

It gives you a tutorial on how to move and stuff, I also like the concept of the game. It’d peaceful, but adventurous. I like how you can also make friends! I made some today. I look forward to future updates! Love, Jennie <3</p>

      <p>I've noticed something odd when I play instruments in Sky: the sound is clear on my screen, but for others, it seems off. It sounds slower and just doesn't match what I'm hearing. I really want everyone to experience the music as I do, so I hope this can be fixed. It would make sharing the experience so much better!</p>

      <h4>You don't have to own everything., 5 stars (dvdvante, Apple App Store, 2025-02-01)</h4>
      <p>bad news first: game is prone to odd bugs, they range from unnoticeable to gamebreaking

good news: this is the only game i know of that really feels like coming to another world. the maps are huge and picturesque which is really important when the main thing youre doing is flying everywhere. no flight abilities are paywalled. there are mountains of cosmetics to collect without soending ANY money (that said, you can expect that popular or more detailed cosmetics are paid w real currency). 

new players: dont fall for the trap that i see so many people do where they feel like they have to grind themselves to dust to collect every single cosmetic as it comes along. half the stuff you own sits in a closet untouched once you get far enough. event items return next year because these events always come back. HOWEVER the fomo in this game can be brutal for a lot of people so keep that in mind

love this game and spending time with my friends in it. 10/10</p>

      <p>I have played sky for about a year and a half, and it is such an amazing and peaceful game. But, like all games there are issues. First, it seems more recently there is bugs affecting the game. And it seems like they are focusing on adding more to the game than fixing these issues. Second, everything is expensive and it seems all the nice stuff require money. Other than these I think it is a pretty awesome game!!</p>

I almost became a YouTuber for this game. I have been playing for 5 years and it can get boring but when your friends are around, you can do anything. Oh and another thing, IF YOU DOWNLOAD THIS GAME WRITE THIS DOWN AND REMEMBER IT. Do NOT spend your candles on friends. Don’t just don’t. I was you once and I have a spending problem lol but Still. AMAZING 5 STAR GAME. Well I hope I see ya in the skys!</p>
