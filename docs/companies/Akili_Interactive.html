            <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive, founded in 2011 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is a pioneering company in the digital therapeutics space. The company merges neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create innovative treatments for cognitive impairments. Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is the first prescription video game treatment authorized by the FDA for pediatric ADHD. The company also offers <strong>EndeavorOTC</strong>, an over-the-counter version aimed at adults with ADHD.</p>
<p>Akili operates primarily on a B2C model, targeting individuals with ADHD and their families. The company generates revenue through the sale of its digital therapeutic products, both prescription-based and over-the-counter. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $1.2 million coming from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter &amp; Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has faced significant challenges, including sluggish sales and financial losses, leading to multiple rounds of layoffs. As of early 2024, Akili's market cap has significantly declined, trading below $1 <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics</h2>
<p>On May 29, 2024, Akili announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by Virtual Therapeutics for approximately $34 million, translating to $0.4340 per share in cash. This acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, pending certain conditions, including a majority of Akili shares being tendered <a href="https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/news-and-events/news/2024/05/announcements-lifesciences-ma-akili-interactive-to-be-acquired">(Goodwin Law, 2024)</a>. Following the merger, Akili will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics, which focuses on mental health solutions through immersive gaming <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-120000485.html">(Business Wire, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Workforce Reductions</h2>
<p>In April 2024, Akili announced it would lay off 46% of its workforce due to sluggish sales of its video game treatment for ADHD. This marked the third significant round of layoffs in less than a year, reflecting ongoing challenges in building a sustainable business model in the digital therapeutics space <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>. The company has shifted its strategy to focus on over-the-counter sales of its products, including EndeavorOTC, which targets adults with ADHD <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Aguilar, STAT News, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $1.2 million coming from EndeavorOTC and $523,000 from EndeavorRx. However, the company also faced a net loss of $59.5 million for the year <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter &amp; Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>. The financial struggles have been compounded by a significant drop in stock price, leading to a delisting notice from Nasdaq in October 2023 <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Reuter &amp; Taylor, MedTech Dive, 2024)</a>.</p>
