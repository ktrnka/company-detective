        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Sentiment: Positive</h2>
<h3>Product Effectiveness</h3>
<ul>
<li>"We use it for monitoring. It's important to be able to monitor from outside the company to give an idea of what our clients experience. It is extremely helpful when a client contacts us and says there is a problem and we can review ThousandEyes to say that the agent in that part of the world also had a problem, but other agents didn't." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1chqis8/what_is_your_experience_with_thousandeyes/l25vqz8/">(Bubbasdahname, Reddit, 2024-05-01)</a></li>
