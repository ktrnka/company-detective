<li>"Jira represents heavy process, rubber stamps, product managers, goofy user feedback, obstruction to getting things done and deadlines." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l4d2v/">(xnadevelopment, Reddit, 2020-09-25)</a></li>

<h3>Performance Issues</h3>

<li>"Jira is ok apart from the fact that it's so god damn slow." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/izu5u3/everyone_hates_jira_but_no_one_stops_using_it/g6l4xqr/">(nagai, Reddit, 2020-09-25)</a></li>

<li>"The biggest fault I have with JIRA it's licensing. I'm responsible for a 10,000 user instance, and if a team of ten wants a plugin, well... Better go find a few grand." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3n2sc1/why_fogbugz_lost_to_jira/cvken1q/">(tjsr, Reddit, 2015-10-01)</a></li>
