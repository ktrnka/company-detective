        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>User Experience Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"With new version another annoying thing comes up: clicking to notification, redirects you to notification list but not to the ticket itself (as previous versions)... In desktop everything loads too fast. But in mobile app you need to wait for loading everything (photo, video, status, assignee, etc). Currently, it's too annoying, almost you can't use it." <a href="https://google_play/8f92e759-f899-45b3-9f24-c598a1fa2859">(Murad Mustafayev, Google Play Store, 2024-10-13)</a></li>

<li>"The app is kinda trash because its just Trello reskinned. It needs a calendar view or a timeline view so you can see your DEADLINES CLEARLY on a calendar, but the app doesnt offer that." <a href="https://google_play/25f9c915-4070-4c10-a9b2-c654e34ae285">(Marjorie Pierce, Google Play Store, 2024-08-11)</a></li>

<li>"Compared to the desktop version, overly complex to use. Everyday jobs like logging time worked apparently only possible by switching to the desktop edition." <a href="https://google_play/fe17f718-8fb2-4ccb-ad81-a372a1474b04">(Ralf Oltmanns, Google Play Store, 2024-08-25)</a></li>
<li>"The largest issue with the mobile app is speed. There seems to be no caching at all." <a href="https://google_play/aca25d47-47ea-41d3-9f05-340efb5812ce">(James Blackburn, Google Play Store, 2024-10-09)</a></li>
<li>"So clunky, that you cannot achieve anything on it. Rather wait until I can use a laptop." <a href="https://google_play/e99af5fe-f32f-484e-9df0-3da7c4999357">(Neal WP, Google Play Store, 2024-08-27)</a></li>

      <p>With new version another annoying thing comes up: clicking to notification, redirects you to notification list but not to the ticket itself (as previous versions)... In desktop everything loads too fast. But in mobile app you need to wait for loading everything (photo, video, status, assignee, etc). Maybe have some solutions (delete cache, reinstall, etc) or it's a default behavior? Currently, it's too annoying, almost you can't use it.</p>

      <p>The largest issue with the mobile app is speed. There seems to be no caching at all. Every time you have slightly slow internet (even 5g), you get problem after problem after problem. With slow loading times, every single element you click, seems to download a whole web page. It seems so inefficient. All my issue is, is like 10kb of text but it ends up taking multiple seconds to load. Makes me want to use something more primitive...</p>

      <p>Ok, but seems to have some bugs. I can't open projects or boards. If I try to open a project it says I don't have permission, even though I can open that same project on web while logged in to the same account. If I try to open a board nothing happens. I click on it from the home screen / search and it just ignores my click. There are a few others that I can't remember right now, but those two alone remove a lot of the usefulness of the app for me. I can open tickets, so I have at least that.</p>

      <p>Horrible customer experience in terms of charging, they have multiple side limits for stuff that they never tell you about when you start using features. For instance, they have a limit of automation rule RUNS, so you might get started organising work with certain automations and one day (without notice) you have to pay to keep doing your work. If you are a startup or small business with limited budget, I'd urge you to try a different platform.</p>

      <p>Why is the default comment type "Add internal note" instead of "reply to customer" when you hit "reply" on a user's message??? I'm so tired of replying, realizing I just left an internal note, then deleting and re-replying to make sure they see it 😩. Also, switching between projects is really clunky and makes it a real pain when you support two projects (development project and help desk, in my case). I just want to check the support queue without having to switch projects 10 times a day 😩</p>

      <p>Love this site on desktop. The app is kinda trash because its just Trello reskinned. It needs a calendar view or a timeline view so you can see your DEADLINES CLEARLY on a calendar, but the app doesnt offer that. If they do, Its very hard to find or enable. Update: i tried signing in on my ipad and this app does not play nice with the device. So much so that it thought i registered for a 30 day premium version. Which i did not. Thats not ok guys.</p>

I can't crate a task, can't customize visible fields, can't filter by anything other than Assignee, and worst of all it has trouble synchronizing tasks.
