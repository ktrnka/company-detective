        <h1>About Indeed</h1>
<p>Indeed is a leading employment-related metasearch engine for job listings, founded on November 1, 2004, by Paul Forster and Rony Kahan <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. The company is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas, with additional offices in Austin, Dublin, London, San Mateo, New York, and Stamford. Indeed operates in more than 50 countries and 28 languages, covering 94% of global GDP. It is recognized as the #1 source of external hires for employers, with over 140 million monthly unique visitors, which is double the traffic of the next leading job site <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed provides a platform for job seekers to access millions of job listings from thousands of company websites and job boards for free. The company generates revenue through a pay-for-performance recruitment advertising network, driving millions of targeted applicants to jobs across various fields. This model is considered the most cost-effective source of candidates for thousands of companies <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indeed">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company serves a wide range of employers, from small businesses to large corporations, looking to fill job vacancies efficiently. Indeed's services for employers include access to insightful data, tools for crafting job descriptions, and a dashboard for managing job postings and recruitment processes <a href="https://uk.indeed.com/employers/login">(Indeed for Employers UK dashboard, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Chris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been vocal about the company's challenges and the rationale behind recent layoffs, emphasizing the need to simplify operations and reignite growth <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. Hyams's leadership is crucial as Indeed navigates its current restructuring phase.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Layoffs and Restructuring</h2>
<p>Indeed has been undergoing significant restructuring, including layoffs. In May 2024, the company announced the layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, representing about 8% of its workforce <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. This followed a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, which accounted for 15% of the workforce, due to a downturn in job postings <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>. The layoffs are primarily concentrated in the U.S., particularly within the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) and Go-to-Market teams. CEO Chris Hyams stated that these actions are part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Commitment to Connecticut</h2>
<p>Despite the layoffs, Indeed has reaffirmed its commitment to Connecticut, maintaining its co-headquarters there. The company has stated that there will be no changes to its real estate footprint in the state, with Stamford remaining a key sales office integral to its long-term plans <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Challenges and Innovations</h2>
<p>Indeed has faced challenges with some of its product offerings, particularly with the rollout of a new payment scheme called "pay per application." This model, intended to allow employers to pay only for accepted applications, encountered difficulties, especially for small businesses struggling with the approval process <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Recent Partnerships and Initiatives</h2>
<p>Indeed has been involved in various initiatives and partnerships to enhance its offerings. In June 2020, the company partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal to assist job seekers and employers during the pandemic <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. Additionally, Indeed has been leveraging AI to improve the recruiting process and has partnered with Business Insider on "The Better Work Project" to help workforce leaders and HR managers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-insider-and-indeed-partner-on-the-better-work-project-2024-10">(Business Insider Press Room, 2024-10-22)</a>.</p>
<h2>Legal and Market Developments</h2>
<p>Indeed has been involved in legal disputes, such as a lawsuit against ZipRecruiter for spreading false information about its website <a href="https://www.law.com/texaslawyer/2024/10/08/ziprecruiter-is-trying-to-sabotage-indeeds-website-new-lawsuit-claims/">(Adolfo Pesquera, 2024-10-08)</a>. The company is also adapting to market trends, with reports of increased demand for truck driver jobs and a focus on AI and skills-first hiring <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0725/1461729-indeed-survey-on-demand-for-jobs/">(RTE.ie, 2024-07-25)</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/how-ai-is-rewriting-the-rules-of-recruitment">(Business Insider, 2024-11-01)</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Indeed is at a pivotal moment, facing significant restructuring and layoffs while striving to simplify its operations and reignite growth. The company's commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and its ongoing efforts to innovate its job search platform will be crucial as it adapts to the evolving job market landscape.</p>

<h2>Mixed Sentiment about Indeed</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I find it frustrating that they don't show us our scores. Also, there's a HUGE difference between a score of 380 and 800, and to wrap that up in one rating is absolutely stupid." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/joumd3q/">(staciep248, Reddit, 2023-07-13)</a></li>
<li>"I noticed that all the ones I got 'Expert' on now say 'Proficient' and I was like... why did they bring my 'grade' down?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lawkzow/">(taylormarie213, Reddit, 2024-06-29)</a></li>
<li>"I have noticed within the past year or so that ALL of my previous assessments that were expert or highly proficient have now been changed to proficient." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/lk2ms9f/">(andreatee314, Reddit, 2024-08-26)</a></li>
<li>"Indeed's website for employers states: 'Indeed Assessments score levels are Proficient and Completed. A score of “incomplete” will be given when a candidate has started but has not completed an assessment yet.'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/12iqrkc/is_proficient_the_highest_score_on_indeed_skill/kc7rfl0/">(None, Reddit, 2023-12-06)</a></li>

<h2>Comparisons with Other Job Platforms</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I’ve found that LinkedIn is better for white collar full-time, permanent employment. Indeed is better for gig work, temp jobs, part time work, and jobs that hire quickly and have high turnover, such as minimum wage jobs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/10ufp5w/linkedin_vs_indeed/j7h2qe9/">(gouwbadgers, Reddit, 2023-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"In my experience Indeed is the best in terms of number of jobs, but LinkedIn is better for quality. You don't have to filter through as much rubbish." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dddqw5y/">(thejosiekiller, Reddit, 2017-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"Indeed is still the gold standard, so the answer in my opinion is no, there aren't any alternatives that are better." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dddpyic/">(moonpuncher, Reddit, 2017-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"Indeed has to be the most popular. Back in the day career builder and monster were hot but killed their stuff with ad space and spamming you with fake postings." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e2bbjil/">(Cainga, Reddit, 2018-07-13)</a></li>

      <p>A bit hard to make the resume delete pre-determined skills. There were so many to delete, but because In some form they were able to send jobs to you in more fields than I was looking for. Solved it by deleting any job I had experience in, but was not looking in that field. on the whole, it's better than some other job sites!</p>
