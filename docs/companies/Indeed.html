        <h1>About Indeed</h1>
<p>Indeed is a leading job search platform that connects employers with job seekers, facilitating the hiring process across various industries. The company is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. Indeed was founded in 2004 and has grown to become a vital resource for recruitment, providing tools and insights to enhance the hiring process.</p>
<p>As of May 2024, Indeed has undergone significant organizational changes, including layoffs affecting approximately 1,000 employees, which represents about 8% of its workforce <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. This follows a previous layoff of around 2,200 employees in March 2023, accounting for 15% of the company <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed offers a variety of services for employers, including job posting and management, access to insightful data such as average salaries for similar jobs, information on job seeker interest and competing employers, and tools for crafting compelling job descriptions. The platform provides a dashboard for employers to manage their job listings and access valuable analytics to improve their hiring strategies.</p>
<p>Indeed serves a wide range of customers, from small businesses to large corporations, helping them find qualified candidates efficiently. The company operates on a B2B model, generating revenue through services offered to employers.</p>
<p>Despite recent layoffs, Indeed has reported stable profitability following previous cost-saving measures. The company aims to streamline operations to better serve its mission of helping 100 million people find jobs by 2030 <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Chris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been involved in leading the company through recent organizational changes, including significant layoffs. Hyams has emphasized the need for the company to simplify its structure and improve decision-making processes to reignite growth and align with its marketplace strategy <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Layoffs and Organizational Changes</h2>
<p>Indeed has recently laid off approximately 1,000 employees, primarily in the United States, within the Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) and Go-to-Market teams. This decision is part of a strategy to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. The layoffs follow a previous reduction of 2,200 employees in March 2023 <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance and Market Position</h2>
<p>Despite the layoffs, Indeed has maintained stable profitability. CEO Chris Hyams noted that while the global economy has shown signs of improvement, the company is still not positioned for sustainable growth, necessitating these organizational changes <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Developments and Challenges</h2>
<p>Indeed's product offerings include a range of tools for job seekers and employers. However, the company has faced challenges with some of its experimental payment schemes, such as the "pay per application" model, which encountered difficulties during its rollout in 2022 <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Commitment to Community and Workforce</h2>
<p>Indeed has reiterated its commitment to its Connecticut headquarters and the local workforce, despite the layoffs. The company has previously partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal during the pandemic <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Executive Insights</h2>
<p>CEO Chris Hyams expressed the emotional weight of the decision to lay off employees, acknowledging the impact on employees' lives and emphasizing the company's mission to help people find jobs <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Indeed is navigating a challenging landscape marked by workforce reductions and the need for organizational simplification. While the company has achieved stable profitability, it faces ongoing challenges in aligning its product offerings with market demands. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these factors when evaluating Indeed's future potential and stability in the job search market.</p>

<li>"In my experience and in discussion with friends, more focused sites like DICE, LinkedIn and even Craigslist get better results for both employers and candidates." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yaffi/major_indeedcom_filter_flaw_affects_employers_and/e29ns8b/">(None, Reddit, 2018-07-12)</a></li>
<li>"Indeed is still the gold standard, so the answer in my opinion is no, there aren't any alternatives that are better." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5savjx/having_little_success_with_indeedcom_are_there/dddpyic/">(moonpuncher, Reddit, 2017-02-06)</a></li>

      <p>Using indeed has been a very eventful experience honestly it needs a little bit more reproduction because in all honesty some of the jobs that you apply for on indeed do and do not work some are fishing some are not even accessible others have you go on to their website but it was supposed to be told that indeed was an easy apply application site if these companies do want you to go ahead and apply at their own site and they should not post on indeed if that's what you guys want to do</p>

      <p>This app is quite literally Tinder but for jobs. I can almost guarantee that AI loads your info. Placed over 30 job applications and have had no updates on any job. Or it times out the application entirely and says "not selected by employer" meaning one of two things. 1. The employee simply found someone else. 2. The AI system on this app fails to upload onto the employers page and it times out/ won't upload because maybe you have a different font choice, color, and key words. Terrible app!!</p>
