<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Chris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been vocal about the company's challenges and strategic direction, particularly during times of organizational change. Hyams has emphasized the importance of simplifying the company's structure to improve efficiency and drive growth. He has also reiterated the company's mission to help people find jobs, describing it as a "profound privilege" <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Layoffs and Restructuring</h2>
<p>Indeed has recently undergone significant organizational changes, including layoffs and restructuring. On May 13, 2024, the company announced it would lay off approximately 1,000 employees, about 8% of its workforce. This decision was attributed to a "global slow-down in hiring" and the need to simplify the organization to enhance decision-making and growth potential <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>. The layoffs primarily affected teams in the U.S., particularly within Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) and Go-to-Market teams.</p>
<p>This recent layoff follows a significant reduction in March 2023, where Indeed cut about 15% of its workforce, equating to around 2,200 employees, due to a decline in job postings. Despite these challenges, the company is now operating with stable profitability but requires restructuring to achieve sustainable growth <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Strategy and Future Goals</h2>
<p>Indeed's leadership is focused on simplifying the organizational structure to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency. Chris Hyams emphasized the importance of these changes for the company's long-term strategy, stating, "Our new structure will help us to simplify and work more effectively as one team, reignite growth in revenue, and drive toward our 2030 goal to help 100 million people get jobs" <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Partnerships and Community Engagement</h2>
<p>Indeed has a history of engaging with local communities and governments. For instance, in June 2020, the company partnered with the state of Connecticut to create a custom jobs portal aimed at helping job seekers and employers during the pandemic recovery. This partnership reflects Indeed's commitment to supporting workforce development and community engagement <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Indeed is currently navigating a challenging landscape marked by workforce reductions and organizational restructuring. While the company has faced significant layoffs, its leadership is focused on simplifying operations and reigniting growth. The commitment to community partnerships and the mission to assist job seekers remain central to Indeed's strategy as it adapts to the changing job market. Prospective candidates and investors should monitor these developments closely, as they will likely influence Indeed's future performance and market position <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(Comprehensive Analyst Report on Indeed)</a>.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using Indeed for several months, and I’m very disappointed with the results. Despite applying to numerous jobs, I’ve rarely heard back from employers, and the ones that do respond seem irrelevant to my qualifications or interests. The algorithm suggests positions that don’t match my skills or location preferences, and many postings are outdated or duplicates. Additionally, the lack of transparency about why applications are rejected makes it hard to improve. While the platform is easy to use, it hasn’t helped me secure any opportunities. I expected more from such a well-known job board but have had much better success with other resources.</p>

      <p>As far as ‘Support’, then perhaps add an easier way to notify the correct department that can repair the App, server, etcetera when the App crashes. My App just did a little bit ago while I was typing in different jobs that I wanted to add.

As far as ‘Contact’, then perhaps have an easier way to contact someone rather than having a bunch of FAQs. The speed at which the day by day demand for production is increases and finds itself trying to catch up with the demand for answers to solutions. 

I would say this is mostly because, many people simply cannot process only, but so much information at any given time. People need people to communicate with along with reading.

I’ll stop here. I’m not intending to belittle anyone here, but I think this would be a little too much to process if I were to keep on explaining. If not, then too much from what I tried to explain.

Besides these 2 issues, thanks Indeed for the other dynamics that you provide and your support of us out here looking for jobs, employment, and careers.</p>

      <p>For one I am getting A LOT of texts saying “I have a job for you” all bad punctuation and grammar and obviously scams. I wasn’t getting ANY of these before using the app so I know it’s fake employer accounts looking at my info. You guys need to verify these companies better.

For job searchers- hide your resume/info as soon as you put it in because it takes one fraud “employer “ to swipe it and sell it to a bunch of other fraudsters. I have made my info no longer searchable but the damage is already so done. 

Second the filters don’t really work that well. I get odd search results. When trying to expand my search I get the same types of jobs over and over. I am sure I am not being shown all of the jobs out there I am capable of working. 

Lastly, you cant see the company info and reviews in the app. You have to use a desktop to see that. The tab in the app that says “company” does nothing and the company name is not hyperlinked to the company profile page.

Overall, I don’t recommend the app because the cons outweighs the pros, especially with regards to all of the scam texts I am receiving now.</p>

      <p>I have gotten many jobs thru indeed over the years. I have learned never put your full address on your resume, or personal phone #. Why?  More than once i have had my info sold without my consent. Many people wonder why they’re not getting employed and that’s because they are too strict abt what they want. Most people can be quickly employed in less than a month. 

One minus of their app is that it forces you to sign in. Nope. I will use website instead. Then the website is just as annoying. It forces you to use the app every click or if it detects it the app will force load. No thank you i will stick to website. Some times i just want to browse. I do not want people to see what i am looking for. 

Indeed is a good app but there are also a ton of fake or ghost job postings. People often fall for these and get their info stolen or waisted time. 

Some scam posts. Remember an employer will never request payment for an interview. These are scams.</p>

Would also ask for ability to sort even more, and really push companies to be forthright with pay. Please consider pushing everyone to use streamlined application processes. The effort spent by applicants to apply two places, produce a cover letter, tailor everything to a job and then just find out it won’t pay a living wage is so disappointing. If we want people to get back to work (also fill jobs) and cut down on wasted time, the ideas are there.</p>

      <h4>Fake Jobs, 2 stars (Jayjaymaysun, Apple App Store, 2024-12-19)</h4>
      <p>I found a job on here once back in 2020, that when the jobs were legit. But now I’m back I’m getting contacted by marketing sales agencies that I never applied to, I don’t know how they got my information. A lot of “jobs” are hiding behind customer representatives or customer support jobs and not openly admitting they’re marketing schemes. Secondly, I’ve been on here for months since march 2024, it’s now Dec 2024 and these jobs are fake, no one is hiring.</p>

When it finds a match or gives you a “your skills could be useful in this field” alert, the suggested job is something you never done before and none of the skill boxes you checked have any correlation.</p>

Remember just because an employee says their business need help and encourages you to apply does not mean at all that the company or business has any intention of hiring at all.</p>

Con: the fact that this app still does not have a dark mode feature is my mind blowing to me. It also does not stick to setting you selected. If I don’t want to see a job with certain characteristics; there’s a reason why I made the choice. Hopefully this app would get better soon.</p>
