            <h1>About Indeed</h1>
<p>Indeed is a prominent job search platform with headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and Austin, Texas. The company was founded in 2004 and has grown to become a significant player in the employment sector, offering services to both job seekers and employers. Indeed operates on a B2C and B2B model, providing a platform for job seekers to find employment opportunities and for employers to post job listings and manage recruitment processes.</p>
<p>As of May 2024, Indeed employed approximately 12,500 people, following a layoff of about 1,000 employees, which represented 8% of its workforce <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. The layoffs were part of a strategic move to simplify the organization and improve decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Indeed generates revenue primarily through job posting fees and premium services offered to employers. The company has introduced various product features, such as "Pay per Application," which allows employers to pay only for accepted applications, although this model has faced challenges, particularly with small businesses <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<p>The platform is widely used, with a significant number of job seekers and employers relying on its services. Indeed's products are distributed online, making them accessible to a global audience. Over time, the company has faced both internal and external challenges, including financial restructuring and criticism over certain business practices <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575">(Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Chris Hyams is the CEO of Indeed. He has been vocal about the company's recent layoffs and the strategic reasons behind them. Hyams has emphasized the need for organizational simplification to enhance decision-making and support revenue growth <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>. His leadership is crucial as Indeed navigates its current challenges and seeks sustainable growth.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Layoffs</h2>
<p>In May 2024, Indeed announced the layoff of approximately 1,000 employees, primarily in the U.S., affecting teams in Research &amp; Development and Go-to-Market functions. This decision followed a previous round of layoffs in 2023, where 2,200 employees were let go due to a slowdown in hiring and revenue loss <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>. CEO Chris Hyams stated that these measures were necessary to streamline operations and position the company for future growth <a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/indeed-to-lay-off-1000-employees/3289652/">(NBC Connecticut, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Developments</h2>
<p>Indeed has faced challenges with its "Pay per Application" model, which has been problematic for small businesses struggling with the application approval process. This issue has raised concerns about the company's ability to innovate effectively in a competitive market <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/indeed-layoffs-job-market/716166/">(HR Dive, 2024-05-15)</a>.</p>
<h2>Market Position and User Sentiment</h2>
<p>Despite the layoffs, Indeed remains a widely used platform. However, there have been mixed sentiments regarding the company's practices. Concerns have been raised about the potential sale of user information to recruiters, leading to unsolicited contact from recruiting firms <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539575">(Y Combinator News, 2024-09-04)</a>. Additionally, Indeed faced backlash for a controversial job ad deemed discriminatory, prompting the company to reaffirm its commitment to inclusivity <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/verify/racist-jobs-ad-stating-no-african-americans-needed-was-posted-on-indeed/77-ec9635d3-f236-41ee-abe0-ad3f23defb72">(First Coast News, 2024-02-27)</a>.</p>

      <p>Indeed used to be a respectable, dependable app for job seekers. They effectively pushed all other job boards out of the market with their ads and promo. Once they attained this position, they allowed unvetted, impertinent and sometimes criminal entities to prey on users. Job hunting is a stressful and vulnerable time in one’s life and Indeed had made it clear in the last few years that profit is their only concern and they have only abject apathy and contempt for the suckers who use it.</p>

I’ve had prospective employers stand me up for an in person interview, also had employers message me, I reply, and then NOTHING. Lots of unprofessionalism. How come these unprofessional people HAVE JOBS and I don’t - when I would never treat job applicants that way. Also, the app ignores my preferences.

If a resume is of worries I trust and believe indeed is suitable to extend the job opportunities to fill that need. Some say that working isn’t needed in order to have a good foundation under oneself, I doubt many agree. But with Indeed those worries can be eliminated, maybe not right away, but with time if anything. -To trust!</p>

I get notifications for jobs that I don’t qualify for, for jobs that are not even anywhere near my expertise, or jobs that I’ve already been filled. I am an excellent employee. I am an excellent interviewer, the reason that none of these employers have offered me a job is because during the interviews that I get, I find out that there are requirements that I don’t meet that indeed never told me about. So I will be taking an old school approach and just filling out applications the good old-fashioned way because apparently indeed is not what it cracks up to be.</p>

      <p>This app is terrible.. it’s no longer managed at all.. search is broken, doesn’t take criteria into account.. it’s all old listings they refuse to take down even at the businesses request due to all positions being filled.. I’ve literally wasted days calling all these places just to be told they don’t know anything about a hiring post and they aren’t hiring.  Even all the “entry level” jobs all have years of experience required, or require degrees, licensing, cdl, etc.. literally nothing in there entry level.</p>

Company states this is an issue with the app.  When they move a potential employee from one section to another the email(s) are automatically sent out stating that you were not selected ect.

      <p>2 yrs ago I got a nice little job off of indeed. I was pregnant & after having my son the place that hired me was closing their business. Since March of this year I have been applying for job after job after job on indeed. Out of 100s & 100s of jobs I applied to not even one place called me back. Not even ONE! my resume is absolutely amazing! It is now almost October. Not one place has called me. My sister recently showed me a video how indeed does this now on purpose. They are now posting dead jobs or fake jobs..& the video mentioned that’s why tons of people do not receive calls back anymore. Makes total sense, bc there is honestly no way that not a single company has reached out to me. And when I tell you I’m applying, I mean I’ve submitted my resume to about 20 different companies each week or every 2 weeks since March!!!! Indeed is honestly trash now. I used to really love this app & you could always find a job & get hired rather quickly. Not anymore. For this entire year, I’ve had zero luck & that’s pretty odd. I will not be using indeed any longer. In fact, I have downloaded a new app to try because this is absolutely ridiculous. Good riddance indeed.</p>

Indeed consistently shows me jobs Im not qualified for or not interested in that type of work and hardly shows me any jobs that are relevant to me. 

SKILLS TEST ARE JOKES!!!
They have you sometimes take a skills test ranging from sometimes 5 mins even up to 25 mins, JUST FOR AN EMPLOYER NOT TO EVEN LOOK AT IT OR CALL BACK. 
COMPLETELY WASTE OF YOUR TIME!!!

Employers are very unresponsive, the most you get anymore is that it would say the employer viewed your application or they would just message you on indeed to apply on their website and wouldn’t hear anything back even after you submitted the online application through the company’s website.</p>

It doesn’t make any sense yes your profiles missing certain qualifications but we’ll just keep recommending jobs that clearly don’t fit your resume.</p>

You’re merely a card on a computer screen, employers are really picky and don’t give shots to people. You can’t see reviews of companies, you will get the same job results, and you will even get results from careers and jobs that aren’t related to your skills at all. Lastly, why is everything based on years of experience? You can do something for years sure but it doesn’t mean you’re good at it.</p>

      <p>We used to really love using indeed & don’t want to have to stop using / supporting it- we PLEAD for anonymity back, in regards to when we’re applying to different positions & companies- there should be NO REASON to notify anyone’s current employers about when people are applying to other places. This isn’t a one-off issue, we need resolution. Bring back discretion! ASAP please. 

Here are some real examples from real people, but their identities are remaining anonymous. 

* Can confirm. I was pulled aside twice by my managers and asked why I’m “active” on indeed… indeed shouldn’t be notifying my employers 😭 why not keep my activity private

** I was fired recently out of the blue they couldn’t give me a real reason. I was applying for jobs heavily right before it happened….COULD THIS BE WHY?! 

***Yep my old manager always used to gossip about which girls had been updating their Indeed recently and started cutting their hours

****  This needs to be more known, don’t want a law suit, but it’s really people’s livelihoods at stake. 

PLEASE FIX THIS VALID CONCERN !</p>

      <p>This app likes to ask you what your specifications and parameters are for what you need a new job but doesn’t listen to a single one. I keep telling it over and over I don’t want anything less than $17 an hour because otherwise I can’t survive off of that and it keeps showing me jobs for 12 and 13 and 14 and $15 an hour update your app. it will literally ask me if I want to refresh the page after adding new parameters and I’ll scroll down one job and it’ll show something I can’t work with</p>

      <p>I think job postings should show the starting wage not what they think you earn after tips, because they continue on saying that tips varies from location, position and hours. It should be a requirement that starting wages are shown without tips but mention tips can vary, if they cannot guarantee the wage they show it shouldn’t be posted.
Job searching is horrendous, oven been using this app to find a job for 3 years now and absolutely nothing shows up that’s relevant to my skill level and the type of jobs that do show all require things I do not have experience in. This app is only good in making you feel utterly useless to the family you are trying to help support. The workforce isn’t fit for new mothers with no help and no babysitters.</p>

      <p>Indeed needs to do better with job listings because there’s a lot of jobs on this app that are not showing if the job is legit or not. A lot of companies post fake jobs on this app, call people in for interviews but don’t call them back to offer them positions at the company. Indeed needs to do better with using ai to help job seekers find jobs because ai isn’t helping companies find good workers and the ai isn’t working with filtering potential employees.

      <h4>No copying…, 1 stars (apply annoyed, Apple App Store, 2024-08-24)</h4>
      <p>When I’m looking at a possible job location I copy the address and then put it on Google. I do this for multiple reasons. 1. Is to see where this job location is, 2. It’s to see if I know the location very well, 3. Can a bus take me there if I’m having bus problems, 4. Are there side walks, etc. Now the issue is, Indeeds app doesn’t allow you to copy the address from their app. So I have to pull up Google and flip between indeeds app and googles app to get the address down to get a view. What indeed could be doing about this is allowing us to copy the address so we can get that view when we paste it in googles search engine. But that makes too much sense cause I’m a woman who thinks of these things. Yes most of the job listings has a location with a Google symbol, but when you take it it doesn’t take you anywhere. So you need to do the painful switching from app to app to get the address down so you CAN find where the job location is.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using indeed for years to get insights on opinions of workers, salary ranges, and job descriptions.  Recently I have known someone to write a review for their employer and it wasn’t painted as sunshine and rainbows.  There were no curse words, no specifics given about any person in the company, and yet it was taken down.  It raises the question of how much of what people are saying about these companies is being filtered out to prevent negative light.  Still a decent place to look at available jobs and apply quickly, but don’t use a resource for insight on any companies.</p>

      <p>Great for job searching. I just wish I could read reviews through the app instead of going to the website and signing in every time even though I’m signed in through the app. I guess that’s what the glassdoor app is for though. Oh well, I guess Indeed doesn’t want to be a one stop shop.  Also, resumes rarely transfer smoothly, making them almost useless.  And, the message function always zooms in way too far making it tough to read.  And if you need to accept or decline an offer, you can’t because the app won’t let you scroll down far enough.  

Like I said, good for seeing what’s out there, but that’s kind of where the utility of this app ends.  Once you see a job you want just call them.</p>

      <p>This app has become a joke! You can invest what’s probably a million dollars into hour long assessments but your app can’t even auto fill an application?lol I honestly don’t mind filling out my info but you expect me to set here and take an hour long assessment? 😂 Never going to happen! Do yourselves a favor and do like me, find the jobs that are hiring and apply directly through their company sites. Indeed has gotten waaaayyyy out of hand with these assessments. It won’t send your application until you finish THEIR assessments. So your expected to tie up an hour of your time for a job you may never hear from. Do better Indeed!</p>

On top of that, I’ve hit a “maximum” number of companies excluded. Then they’ve decided to add their own library of quizzes and halt the application process until you complete them. This would be fine if their tests were not 4 YEARS out of date in some cases.

It’s misleading and these contractors have more Requirements then the original job/company itself. Doesn’t really make sense.  Leave the other gig based platforms for that and only allow vetted Companies to post on indeed… please. It’s so hard to get in touch with the actual people now. 

Thank you.</p>

      <p>Job hunting is incredibly stressful, and in a lot of ways Indeed helps alleviate some of that stress with how convenient they make the application process. However that stress is often replaced with frustration. It doesn’t seem to matter how much I personalize my profile, how much information I give them, how specific I get in my search specifications. 90% of the jobs I see when searching are well outside my qualifications. I’m constantly sifting through jobs that require degrees and licenses I don’t have, located in areas I’m not anywhere near, hours that I can’t work, and for positions that I have no experience in or interest in trying.

It makes the whole process feel so much harder to look at a job that interests me only to realize I can’t apply to it.</p>

      <h4>Developers and employers need to read this, 2 stars (thernal_, Apple App Store, 2024-07-31)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Indeed for a while now, and I have to say, the experience has been incredibly frustrating. It often feels like companies post job openings just to make it look like they're hiring. I've applied to over 100 jobs, and barely any of them have even bothered to respond. The few that did just sent generic rejections, saying they were moving forward with other candidates.

The whole application process needs a serious overhaul. If jobs really need to be filled, why aren’t these companies hiring when people like me are applying? Job listings are often misleading, and many positions stay posted long after they've been filled. It’s disheartening to put in so much effort only to face automated rejections with no feedback on how to improve.

Indeed needs to push for more transparency and clearer communication from employers. It would also help if they ensured that job postings are up-to-date and accurate. The current system just isn’t working for job seekers, and it’s incredibly disheartening.</p>

      <p>1. I would like to be able to filter out certain industries or skills in my profile so they do not appear in my searches. I have no medical background or IT, but get listings for nurses, dentists, IT professionals, etc. There is an option to "Hide jobs with these details" but it does not work: I selected hiding "Spanish" but jobs requiring the language still appear. Being able to add your own items to the exclude list would be helpful as well. 
2. In addition, you can indicate you are not interested in a job 🚫 and select the reason, but similar jobs keep popping up. Why can't you completely exclude a field??? 
3. It would be good if a job were automatically moved to "applied" once you complete the application. I have come close to applying for the same job twice.
And finally a suggestion - it would be super helpful if listings fposted the location of the actual job - just the zip code would be extremely helpful! In some cases a position is posted through a recruiter and I'm not sure if the location is the recruoting office or the workplace. In others the nearest major city is listed but it is not where the person will be working - I've applied to some great sounding positions, only to find out the office location is not in my search radius. It's extremely frustrating!</p>

      <p>A lot of ghost job postings. Jobs that have no intention of hiring just collecting data. On top of that I now get contacted every day from scammers that claim to offer high paying remote jobs. But no actual job description just that they want your personal information. They get my email and number from indeed which means anyone can pose as an employer unchecked. Indeed needs to regulate these things.</p>

      <p>So like I’m OK with this app because it’s probably one of the easier ones to use and doesn’t direct you to other links like glass door does. However, I would just like indeed to understand that I don’t want to see the same job I applied for yesterday because I may have applied for 16 jobs. I don’t always remember then you click the link and then it says applied. OK that’s great but… can’t your algorithm just remove that job and put it in a separate column of already done jobs. I just think it needs a little bit of a redesign. And some jobs on there as well. You click the link to apply. It should easily apply or apply on website because I’m not gonna apply for a job that makes me send in my résumé, upload all the content on their website, when they should just look at the résumé I sent it just doesn’t make any sense nowadays what they make you do.</p>

      <h4>Fix search results?, 3 stars (pringles_sprite, Apple App Store, 2024-07-26)</h4>
      <p>Indeed has helped me a lot with finding jobs but it can also be really annoying. So I’m 18 and have only graduated high school, not college or anything, and I look for jobs that don’t require school experience, and I’ll get things like “Licensed nurse” or “Chef, needs 4+ years of schooling” 

It’s pretty frustrating especially when that’s the only thing that I get with my searches. I can also put in that I want work close to me, and it’ll show jobs that are pretty far away. Or I’ll search up something specific, like fast food, and it still gives me licensed travel nurse jobs???? I swear I’ve seen at least 500 licensed nurse jobs. I once scrolled through an entire page that was JUST nursing jobs which all said “your profile is missing some qualifications” duh? Why show it to me then?</p>

      <p>In my opinion indeed is a horrible app to try to look for a job on, non of the information goes to the employer instead they sell your information to scam caller. Out of the 145 job I applied for on indeed I can say that only 10 of those jobs have gotten back in contact with me , and only 4 out of those 10 gave me a opportunity for a interview. I can’t put all the blame on indeed because here in Jacksonville FL a lot of the companies put up false advertising saying that they are urgently hiring but as soon as you try to apply for that job either no one picks up the phone or they always direct you to call the next day to no response. I wouldn’t recommend this app towards anyone</p>

“ Thank you for taking the time to go through our appeal process. We review all accounts to ensure our employers and job seekers have the best experience.
 

We have reviewed your account, and we will not be lifting your suspension. Your profile will remain “Not Searchable” on Indeed, and employers will no longer be able to find it in search results. This also means that you are unable to apply to jobs or message employers using your Indeed account at this time.

 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Further appeals for this suspension will not be considered or responded to.

 

Thank you,

No reasoning and no recourse for resolution. Be careful with what info you share because after this, I have deep concerns and will be removing my account. I suggest you try another method or app</p>

I would’ve gave this app zero stars. This app gives u so many options to apply yet no companies will contact you back. No matter how much you applied to, they will not contact u. I suggest on going to the companies website to apply or walk in places to ask the manager for an opportunity to work.</p>

Often when I apply directly on the companys website after seeing their posting on indeed I will get a response.

For instance, uploading a cover letter file is nearly impossible. I find that I have to type in the cover letter in the indeed message box since it doesn’t allow me to upload the file. Also, after I hit submit application, it only spends in a circle as if it’s loading. It does not give actual confirmation that the application has been sent, and only continues to load for forever. Another issue I’m coming across. Is that when I’m browsing for jobs it doesn’t actually allow me to click on the jobs. I have to go through the browser to click on them and read about the company.</p>

      <h4>The worst job search app, 1 stars (LambOfGod160, Apple App Store, 2024-07-03)</h4>
      <p>I have been trying to use this app periodically for many years. I have a good work history and education but it seems none of that helps on indeed. Recently I have been looking for new opportunities and I have applied over and over and over to companies I am qualified to work for and 90% of those companies have not even viewed my application, the other 10% instantly rejected me which is strange considering they didn’t even have enough time to possibly review my resume before I got the email within seconds of applying. So I tried a different app and suddenly I’m getting phone calls from companies that never responded on indeed. Also there are many times when you hit apply on indeed and it does nothing and stays on the same page so you have to refresh it or close the app and try again, and that persists even after ensuring the app is up to date. The filters for mileage radius don’t work either. There are more suggestions for jobs you aren’t qualified for than anything and even if you update your preferences to exclude them, the continue to show in your results. I’ve seen a lot of reputable employers seem to no longer use this app for candidates as well so the work is moving elsewhere on other apps. Indeed is only good if you are either in healthcare or have very specific licenses and experience in intensive labor positions, like digging ditches for new electrical lines or something. It’s a very weird app with no reputable employers and filters that don’t work. 0/5 stars.</p>
