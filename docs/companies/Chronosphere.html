        <h2>Positive Sentiment about Chronosphere</h2>

<li>"Chronosphere doesn’t charge for agents or per seat for licensing - they give you the tools to identify the utilization of your data allow you to aggregate the waste and only charge you on what you choose to persist." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/1f4wori/looking_for_some_guidance_for_an_observability/lkqfqab/">(Affectionate_Top_870, Reddit, 2024-08-30)</a></li>
