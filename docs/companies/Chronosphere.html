        <h1>About Chronosphere</h1>
<p>Chronosphere is a cloud-native observability platform founded in 2019 and headquartered in Issaquah, Washington. The company specializes in helping organizations manage and optimize their observability data, which is essential for real-time monitoring of application and infrastructure performance. Chronosphere operates in the B2B space, targeting businesses that require advanced observability solutions to manage complex cloud-native environments. The company has raised a total of $369 million in funding across five rounds, with a valuation of $1.6 billion following its Series C funding round led by Google Ventures <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/chronosphere/__-A10RU2_rCsBWguxz36B8uFkqiTWEehYrdzwWHN5UEU">(Tracxn, 2021)</a>.</p>
<p>Chronosphere's platform is designed to provide tools for monitoring, analyzing, and controlling data, with a focus on cost management and performance optimization. It integrates with popular open-source tools like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, facilitating a smooth transition from legacy systems. The platform's unique pricing model is based on the useful data retained, rather than traditional metrics like hosts or VMs, which can help organizations manage costs more effectively <a href="https://chronosphere.io/">(Chronosphere, 2023)</a>.</p>
