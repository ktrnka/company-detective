        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Companies like Chronosphere allow for granular controls on what is getting ingressed, what is getting stored as well looking at overall usage to understand patterns to optimize." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/15b1057/datadog_costs_that_high/jtvm5b1/">(creatiwit1, Reddit, 2023-07-29)</a></li>

<h3>Product Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The control plane is my fave part - such a gamechanger it <em>almost</em> made me reconsider my retirement from SRE (almost)" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sre/comments/1934g6b/managing_rising_data_ingestion_in_datadog/khec7eq/">(paigerduty, Reddit, 2024-01-11)</a></li>

<h3>Competitive Advantage</h3>
<ul>
<li>"If you’re considering newer players like HC, might want to check out Chronosphere as well if you haven’t already.
