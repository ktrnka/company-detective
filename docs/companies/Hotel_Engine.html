</ul>
<h3>App Functionality Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Help/chat links do not work. Reports hotel as full on rooms, at hotel needed to add another week but says full. Hotel staff said they are not full at all. Seems to be traffic steering." <a href="https://google_play/b28c5cb6-541b-4466-93f8-46d4ab2b4462">(ARIES0358, Google Play Store, 2024-03-07)</a></li>

<li>"The app crashes frequently when trying to book, screen freezes, I get double booked frequently because the screen is frozen." <a href="https://apple/4687690650">(Spellboy, Apple App Store, 2019-08-28)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Pricing and Fees Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Yes you may save a few bucks but your account is debited immediately. In addition you need to be vigilant as to not being double charged by the hotel." <a href="https://apple/1538238290">(Tremors910, Apple App Store, 2017-02-05)</a></li>
<li>"Hotel Engine pricing vs other hotel apps, the discounts are always about 5% less than others." <a href="https://google_play/86e31ac9-3fc2-4a68-a715-3fdef7924568">(Jon Cordoba, Google Play Store, 2022-09-02)</a></li>
<li>"Hotel Engines claims that they do not charge fees to users. What they do is inflate the 'taxes and fees' above and beyond any actual taxes or fees charged by the hotel and pocket the difference." <a href="https://apple/11630842640">(JonathanSapan, Apple App Store, 2024-08-20)</a></li>
<li>"There are some good deals out there. You have to be careful I booked a hotel room at the Hyde Hotel in Hollywood Florida room cost was $148 plus taxes and fees that came to $302 for one night stay." <a href="https://apple/11095929482">(Skeptical, traveler, Apple App Store, 2024-03-28)</a></li>
<li>"Hotel Engine does not do price match. For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99." <a href="https://apple/6538819685">(wingchunfan, Apple App Store, 2020-10-15)</a></li>

<li>"Really bad user experience. Here is what I have to go thru every time, I do a fresh search! Open the app, enter info to find a property, select a property, app requires you to login but lost all my previous search results." <a href="https://apple/9081963518">(SearchItAll, Apple App Store, 2022-09-13)</a></li>
<li>"The app itself works great and is very informative. That being said, the hotel options offered are very low class, with most sites being rated as poor and terrible." <a href="https://google_play/32f96898-3e34-4c28-9a2d-0044457792f4">(Matt Harwood, Google Play Store, 2025-03-12)</a></li>

      <p>Horrible customer service. I've called three times to get an issue with a hotel not accepting my credit card and still being charged for the room. Three different customer service agents told me they would call me back and haven't. It's wonderful when you show up to a hotel, told you can't check in because they don't accept my credit card. I even paid for the Flex to cover for me and they haven't honored it, even when I called the night of the incident. Horrible customer service!</p>

      <p>Slow & buggy. Every button seems to usually need to be pressed twice if you haven't touched the screen in a second. When a text field appears with a blinking cursor, your keyboard doesn't open. So, another touch to make the app actual useful. This app is worse & keeps getting worse. It's so slow that I'm going back to using the website version. 2 updates since... same problems still.</p>

      <p>Slow, crashes, and resets itself if you switch apps (meaning you come back to the app you were looking at something on & it is back at the starting screen) Being able to set your price & other filters before searching would help cut down on a lot of the lag. But I imagine then the ad buying hotels would get upset. Customers be damned, ad money first! ☹️ Needs optimization & polish. The website version almost works better than the app.</p>

The higher priced rate rooms i selected (lower on list of those offered) were not coded correctly and have incorrect information (ie, this rate includes breakfast or this room has x beds). Hotel can't do anything to fix, you uave to work through he to fix. Takes about 40 minutes per mistake. This is really unacceptable.</p>

      <p>I notice they give you a discount but add extra cost on the "taxes and fees" which more than likely bring the price back to a standard price you would find else where or even directly through the hotel itself. I literally have to cross-check each final price, and i usually find better prices somewhere else. PAY ATTENTION!!! Sometimes you hit and more times you miss !</p>

Honestly, the points are worth $10 extra dollars, considering with some organizations, you'll earn up to 5k points a night and a point is equal to about $0.16, per IHG</p>

      <p>We are stuck in this area due to our vehicle breaking down, try to add a night and for some reason can't get a confirmation, went ahead and booked another different hotel and still don't have a confirmation after a couple hours, wondering what is going on. No way to filter out smoking rooms, and sometimes that's the only rooms that come up.</p>

      <p>Hotel Engine pricing vs other hotel apps, the discounts are always about 5% less than others. However realize that Hotel Engine shops other third party booking sites pricing and actually books through those third party sites. Arriving at the hotel you can ask who the booking is through, I've had Orbitz, travelocity and a couple others. The downside to this is flexibility. If you need to cancel or modify a reservation it's very difficult. I'm going back to Hotels com as my 1st booking choice.</p>

      <p>Since I've started using Hotel Engine I've stayed in nicer hotels within our company budget. When you stay approx 18-24 nights a month in hotels every extra nice amenity makes a world of difference. This is the best app for hotels I've found. I turned my friends and Co workers onto Hotel Engine and they love it just like I do. I've only had one booking that was a Hassel and they quickly corrected the problem. Staff is proffesional sweet and very helpful.</p>

      <p>Avoid Engine and save yourself time and money by doing so. I can not even get the login on the app to work to review my account. I have been quoted figured that were “negotiated” then took 6 weeks to have paperwork on, all of which was wrong/more expensive. No one owns up to their work nor timely in their response, unless them getting paid is concerned and then they will not stop calling even when you’re very clear on when you’re available and intent on your request. Being in sales, contract negotiations specifically, I hoped someone could take over that burden and let me be a bride. Not Engine. They aren’t even honest - they sent me a “we got it!” response when the agreement was in hand, but intentionally left out all the differences from the original agreement so I’d sign and hopefully never catch all the errors. Really bad business practices and very dishonest.</p>

Even though I was within the policy’s rules. I booked a hotel the had okay rating to find out I was put in a room with BED BUGS and I am told I am getting only half of my money back in travel credits whenever I asked for a full refund to my card.

      <h4>Higher prices than booking direct, no price match, 2 stars (wingchunfan, Apple App Store, 2020-10-15)</h4>
      <p>Hotel Engine does not do price match. For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. 
Hotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.</p>

      <p>Being a territory sales manager I tend to travel quite a bit and book many stays at hotels.  I have used many apps out there for booking as well as booking direct.  I found Hotel Engine a couple years ago and used their service every now and then.  They have pretty good deals and are competitive with the other companies out there in terms of pricing but was not my first choice cause I like to get points for my stays.  I try to book only Hilton family hotels so I can accumulate points and earn some free nights for vacations with the fam.  

To my surprise, Hotel Engine now allows you to use your loyalty number while booking!!! 

For real this is a total game changer for me! Also they upgraded their mobile app and is now a million times better than the old one!! It seems Hotel Engine has listened to their users and delivered which can be pretty rare these days when dealing with these bigger companies!!! I don’t need to jump around anymore and download a bunch of booking apps as this is now my first choice!  Keep up the good work Hotel Engine!!! Glad to see you in full Phoenix form!!!</p>

      <p>There are some good deals out there. You have to be careful I booked a hotel room at the Hyde Hotel in Hollywood Florida room cost was $148 plus taxes and fees that came to $302 for one night stay then when I checked out I got hit with another set of resort charges taxes and fees by the hotel. Tried to go through Hotel Engine with no avail. So what should it cost me $300 to stay the night at this property ended up costing me $585 that’s why I say be careful careful especially at properties that charge resort fees because they are not in the price of Hotel Engine and they don’t let you know that.</p>

      <p>This app is great. Reservations are quick and easy. Only advise I have is read about section of any hotel you like and look at parking there have become more and more money hungry hotel that charge $10 or more per day to park in their parking lot. Since buried in description most don’t see and hotel don’t say anything but will charge you with card on file in middle of night and slide receipt under door read parking section closely they will get you if not.</p>

      <h4>Some good, some big negatives, 4 stars (notthrilledHE, Apple App Store, 2019-11-25)</h4>
      <p>I spend over 100 nights a year in hotels for work.  My company just switched to Hotel Engine and my review is a mix of good and bad.  

Good- the app is pretty easy to navigate and the selection of rooms is good. They have (sort of) a rewards program that can be used for rooms.  Prices are decent but not great

Bad - Hotel Engine uses Priceline as their booking engine.  That means decent rates but no hotel rewards at all. That means everyone in my company loses their elite hotel status which gives us all sorts of perks (no upgraded rooms, no upgraded internet, no free meals, the list goes on). 

In summary, I’m begging my company to move away from this system after using them for less than a month.  Saving $4/night isn’t worth the added expenses several hundred employees will incur</p>
