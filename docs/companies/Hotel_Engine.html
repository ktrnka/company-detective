      <p>What can I say - I'll never pay more for a hotel ever again! No more price shopping, and Hotel Engine helps me not have to do that and the more I use it the more I trust it! For work sometimes I need to turn in receipts and I get instant access to them! This makes life easy and I also get to keep my loyalty reward numbers with my favorite hotels all in one place.</p>

      <p>I had two out of three bookings with wrong rooms and features on last trip. The higher priced rate rooms i selected (lower on list of those offered) were not coded correctly and have incorrect information (ie, this rate includes breakfast or this room has x beds). Hotel can't do anything to fix, you uave to work through he to fix. Takes about 40 minutes per mistake. This is really unacceptable.</p>

      <p>Absolutely horrible. My employer is considering switching from CLC to this platform and it is garbage. The only brands it gives me are Super 8, Motel 6, Travelodge and similar dumps, including a $31 motel. Through CLC I can get Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Express in the same area. The only positive is you can get brand loyalty rewards if you use this app.</p>

      <p>I notice they give you a discount but add extra cost on the "taxes and fees" which more than likely bring the price back to a standard price you would find else where or even directly through the hotel itself. I literally have to cross-check each final price, and i usually find better prices somewhere else. PAY ATTENTION!!! Sometimes you hit and more times you miss !</p>

      <p>It gives the best prices, but you sacrifice the points you would have earned with respective organizations (IHG, Hilton, etc.) Mainly in part due to them not being registered accordingly. Honestly, the points are worth $10 extra dollars, considering with some organizations, you'll earn up to 5k points a night and a point is equal to about $0.16, per IHG</p>

However realize that Hotel Engine shops other third party booking sites pricing and actually books through those third party sites. Arriving at the hotel you can ask who the booking is through, I've had Orbitz, travelocity and a couple others. The downside to this is flexibility. If you need to cancel or modify a reservation it's very difficult. I'm going back to Hotels com as my 1st booking choice.</p>

      <p>Since I've started using Hotel Engine I've stayed in nicer hotels within our company budget. When you stay approx 18-24 nights a month in hotels every extra nice amenity makes a world of difference. This is the best app for hotels I've found. I turned my friends and Co workers onto Hotel Engine and they love it just like I do. I've only had one booking that was a Hassel and they quickly corrected the problem. Staff is proffesional sweet and very helpful.</p>

      <p>It's a good app in progress. It gets you a discount as promised, but not any better than some other apps. I often check my other apps too and sometimes use this one, and sometimes use the others depending on the discount. It would be nice to just know the discount is going to be the best available. The ability to get clean receipts without advertising or unless comments is lacking also. A must for accounting purposes. It currently defaults to 2 guests. That should be an adjustable option.</p>

For the past 2 weeks, after watching for an area in the app, I find myself staring at a blank white screen as others have written about. Fortunately, I can still log into the website and book a room. It was better when I first started using the app. Not pulling up results literally means the app is unusable</p>

      <p>Hotel Engines claims that they do not charge fees to users.  What they do is inflate the "taxes and fees" above and beyond any actual taxes or fees charged by the hotel and pocket the difference.</p>

      <h4>Be careful!, 1 stars (Skeptical, traveler, Apple App Store, 2024-03-28)</h4>
      <p>There are some good deals out there. You have to be careful I booked a hotel room at the Hyde Hotel in Hollywood Florida room cost was $148 plus taxes and fees that came to $302 for one night stay then when I checked out I got hit with another set of resort charges taxes and fees by the hotel. Tried to go through Hotel Engine with no avail. So what should it cost me $300 to stay the night at this property ended up costing me $585 that’s why I say be careful careful especially at properties that charge resort fees because they are not in the price of Hotel Engine and they don’t let you know that.</p>

They don’t listen to your preferences on the phone and don’t even reward the refund! I have been put on hold for 30+ mins before or told “we will call you back” when in reality after 2+ hours you will have to call them back just to be told they couldn’t do anything for you. It took a WHOLE DAY to discuss if I could get a refund for a hotel that I canceled in the allotted amount of time on the app but them telling me I couldn’t?! Even though I was within the policy’s rules. I booked a hotel the had okay rating to find out I was put in a room with BED BUGS and I am told I am getting only half of my money back in travel credits whenever I asked for a full refund to my card. They disregard your preferences and try to just scam you out of money. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AT ALL!!! They only want to screw you over!</p>

Since buried in description most don’t see and hotel don’t say anything but will charge you with card on file in middle of night and slide receipt under door read parking section closely they will get you if not.</p>

      <p>After talking to the sales person at HE, I signed up for an upcoming trip. I did not know this, but as soon as I booked the rooms, they billed me. After a couple of weeks, the trip plan changed by one day so called customer service to cancel one day on both rooms. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, they moved one room and hotel canceled the other due to a “no show” and hotel engine’s cc didn’t work. We called customer service again and they said they’d call right back. No fun sitting in hotel lobby for three hours and several attempts to contact HE was a dismal failure. I then called and got two rooms at a different hotel and I’m still waiting for the refund from the original hotel.</p>

      <h4>Higher prices than booking direct, no price match, 2 stars (wingchunfan, Apple App Store, 2020-10-15)</h4>
      <p>Hotel Engine does not do price match. For example, I’ve found Staybridge hotel from IHG website for $95 and $90 for government rate. HE charges the same hotel at $99. They’re in the business of reselling at higher markup. Small pocket change but multiplied by thousands of transaction per day equal substantial profit margin. 
Hotel Engine is a mediocre platform for hotel reservation. State of TX has a multi-year contract with Hotel Engine (HE) which makes no sense since it is a new player without a proven record. It’s better for State of TX employees to book direct with hotel because at least it gives them more choices. HE search result is very dishonest and misleading. On the mobile app, there is no way to filter out room that is not available on the search result so you end up wasting time clicking through each hotel to find it has room available. Prices are often higher than direct booking. I would not recommend this app to anyone unless you don’t have any other option.</p>

      <p>Being a territory sales manager I tend to travel quite a bit and book many stays at hotels.  I have used many apps out there for booking as well as booking direct.  I found Hotel Engine a couple years ago and used their service every now and then.  They have pretty good deals and are competitive with the other companies out there in terms of pricing but was not my first choice cause I like to get points for my stays.  I try to book only Hilton family hotels so I can accumulate points and earn some free nights for vacations with the fam.  

To my surprise, Hotel Engine now allows you to use your loyalty number while booking!!! 

For real this is a total game changer for me! Also they upgraded their mobile app and is now a million times better than the old one!! It seems Hotel Engine has listened to their users and delivered which can be pretty rare these days when dealing with these bigger companies!!! I don’t need to jump around anymore and download a bunch of booking apps as this is now my first choice!  Keep up the good work Hotel Engine!!! Glad to see you in full Phoenix form!!!</p>

      <h4>Some good, some big negatives, 4 stars (notthrilledHE, Apple App Store, 2019-11-25)</h4>
      <p>I spend over 100 nights a year in hotels for work.  My company just switched to Hotel Engine and my review is a mix of good and bad.  

Good- the app is pretty easy to navigate and the selection of rooms is good. They have (sort of) a rewards program that can be used for rooms.  Prices are decent but not great

Bad - Hotel Engine uses Priceline as their booking engine.  That means decent rates but no hotel rewards at all. That means everyone in my company loses their elite hotel status which gives us all sorts of perks (no upgraded rooms, no upgraded internet, no free meals, the list goes on). 

In summary, I’m begging my company to move away from this system after using them for less than a month.  Saving $4/night isn’t worth the added expenses several hundred employees will incur</p>
