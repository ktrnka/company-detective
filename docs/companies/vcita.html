I am paying €15/pm on a very basic booking plan but I can't log monthly memberships etc on the system as I was advised it would take a lot of time to set up. I have 3 payments options...unlimited membership, membership for seniors and class causal. I didn't think it would be hard to set up? The staff have been really helpful and friendly.. No app though.</p>

      <p>As a consultant / entrepreneur, single mom, and full-time employee I am always working.  There is not a lot of time for administrative work and that is why I love vCITA. I send all of my potential clients there for free consultations which allows them to create their client profile for me. The scheduler is connected to my personal calendar which allows me to work when / how I want to and live, too! I've been a customer for over two years and I will not leave. There are bells and whistles I still haven't tapped into and the customer service is great. I've only needed help with customer service once and it was resolved quickly.  The app is easy to manage, customize, and integrate with social media and my payment system. I absolutely love the appointment reminders my clients receive and how easy it is for them to reschedule. vCITA solves a huge administrative problem for me and keeps me sane as I juggle all of my roles and workload while providing excellent care to my clients.</p>

In that five years, we have had non-stop issues including Vcita losing 2 entire years or over 20,000 patient records. How does a HIPPA software lose two full year of all patient records. They then asked if we could have someone rescan and label all 20,000 records? Seriously. Vcita is incredibly buggy with most features seldom working. If there is any positive, it customer support will usually respond, after 1-2 weeks, so do not ever expect any support. I would avoid.</p>

      <p>I have been one of the earliest adopter of Vcita since 2014 and everything seemed promising. With time the company grew up, problems with security and privacy arose, customer support quality declined and pricing has skyrocketed. 
As a business owner my delivery on promises made to customers are #1 priority. I have been loyal client for 10 years now and all I get is price increase every year and total silence when report issues.
 The mobile app is glitchy and has poor performance, the web portal has many log in issues as well across devices.
 I am using the basics as Mini CRM but considering finding another solution. Just wish there was an accountability and fulfillment of clients promises made. This is not the way to go VCITA!</p>

All of my important docs are stored in my CRM. I can send estimates with E-sign feature through my CRM. All clients get receipts for all of their payments through my CRM. My clients contact me through my CRM, so no more texting, FB messenger and iG DMs. I can even market to all my clients with the Marketing feature. This CRM will literally do everything that you need it to do. 

And btw they offer partnership opportunities where if you have a business like I do (marketing agency) you can white-label the software and resell it to your own clients!</p>

      <h4>A must have tool for small businesses!, 5 stars (SteveM11209, Apple App Store, 2020-10-13)</h4>
      <p>To grow a small business you have to have time to work on the business instead of in it, vCita makes it much easier to handle daily tasks so you can focus on growing your business. I know, because I have built a few businesses from the ground up and vCita has been my go to tool for a long time. 

Is it perfect, no, but from experience I can say that no tool is. What makes this product shine is the ease of use, for you the owner and for clients. It’s also extremely flexible with the ability to customize everything. With a little help from a seasoned pro, this tool can do anything from scheduling, reminders, payments and my favorite is the ability to integrate with Zapier - that’s when the real fun starts since you can share information between vCita and apps like QuickBooks, ship-station and so on. Ohh, the client portal is a sweet new bonus feature! 

vCita is well worth the expense, in my professional opinion. 

Thank you.

It’s almost useless unless you do it on a computer. The invoices cannot take deposits or partial payments which means you cannot use the converted estimate as an invoice if you accept a partial payment. Then you have to create a new invoice. Customer service (live) isn’t all that easy to reach either. The client  ecard is great and the ability to create tags and categories is nice. The rest just needs work.

      <p>Now I understand why they charge you for a whole year in advance. They have the worst customer service ever. You will be calling for a whole day without answer, even if you leave messages, emails, more messages at the website... nothing works. When you mention that you want your money back, everybody disappears... 👎🏼</p>

      <h4>Needs iPad Update, 1 stars (JNHohol, Apple App Store, 2017-10-29)</h4>
      <p>This was a great app to use on my iPad with my smart keyboard to send out my responses but after iOS 11 came out, the app no longer works. It still works on my iPhone but typing out long responses doesn’t really make sense unless I am away from my computer or iPad. Even the website doesn’t work in safari or google chrome on the iPad. Hopefully they fix this and I can start using my iPad again. I’ll update my rating once they fix this serious issue.</p>

      <h4>HATE this app, 2 stars (Movie-lover42, Apple App Store, 2016-08-03)</h4>
      <p>While I love the service on my desk top and through Safari, I hate the app. It requires me to enter my email and password every time I just need to quickly check something, and I find that very inconvenient. I can see asking for my password if I want to make changes or set appointments, but just to look at my calendar or check if a customer has paid there is no reason for the time and effort needed to get into the app. Also, when I just try to save the website to my screen, it loads the app again even if I have deleted it. I want more control. I may switch services just for this reason alone.</p>

      <p>Quite frankly, I’m amazed at how well vCita's best web features have translated to the mobile app! Already a standout program with the LiveSite Widget, notes search capability, as well as the client portal and communication features, the new app simply propels vCita way out ahead of its competitors. Additionally, during my transition to the new app, all of my feedback has been responded to quickly and any kinks ironed out thoroughly. This is CRM + Scheduling at it’s best! As long as they keep this up, I’m with vCita for the long haul.</p>

And now that they have a zapier API connection the system now closed the loop! I can get leads into my Crm automatically.  I would hate to delete Vcita from my phone and especially from my website!</p>
