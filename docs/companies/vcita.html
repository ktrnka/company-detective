      <p>I'm not sure. I signed up so my clients could book their fitness classes but unfortunately t I have had to create 'events'. I am paying €15/pm on a very basic booking plan but I can't log monthly memberships etc on the system as I was advised it would take a lot of time to set up. I have 3 payments options...unlimited membership, membership for seniors and class causal. I didn't think it would be hard to set up? The staff have been really helpful and friendly.. No app though.</p>

      <p>I don't know what is causing the new set delayed launch since the last update. It takes up to 2-5 minutes to launch or never launches after "checking for updates". Useless when you are trying to check your calendar for upcoming appointments. Please fix. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it, restarted my phone and still the same behavior.</p>

      <p>As a consultant / entrepreneur, single mom, and full-time employee I am always working.  There is not a lot of time for administrative work and that is why I love vCITA. I send all of my potential clients there for free consultations which allows them to create their client profile for me. The scheduler is connected to my personal calendar which allows me to work when / how I want to and live, too! I've been a customer for over two years and I will not leave. There are bells and whistles I still haven't tapped into and the customer service is great. I've only needed help with customer service once and it was resolved quickly.  The app is easy to manage, customize, and integrate with social media and my payment system. I absolutely love the appointment reminders my clients receive and how easy it is for them to reschedule. vCITA solves a huge administrative problem for me and keeps me sane as I juggle all of my roles and workload while providing excellent care to my clients.</p>

      <p>This could've been a great app. But it's missing a couple of essential features:  1) It would be useful if it came with a widget, so I could view my clients, appointments, etc. at a glance.  2) It really needs to be able to sync the calendar with Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar, from within the app.</p>

      <p>This has literally been a life changer. It takes all the work out of scheduling appointments and communication with customers. I no longer am trying to get back to people at 9 at night after working in the field all day. I could go on and on. Amazing. If you own a small business this is a must</p>

      <p>My husband owns a carpet cleaning company and we use vcita for scheduling appointments. I am so glad there is finally an app to use for contacting customers on the go! More revisions will make this an amazing app!</p>
