            <h1>Customer experience</h1>
            <h2>COMPANY Monte Carlo</h2>
<h3>General Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Monte Carlo methods are trivial to parallelize: just run N copies of the same program and collate the output afterwards." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/goehu2i/">(agate_, Reddit, 2021-02-23)</a></li>
<li>"Unless you run these simulations 24x7 or a substantial fraction thereof, you may be better off using cloud, because for the same budget you can probably throw way more hardware at the problem." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/goe5u78/">(antonivs, Reddit, 2021-02-22)</a></li>
<li>"If your goal is literally something like, 'buy some hardware because we have budget and want a shiny box to point to,' then knock yourself out and buy the shiniest looking box you can afford." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/lprxap/computer_rec_for_monte_carlo_simulations/goe7xm4/">(antonivs, Reddit, 2021-02-22)</a></li>

<li>"It's actually pretty good!! It can OHKO most orange bar enemies and if you have enough stacks of the buff, you can chain stab enemies." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4sm2ns/">(JOWhite63087, Reddit, 2024-05-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Monte Carlo is quite a slow grower submersed without CO2 so it’ll take a very long time for the carpet to grow in fully." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/w90b8p/help_will_my_monte_carlo_grow_in_if_planted_like/ihtntmg/">(Sedgehammer12, Reddit, 2022-07-27)</a></li>

<li>"Monte Carlo isn't really a non-C02 friendly type plant. Monte Carlo, like all plants, needs light and carbon dioxide to grow." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/146794q/monte_carlo_starting_to_die_no_co2_3_weeks_old/jnotgfj/">(kluv76, Reddit, 2023-06-10)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Mixed Reviews</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have a montecarlo carpet that took a year to look decent in, no co2." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/146794q/monte_carlo_starting_to_die_no_co2_3_weeks_old/jnpuqap/">(Intelligent_Soup_197, Reddit, 2023-06-10)</a></li>
<li>"I tried a dry start. Had minimal to moderate success after three months. Flooded the tank and added co2 and it shot up and spread out like crazy." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquascape/comments/pkt2md/drystart_monte_carlo_not_growing_very_well/hc88ryf/">(FromundaMyballz, Reddit, 2021-09-09)</a></li>
<li>"Monte Carlo has one less zoom than any other AR. That means you need to play at closer range, but also that it's better for dueling." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/gmmj3e/monte_carlo_vs_suros_regime/fr4ohc1/">(Sarniarama, Reddit, 2020-05-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Monte Carlo is a garbage catalyst that doesn't flow with the gameplay at all. It needs a major rework." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l7y3inx/">(AdConstant6746, Reddit, 2024-06-10)</a></li>
<li>"What you are experiencing is mostly likely 'melting' when plants transition to a new environment." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquascape/comments/pkt2md/drystart_monte_carlo_not_growing_very_well/hc5ywtx/">(Tough_Branch4062, Reddit, 2021-09-09)</a></li>
<li>"The Monte carlo you have looks like it has been grown emersed (out of water). Plants need time to transition to aquatic growth." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/146794q/monte_carlo_starting_to_die_no_co2_3_weeks_old/jnrz7o9/">(inebriated_balrog, Reddit, 2023-06-11)</a></li>
<li>"It's a meme but good in low to mid level content." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cvz4rl/just_got_the_monte_carlo_catalyst_looks_like_fun/l4t3fak/">(sithlord40000, Reddit, 2024-05-20)</a></li>
