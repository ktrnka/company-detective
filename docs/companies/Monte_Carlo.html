        <h2>Sentiment: Positive Feedback on Monte Carlo</h2>
<h3>General Usefulness</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I've used MC in financial modeling for years. Let’s say you can put together a spreadsheet for financial projections but you have several values that are not precisely known but can be parameterized with well known distributions." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5xa9c6/">(None, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>

I would use it when doing contract valuations for athletes or when predicting outcomes of sports games." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5yq53a/">(Aggravating_Sand352, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>
<li>"It's pretty useful in system analysis- monte carlo is fundamental to simulation modeling as a whole." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5yn58x/">(rdp777, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>
<li>"MC simulations are really useful in quant areas of finance. I frequently use them to come up with valuations of complex instruments like options and earnout payments." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j5zn3pt/">(EMoneymaker99, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>
<li>"The simplest reason to use Monte Carlo simulation is that you fit a model (e.g. logistic regression) and you want to calculate predictions for a range of values of one of the variables." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/10ljew2/monte_carlo_simulation/j6001fc/">(Coco_Dirichlet, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>

<li>"MC is not just 'doing shit until it works.' I still remember reading the original Metropolis Monte Carlo paper more than 30 years ago and being amazed at what you could do with statistical methods to sample a high-dimensionality space efficiently for the purpose of numerical integration." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1amy1gh/could_someone_explain_whats_so_interesting_about/kppfaid/">(Amadis001, Reddit, 2024-02-09)</a></li>
