        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Efficiency and Time-Saving</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I’ve been using Abridge for the past month and holy shit has it changed my practice. Filters out all the unnecessary stuff and writes my entire HPI and is usually great for an MDM as well (with practice). I never see a patient without it now." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l77y2pe/">(Drgibson335, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
<li>"I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use." <a href="https://apple/10481382241">(Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</a></li>
<li>"Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day." <a href="https://apple/11402406988">(Kahnfessions, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</a></li>
<li>"Being a family doc is fun again! Absolutely amazing product!" <a href="https://apple/11346364911">(Game Changer!!, Apple App Store, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of AI and Summarization</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"It does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relevant SOAP note." <a href="https://apple/10481382241">(Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</a></li>
<li>"It listens to the conversation and writes a transcription. The AI part of it then takes that transcription and writes a SOAP note summarizing the conversation." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1gcwj1i/anyone_using_ai_charting/lu1s5is/">(WaterMazer, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Impressive Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Abridge understands foreign languages and can make sense out of a non-English/english conversation since when I talk to patients in a language rather than English, we often use English words and terms, so the conversation often becomes a hodgepodge of words - and Abridge can make sense of it MOST of the time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus9081/">(durask11, Reddit, 2024-11-01)</a></li>
<li>"I am honest SUPER impressed with Abridge." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus9081/">(durask11, Reddit, 2024-11-01)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Integration and Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The only slight negative so far is the lack of integration into Epic. Basically it makes notes that will protect you in an audit assuming you spoke with the patient thoroughly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laqaz31/">(Respect-Immediate, Reddit, 2024-06-28)</a></li>
<li>"Apparently Epic will be loaded with something called Abridge for KP shortly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kuaa9iy/">(None, Reddit, 2024-03-10)</a></li>
<li>"Abridge integrates with epic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1i3zkte/best_ai_medical_scribe_out_there/m7riol5/">(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-18)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Curve and Adaptation</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I work in Compliance and I love the AI notes. My org uses Abridge and... it may take a bit of getting use to, like telling the patient your independent interpretation vs just documenting it, but overall it’s been a game changer for the Physicians I’ve talked with who use it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laqaz31/">(Respect-Immediate, Reddit, 2024-06-28)</a></li>
<li>"I found that it wasn’t saving me a ton of time, as I’d still have to go back and make fairly extensive edits." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l78kh23/">(None, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Issues and Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"There are rare hallucinations in the notes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&amp;P." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"I’ve been using Freed for a few months now and it was great at first but over time it has gotten to the point where it’s actually taking more time to edit the notes than if I had just done them from scratch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ksmwvq6/">(Aggravating_Shoe2523, Reddit, 2024-02-29)</a></li>
<li>"If they cut the price in half, I’d recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn’t say it’s worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"My wife uses DAX at work and I did not like it at all, I think it is far inferior to Abridge and also like other Nuance products it does not understand accents and produces gibberish." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1ggmdf8/thoughtsexperiences_working_with_ai_scribes/lus9081/">(durask11, Reddit, 2024-11-01)</a></li>

      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. I’ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
