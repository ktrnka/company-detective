<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>

      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>Iâ€™ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when Iâ€™m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. Iâ€™ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
