        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Efficiency and Time-Saving</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"The integration is a huge time saver. Not having to copy/paste saves a lot of time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"I’ve been using Abridge for the past month and holy shit has it changed my practice. Filters out all the unnecessary stuff and writes my entire HPI and is usually great for an MDM as well (with practice). I never see a patient without it now." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l77y2pe/">(Praxician94, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
<li>"Since I started using it about a month ago, I think it shaves about 20 minutes off my average clinic day." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1dumz82/what_aidriven_innovations_have_you_experienced/lblt36l/">(iFixDix, Reddit, 2024-07-04)</a></li>
<li>"I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use." <a href="https://apple/10481382241">(Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved Patient Engagement</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I am 100% able to be more engaged with patients, listening to them more carefully and make sure I don't miss details. Furthermore, it ensures the note is super accurate, it improves your own patient care by ensuring everything is documented--which makes it easier if a patient comes back to make sure we don't repeat things." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3g3dv5/">(PresidentSnow, Reddit, 2024-05-10)</a></li>
<li>"Being a family doc is fun again! Absolutely amazing product!" <a href="https://apple/11346364911">(Game Changer!!, Apple App Store, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Integration and Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The only slight negative so far is the lack of integration into Epic. Basically it makes notes that will protect you in an audit assuming you spoke with the patient thoroughly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laqaz31/">(Respect-Immediate, Reddit, 2024-06-28)</a></li>
<li>"Integration is key. Proof and edit is going to be needed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8cbx7u/">(No_Bed_9042, Reddit, 2024-06-12)</a></li>
<li>"Abridge is a mixed bag of docs who love it and docs who aren’t totally sold." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l78kh23/">(drtraumallama, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>"There are rare hallucinations in the notes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"I found that it wasn’t saving me a ton of time, as I’d still have to go back and make fairly extensive edits." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l78kh23/">(drtraumallama, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>
<li>"I thought so at first and now I find it irritating. Too much is not included or messed up. Takes me longer to correct on the back end rather than just typing in the room." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1dumz82/what_aidriven_innovations_have_you_experienced/lbjuglw/">(FerociouslyCeaseless, Reddit, 2024-07-04)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Limitations and Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The only issue has been needing to recap the visit at the end for a more accurate A&amp;P." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>
<li>"Their AI scribe itself is also inferior to others out there. Can't even pick gender in your patient notes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/">(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)</a></li>
<li>"AI has the potential to improve efficiency especially with documentation. But I don't think that will allow clinicians to reduce their workload and improve outcomes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1dumz82/what_aidriven_innovations_have_you_experienced/lbjeptx/">(hippoberserk, Reddit, 2024-07-04)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It’s passed all of our legal and security checks but there is increased scrutiny from the Privacy Officer." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1dqjimn/when_will_ai_write_our_notes/laqaz31/">(Respect-Immediate, Reddit, 2024-06-28)</a></li>
<li>"The fact that your organization is making up some BS excuse of 'don't get your own because of reasons' just solidifies my theory that Abridge is doing something shady to get more market share." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k704nnq/">(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>General Observations</h2>
<h3>Market Position</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Apparently Epic will be loaded with something called Abridge for KP shortly" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/kuaa9iy/">(Nerdypleasebenice, Reddit, 2024-03-10)</a></li>
<li>"Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot, for example, can capture audio during an appointment and then write up notes for the doctor to review." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/">(thisisbillgates, Reddit, 2023-11-10)</a></li>
<li>"Helping patients and healthcare workers will be especially beneficial for people in poor countries, where many never get to see a doctor at all." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17rrd6h/ai_is_about_to_completely_change_how_you_use/">(thisisbillgates, Reddit, 2023-11-10)</a></li>

      <h4>The future of clinical documentation, 5 stars (Kahnfessions, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</h4>
      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. I’ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
