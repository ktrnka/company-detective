        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Efficiency and Time Savings</h3>
<ul>
<li>"An AI scribe has provided an hour to two hours a day to do something other than data entry. That’s worth quite a lot more than whatever the most expensive one costs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k6lieb9/">(Bruckjo, Reddit, 2023-10-26)</a></li>
<li>"I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use." <a href="https://apple/10481382241">(Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</a></li>
<li>"Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response." <a href="https://apple/11402406988">(Kahnfessions, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</a></li>
<li>"Being a family doc is fun again! Absolutely amazing product!" <a href="https://apple/11346364911">(Game Changer!!, Apple App Store, 2024-06-05)</a></li>

I never see a patient without it now." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emergencymedicine/comments/1d8gz7a/ai_scribes_anyone_as_far_as_i_can_tell_the_last/l77y2pe/">(Praxician94, Reddit, 2024-06-05)</a></li>

<li>"The only slight negative so far is the lack of integration into Epic.

      <h4>The future of clinical documentation, 5 stars (Kahnfessions, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</h4>
      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. I’ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
