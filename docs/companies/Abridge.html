<li>"Tried Abridge and now only use it for simple ortho or uri visits. I don’t like how it formats is a big thing, the other is that it doesn’t include things or worse puts in wrong stuff. Takes me more time to read it after and then try to correct than if I just typed the hpi in the room." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb41g1x/">(EntrepreneurFar7445, Reddit, 2024-07-01)</a></li>

      <h4>The future of clinical documentation, 5 stars (Kahnfessions, Apple App Store, 2024-06-20)</h4>
      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. I’ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
