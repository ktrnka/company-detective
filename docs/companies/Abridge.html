<h3>Efficiency and Time-Saving</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Overall, the AI quality is good, and I like the AVS that it generates as a patient-level recap of the visit." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1deibuu/ai_scribing_so_farwhat_works_and_whats_missing/l8diu3i/">(RyFire41, Reddit, 2024-06-13)</a></li>

<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>

<ul>
<li>"I’ve been using Freed for a few months now and it was great at first but over time it has gotten to the point where it’s actually taking more time to edit the notes than if I had just done them from scratch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/ksmwvq6/">(Aggravating_Shoe2523, Reddit, 2024-02-29)</a></li>
<li>"If they cut the price in half, I'd recommend Freed without any doubt. I wouldn't say it's worth a $100 a month though, especially since Nabla is free and the HPI is the main thing you want from an AI anyway, not plan or AVS." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>

<li>"The other big issue with Abridge is that they store audio recordings of your appointment. That's an absolute no-go for me." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/">(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)</a></li>
<li>"Forces you to use a secondary device. So you have to give it access to all sorts of privacy requests on your iPhone/iPad." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/17h3wai/ai_scribe_personal_vs_institutional_use/k70j5hp/">(None, Reddit, 2023-10-29)</a></li>

      <p>Abridge is truly building the future with this app and the notes editor. Hours saved in documentation every day. And, they work closely with doctors and clinicians. Feedback always gets a speedy response. I hope more health systems pick this up.</p>

      <h4>Huge leap forward for clinicians, 5 stars (Simple_Doc, Apple App Store, 2023-10-16)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Abridge for several years. I love that it has cut my documentation from hours to seconds! It also allows me to be more present when I’m with patients. App and interface is easy to navigate and use. I’ve tried other generative AI ambient documentation solution, but I keep circling back to Abridge. It
Does a great job of summarizing the visit into a concise clinically relavent SOAP note.</p>
