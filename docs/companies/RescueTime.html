      <p>I read online that Apple won’t let RescueTime track app usage for iPhones or iPads. It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.
I do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.

Before I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.

So that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.</p>
