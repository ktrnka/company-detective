      <p>I tried RescueTime with the two-week trial, but it didn’t live up to expectations. The app only tracks time in a basic, non-automated way, forcing you to manually tag and enter time. It doesn’t provide the detailed app usage breakdowns I need, like timestamps or time spent per app at different hours. I expected more, especially for a paid version. Not worth it.</p>

      <h4>Why aren’t you warning iPad users that this app won’t work on iPads?, 2 stars (StrayKatStudio, Apple App Store, 2022-11-20)</h4>
      <p>I read online that Apple won’t let RescueTime track app usage for iPhones or iPads. It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.
I do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.

Before I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.

So that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.</p>

      <p>I’ve been a RescueTime user for years and I’ve come to rely on it to keep me focused while working at my computer. Excited to be able to take that focus with me on my phone!</p>
