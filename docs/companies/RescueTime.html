<li>"Not working at all for me - mobile screen time is staying zero." <a href="https://google_play/303d97c9-2611-49c6-a33b-f993ca1dcfa0">(Amit Levy, Google Play Store, 2021-04-12)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>General Discontent</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I was using Rescuetime several years ago. It was a great app back then - straightforward, easy to use and customize.

<li>"This app is poorly implemented and doesn’t really cooperate with the desktop version; think about it, without the desktop version, why do I want to use this app?" <a href="https://apple/10886750869">(JupiterInTheArea, Apple App Store, 2024-01-31)</a></li>
<li>"Very inaccurate for Android phone activities. Has logged 5h of mobile usage for THIS MONTH, hahahaha." <a href="https://google_play/861b8d51-2951-420e-9c26-7074b278cb7a">(Chrisjan Wust, Google Play Store, 2023-02-14)</a></li>
<li>"You actually have a fantastic shot at making the company ultra relevant again with the ability to use app focus time and yet there's not even a way to control which apps are blocked with Screen Time, this is an extremely mediocre app." <a href="https://apple/10629604961">(disappointed customer12, Apple App Store, 2023-11-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pricing and Subscription Concerns</h2>
<ul>
<li>"The subscription fee is a bit steep though so will see how useful the free version is anyway." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/15rn5pj/is_rescuetime_still_any_good/jwe4xec/">(JollyNeutronStar, Reddit, 2023-08-16)</a></li>

      <p>I was using Rescuetime several years ago. It was a great app back then - straightforward, easy to use and customize. Now it turned into just another piece of garbage, bloated with useless "features", but lacking basic functionality. Have just spent 10 minutes trying to find aout how to customize the categories of activities (a single most needed feature, basically the essence of what Rescuetime should do for me). Failed. RIP, Rescuetime.</p>

I have it installed on my Windows 11 laptop, Samsung phone and tablet. It works fine on the first two but it spontaneously keeps stopping synching data from my tablet. The issue has been reported multiple times to support but it keeps happening. Looking for alternatives.</p>

      <p>My two cents here. Rescuetime is not an "app blocking" app. This is not what it's made for. It's an app that can help you in understanding how you spend your time and makes you find time to do some "deep focus". Overall: it's used to improve your productivity. In addition, they have tools like the one that blocks distracting website. Unfortunately I had to request a refund because currently they don't track correctly subdomains, and this is a crucial feature for me.</p>

      <p>Compared to other products, the thing I miss the most is some kind of adhd mode : a lifecoach for persons who have a difficult time to oganzize their time. Auto enable focus time. Auto warnings when we should stop playing on the phone when we should sleep (no sleep schedule) No tracking tasks Vs what I'm actually doing (playing on ticktock) These functions are important for anything having a difficult time to organise themselves.</p>

I dont get an accurate representation of productivity because the app counts my school app (uncategorised) as neutral, while it's a very productive app for me to be on. Another thing i dont like are the bugs, sometimes my desktop time is simply not recorded at all. Otherwise it's a nice app and it's helped me with productivity alot!</p>

      <p>Too many bugs with focustime premium, you're essentially paying for a service that doesn't work. And too many bugs where the app stops recording data after a few days and you have to reset all the permissions. Customer service is unhelpful by basically telling you to try uninstalling and reinstalling and eventually ignoring your emails after it doesn't work. I had high hopes for this product, but just upgrading to premium is not worth it, unfortunately.</p>

      <h4>Good transition but needs improvement, 3 stars (mattjspeck, Apple App Store, 2023-05-26)</h4>
      <p>I like that Rescuetime is transitioning to an assistant-based approach, but I think they could do it without abandoning the dashboard and metrics—people need both! I also think they could incorporate something similar to their original dashboard into the iPad app, which would make it a lot more useful than the current version which is just a copy of the iPhone app that doesn’t work well on the bigger screen.</p>

      <h4>App is just dis functional, 1 stars (Sushi Eater, Apple App Store, 2023-01-12)</h4>
      <p>I can’t access any info about my stats or anything. I think the developers do not care about the app. The desktop version is great don’t get me wrong, just app is a pile of trash.

Hopefully they fix it, that’s why i’m leaving a 1star</p>

      <h4>It just didn’t work…, 1 stars (xhcheng, Apple App Store, 2022-12-15)</h4>
      <p>I can’t even log in with the same credentials I use on desktop. The older version of app is use-able but doesn’t track phone usage at all (it tracks by sending picking up)… at this rate I’m better off using iOS built-in screen time tracker…</p>

      <h4>Why aren’t you warning iPad users that this app won’t work on iPads?, 2 stars (StrayKatStudio, Apple App Store, 2022-11-20)</h4>
      <p>I read online that Apple won’t let RescueTime track app usage for iPhones or iPads. It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.
I do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.

Before I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.

So that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.</p>

      <p>I’ve been a RescueTime user for years and I’ve come to rely on it to keep me focused while working at my computer. Excited to be able to take that focus with me on my phone!</p>
