<h2>Market Position and Competitors</h2>
<p>RescueTime competes with various time management and productivity tools, including Toggl, Clockify, and Everhour. While RescueTime excels in automatic tracking and productivity analysis, it lacks some features found in competitors, such as invoicing and project management tools. Users have noted that while RescueTime is excellent for personal productivity, it may not fully meet the needs of teams requiring comprehensive project management capabilities <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</p>
<h2>User Feedback and Reviews</h2>
<h3>Positive Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users appreciate the <strong>automatic tracking</strong> feature, which provides an accurate overview of their daily activities without manual input. Many find the <strong>Focus Sessions</strong> particularly helpful for maintaining concentration during work hours <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>detailed reporting</strong> and visualizations of productivity trends have been praised for helping users identify their most productive times and areas needing improvement <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some users have expressed concerns about the <strong>mobile app's performance</strong>, citing bugs and a less intuitive user interface compared to the desktop version. Additionally, there are privacy concerns regarding the extensive data tracking capabilities of the software <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>pricing</strong> for the premium version has been criticized as being high relative to the features offered, especially when compared to competitors that provide more comprehensive project management tools <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, RescueTime is a robust tool for individuals and teams looking to enhance productivity through automatic time tracking and detailed reporting. While it has received positive feedback for its core features, it faces challenges in mobile performance and competition from more comprehensive project management tools. As the company continues to innovate and expand its integrations, it remains a strong contender in the productivity software market.</p>

      <h4>Why aren’t you warning iPad users that this app won’t work on iPads?, 2 stars (StrayKatStudio, Apple App Store, 2022-11-20)</h4>
      <p>I read online that Apple won’t let RescueTime track app usage for iPhones or iPads. It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.
I do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.

Before I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.

So that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.</p>
