<h2>Customers and Market</h2>
<p>RescueTime serves a diverse range of customers, including knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, remote teams, and students. The company primarily operates in the B2C space but also offers solutions for teams, making it relevant for small businesses and remote work environments. The software is distributed through direct downloads from the company's website, and it integrates with tools like Slack and Google Calendar to enhance its functionality <a href="https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports">(RescueTime, 2024-06-20)</a>.</p>
<h2>Company Evolution</h2>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h3>New Features and Integrations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slack Integration</strong>: Introduced in May 2024, this feature allows users to update their Slack status based on their work category, enhancing team communication <a href="https://help.rescuetime.com/article/210-slack">(RescueTime, 2024-05-23)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Team Reports</strong>: Launched in June 2024, these reports provide aggregated statistics on team members' time usage, fostering transparency and productivity <a href="https://help.rescuetime.com/article/35-team-reports">(RescueTime, 2024-06-20)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox Extension</strong>: Released in July 2024, this extension allows Mac OS users to track their browser activity more effectively <a href="https://help.rescuetime.com/article/115-installing-rescuetime-for-firefox">(RescueTime, 2024-07-11)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Market Position and Competitors</h2>
<p>RescueTime competes with other time-tracking and productivity tools such as Toggl Track, Time Doctor, and Everhour. While RescueTime excels in automatic tracking and productivity insights, it lacks some project management features that competitors provide, which may limit its appeal to teams needing comprehensive project oversight <a href="https://timeular.com/blog/best-rescuetime-alternatives/">(Timeular, 2024-01-26)</a>.</p>
<h2>User Feedback and Reviews</h2>
<h3>Positive Aspects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users appreciate the automatic tracking feature, which requires minimal manual input.</li>
<li>The detailed reports and productivity scores help users identify their most productive times and areas for improvement <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Aspects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users have reported bugs and a less intuitive interface on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Some users express privacy concerns due to the comprehensive data collection <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Executive Insights</h2>
<p>Asim Qureshi, CEO of Jibble, noted that while RescueTime is effective for personal productivity, it lacks essential features for workforce management, such as invoicing and project tracking. He emphasized that RescueTime is best suited for individuals looking to enhance their productivity rather than teams needing comprehensive project management tools <a href="https://www.jibble.io/reviews/rescuetime">(Jibble.io, 2023-12-09)</a>.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>RescueTime is a powerful tool for individuals seeking to improve their productivity through automatic time tracking and insightful reporting. However, its limitations in project management and mobile functionality may deter teams looking for a more comprehensive solution. As the company continues to evolve and integrate new features, it remains a strong contender in the productivity software market, particularly for individual users and small teams focused on personal productivity enhancement.</p>

<li>"That's all I use! It's mostly as a motivator to stay off of sites like Reddit, or at least to be thrifty with the time I spend here. That can be accomplished with the free version pretty easily!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/15rn5pj/is_rescuetime_still_any_good/jwe7h7x/">(jasonmehmel, Reddit, 2023-08-16)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Usability and Features</h3>

</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I've been unable to get my phone to sync for a year properly with Rescuetime... no luck, error I can't find stops it from working within a few days of fixing it every time... - and I repair computers and phones as a side hustle, in tech for 20yr... I'm giving up with it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/15rn5pj/is_rescuetime_still_any_good/l655znt/">(Buuunta, Reddit, 2024-05-29)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Subscription Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I just installed Welltory and <em>love</em> it and came across Rescuetime because of this so I have installed the client and integrated it on my phone and home PC however it seems it needs a costly AU$100 / year to do anything useful?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueTime/comments/15rn5pj/is_rescuetime_still_any_good/">(JollyNeutronStar, Reddit, 2023-08-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>

There doesn't seem to be any way to get a subscription for this. What is the point of this app exactly? At least RescueTime classic still works.</p>

      <p>Should be simple and straightforward. Is not. Unfortunately, paid a yearly subscription and lost a lot of time trying to make it work : usability is low (eg. 4+ different interfaces, have you tried the "rtx" web interface on a mobile?), data quality is so low that actionability is irrelevant, guidance is non-existent (I shouldn't have to "debug" a paid service)</p>

      <p>I like that Rescuetime is transitioning to an assistant-based approach, but I think they could do it without abandoning the dashboard and metrics—people need both! I also think they could incorporate something similar to their original dashboard into the iPad app, which would make it a lot more useful than the current version which is just a copy of the iPhone app that doesn’t work well on the bigger screen.</p>

      <h4>Why aren’t you warning iPad users that this app won’t work on iPads?, 2 stars (StrayKatStudio, Apple App Store, 2022-11-20)</h4>
      <p>I read online that Apple won’t let RescueTime track app usage for iPhones or iPads. It would have saved me some time frustration if the app description had just said that, or at least said it when I opened the app. Unless something has changed? I’d love to actually use this app. I used it probably 10 years ago, and loved it. I even paid for it for quite a while. Now I’m trying to reduce my streaming time, so I was wanting to use the basic features again.
I do all my streaming on my iPad, so if RescueTime can’t track app usage here, then this won’t work for me.

Before I read that this won’t work on my iPad, when I installed this app and created a new account with my new email and signed in, it only let me choose between the 2 paid versions. There was no way to select the free version.

So that’s not a great user interface on both counts. This has all just been a waste of time.</p>
