</ul>
<h3>Lack of Content and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Palia was a big miss for me, and I'm basically the intended audience. I love cozy and crafting games, and love MMOs.

</ul>
<h3>Gameplay Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Palia felt restrictive. If the goal was to move away entirely from pvp and combat more generally... you had to have had more freedom for players to build solo, build together to make a village, a town, a city." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1bz2e0z/palia_developers_singularity_6_axes_35_of_staff/kyn4d7g/">(generalmasandra, Reddit, 2024-04-08)</a></li>

      <h4>Thumbs Up (Anonymous, Steam, 2024-07-23)</h4>
      <p>I have been playing since Open Beta started last August, longer than I have been playing on Steam. There are things that I learned recently that I wish I had known from the beginning. 
1. Female Frame Avatars have a built-in disadvantage while hunting, fishing, and other activities. This is cruel and unfair, I hope it changes.
2. Most rare fish/bugs are locked until you reach a higher level in those skills, at least level 25! Some won't unlock til level 50!!!
3. Fishing is setup like real fishing. When you hear the chime, start to pull the fish in, if it starts to fight, stop. Then pull it in a lil more, stop again. Do this until you can pull it in all the way.
4. Sushi, Fisherman's Brew, Fishstew offer some fishing boosts, so will hook boosters; but they won't be as effective until you reach higher levels in fishing.
5 If you see dark green vines growing on a rock or wooden structure, it's most likely hiding a hidden room.
6. Look under bridges and in boat wrecks for treasure chests. 
7. Temple of the Gales & Temple of the Roots were designed by Satan, don't ragequit if you can't finish them. Find a friend, someone you trust with your life, let them finish it for you. That way you can still get the rewards. 
8. If you are a troll, an insufferable twat, or Elon Musk, you should romance Kenyatta or Tomala, they are both pure evil. 
9. Any time you get invited to the mayor's house for a party, talk to all the guests first, before completing the quest, once it's over you'll be booted out and you'll miss out on some juicy lore. 
10. If you find a strange shiny rock near ruins, keep it, never delete it. It will be useful later :)
11. If you find a grove of Flow Trees before anyone else, or Palium ore, don't be a dick, share the news in chat. Give map coordinates, location, set off a flare. For the grove, wait at least til 3am to chop. Set off a honey lure to keep people busy so they don't chop early.
12. If someone is being a Troll Jackhole, you can report them directly from chat and block them.
13. Party up! Fill your Focus! Both will boost skill gain by a lot! 
14. Yes I know the pets are cute and the premium outfits look amazing, but they really add nothing to the game except elitism and lag. Do not feel pressured to buy any. Currently if you were to buy every outfit, pet & tool skin, it would be over $2,000.00 USD! 
15. OH When you get Renown use it to boost Focus first, by going to the Phoenix Shrine (the big bird where you first spawned) and the Dragon Shrine (follow Chayne). Both max out at 1,000 points. After that you can use Renown to buy plots of land, and building supplies from City Hall. 
16. The houses are just vanity projects, don't feel pressured to build a large one, we don't need to eat, sleep or poo. And there is no weather.
17. When crafting furniture, craft every individual item in a set first, before crafting duplicates. You will level up soooo fast!
18. Cake Parties are for A-Type Micro-Manager Extroverts. If you are a Neurodivergent, Introverted, Weirdo, they will send you into a panic attack. Do it once for the quest, then never again. 
19. Build a big kitchen house, with 4 each of: chopping & mixing stations, stoves & baker's ovens. Invite chill friends over to cook together, as lot as each person does one task, you should all get a copy of the food. You can stack tasks too, like 2 people can both chop onions.
20. There are Eshe-Holes in the game who want it to be a Fortnite nightmare of PVP warfare. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS. Palia is cozy, chill, wonderful.
21. Muujins suck. Don't all charge at the Disco Deer, be smart, take your positions and shoot 2 Dispell and 1 Slow Down Arrows at it. Save goes for Greg and the Silver Chapaas! Be patient when hunting Elder and Magic animals, they love to run and teleport, be ready to run run run!</p>

      <p>I have enjoyed this game so much more than I thought. It's nice to play a game that is kind of like Minecraft meets Animal Crossing. I love that I don't have enemies to fight, no one can hurt/hunt me, there is no fall damage, crops don't die if you can't water them right away, and that, so far, everyone has been very helpful and friendly. It's nice to have a pleasant world to escape too. The only downfall....I've done almost all the quests and waiting for more. I'm working to upgrade my skills for now.</p>

      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2024-08-01)</h4>
      <p>This game is basically Stardew Valley if it was 3D and had a quarter of the content. You set up your farm with crops and  crafting benches, make friends with the villagers, complete quests, gather and give gifts, complete weekly tasks and hoard a lot of stuff. The villagers are very likeable with a personality for each type of player, and you can romance every romance option at the same time. The latest patch (at the time of writing this) also added a system where you can show off your farm plots to other players to recieve rewards, for those people who love to build stuff and prance their creations around.

However, the game also has plenty of problems.
- There are only two areas to explore, three if you count your farm. Nothing has been added in a year.
- There are only three types of ore and three types of wood. The highest tier of both is a rare resource that has to be farmed.
- There are no farm animals. You get a couple of crops and you better be happy with it.
- The cash shop is very expensive and seems to be the biggest focus in every update, especially after Daybreak Games bought Singularity 6.
- There are lots of bugs and every update breaks something else. Animals glitching into rocks and trees, loot bags getting stuck in unreachable areas, aquariums turning into dark squares, planted trees that stop growing, paths and furniture moving on its own, the list goes on.

My recommendation: play it for the quests and villager interactions and then drop it. The game drops down hard once you run out of those things, and since 75% of Singularity 6's staff was let go after the acquisition, i wouldn't expect any banger content to be added any time soon.</p>

      <p>I'd love to play this game but I can't. The seizure warning is buried in the screens you get after making an account and after logging in, after the news/updates page. Only then is there a seizure warning and you can't even exit the game after seeing the warning. I had to dismiss the warning, thinking there would be an option to exit on the next screen. But it just goes directly into a bright pulsating light for the character creation menu. At least give me the option to bail at the warning! Be upfront about the warning!</p>

      <p>Super cozy! I have enjoyed several hours in this game and I am ready to spend several more.
It has all the things I enjoy in regular MMOs such as gathering, crafting, building up my own space, etc. I am also just a sucker for any game that has fishing >.> and these folks deliver on the fishing. Use bait. Don't use bait. Get better fishing rods. Get all the achievements! Then they make it even better by, and this goes for anything you're doing in the game, giving you bonuses if you do the activity with others. This is legitimately one of the best and most helpful communities I have seen in a game.</p>

      <p>I really wanted to like Palia, but I couldn't stay excited about it past release. The lack of animated cutscenes makes all the stories feel empty and dull - for a game with otherwise nice character animation and environments, it feels strange to not actually see events *happen*, rather than just being told about them. Am I in this world or am I not? Is it a book or a 3D environment? 
There are gameplay aspects that are... fun enough, out of context. They're okay. It's not fun enough to farm or hunt in Palia to log on just for that, which is the problem. The gameplay doesn't hold up alone; the story without cutscenes doesn't hold up alone; the character design and home customisation don't hold up alone; everything is lacking in specific ways that just don't make it very exciting to play. 

It's an okay game on many fronts but not a great game on any. Honestly, its strongest point are the character animations, but they feel meaningless without a more exciting storyline with animated cutscenes. The writing isn't bad, but it feels wasted on these disconnected visual novel dialogues. If the devs focused on telling the story with exciting cutscenes, that could be the thing that made Palia stand out. 

For a game that put a lot of emphasis on being a wholesome social place to hang out and make friends, the chat system and the server system don't feel inviting at all. I can't be bothered to talk to people beyond bare minimum (for materials), because the chat isn't well designed. 

I have zero interest in paying 30 bucks for some cosmetic items if there isn't enough effort put into making the game more fun to play and the story more engaging to parttake in with animated cutscenes. AND, on top of that, the character customisation is not very good. It's just okay. What are you really paying for? A mid outfit for a mid character for a mid game. If things don't change, I don't recommend anyone to spend that money on this game, when you could be getting things of higher quality and more fun by spending it on other games. 

Again, I really wanted to like the game. And I hope if the devs read reviews, that they can listen and take to heart the issues with Palia that hold it back. You have to question "is this fun?" when you're making a game and when you're designing the way the story is being told. Palia has some good bases to build on, the gameplay has parts that are kinda fun, the character animations are nice, it's just not quite enough. So far, Palia isn't more than a good base for a game.</p>

      <p>Too bad...

friends hyped me up to install and play this game.
I started character creation and realized I didn't have any game sound - so selecting a character voice was impossible.
Tried to back out into the main screen - it wouldn't let me.
Ended up giving the character a random letter name (like hahjfkef) just to get out of character creation and back to settings to fix my audio... turns out YOU CAN'T DELETE THE CHARACTER or make a new one. No option to re-name or re-configure. Just no options at all.
Guess I won't be playing this, then, until they fix this most basic feature...</p>

      <p>Palia is a community simulation game that offers players a cozy and engaging experience in a vibrant world. Marketed as a social MMO, it emphasizes crafting, building, and community interactions. While the game has a charming atmosphere and a variety of activities, it also faces some challenges and limitations.

The gameplay allows players to engage in activities like gathering, crafting, and building. The customization options, especially for home plots, offer a personal touch and can be satisfying. However, the game is not without issues; technical problems, such as items freezing in place or becoming untouchable, can disrupt the gameplay experience.

Despite being designed as a social MMO, Palia often feels more solitary than intended. Many players tend to focus on individual tasks rather than engaging in community interactions, making the world feel less connected and lively.

The game initially offers a variety of tasks and quests, but it quickly becomes repetitive. Once players complete the available content, they find themselves waiting for updates to continue progressing. The skills system provides medals as rewards for upgrades, which can be traded for items. However, the selection is limited, and once players have fully customized their home plots, there is little left to do.

While Palia features a range of NPCs, their dialogue becomes repetitive over time, reducing the sense of immersion and making the interactions feel stale.

Palia features cosmetic microtransactions, with items purchasable using "Palia Coins." Prices range from $4.99 for 425 coins to $99.99 for 11,050 coins, with higher tiers offering bonus coins. These purchases are purely cosmetic and do not impact gameplay. However, the selection, especially for male characters, is limited. This can be disappointing for players looking for more customization options. Some players may find themselves spending significant amounts— I've spent upwards of $150.

An easy way to earn gold coins in the game is through cake/cooking parties. However, these sessions can become monotonous, requiring long periods of repetitive button and mouse clicking, which can detract from the overall enjoyment.

Palia lays the groundwork for a charming and engaging community simulation game but is held back by technical issues, repetitive content, and limited social interactions. The game may appeal to players looking for a relaxing, casual experience, but it could benefit from more content, expanded customization options, and improved social features to maintain long-term interest.</p>

      <p>Can't change character names or altogether delete characters and would need to make a new account. Your "full name" is what people see instead of your nickname. it's a pain in the butt to sign up and link accounts. Already dealt with bugs at the beginning of the game, with weird solid walls and cut off speech with the NPCs. Not all of it looks/is bad, but its not worth the hassle.</p>

      <p>This rocks! This is just like Stardew Valley and Sun Haven. You mine, fish, farm, cook, build your house and furniture, romance characters, do quests,  kill creatures, harvest plants and cut trees. You can be in a poly relationship. I'm not sure if you can marry anyone but they can be your lover. You can play with your friends like WoW. There isn't any fighting over resources when you play with your friends because even if you are working on the same tree, rock, quests, or plant, everyone receives the same resources. You can fast travel from anywhere in Palia to your home lot. You can have gliders to fly, pets, and outfits that are just for show. Fishing is a lot easier then in Stawdew Valley or Sun Haven. 

It's just a really fun game. I spent 6 hours playing for the first time in one go. Great Job making it!</p>

      <p>the premise is nice, so is the design but I'm not sure if its just my PC or if its actually the game but first night I was able play it fine, 3rd day attempting it has provided nothing but issues. The mouse cursor doesn't line up, had graphics problems, once it even made my computer crash. I'm sure if I could get it to work I would love it but at the current state it's in it is not playable. only plus side is that it was free.</p>

      <p>I mean, it's not bad. The only thing I really don't understand is the "multiplayer." You come across a few people that are doing their own thing. You can't interact with them outside of typing in chat which is rarely used unless you go outside of the main map. If you stayed in the main map, you would think they were bots. From what I've seen, the only thing you can actually do with other people is hunt, collect and fish together. It doesn't look like you can do much of the "co-op" experience. Everyone I've come across and spoken to has been very friendly. But yeah, if you expected a co-op experience where you could do everything with your friend, this is not it. 

I do wish that the UI when it comes to friendships was a little more simplified. It's extremely annoying to have to click on every character in my friendship tab to remember what it was they wanted. A list of all the wants besides the characters name would be great. It's unbelievably annoying that if you gift someone something before you ask them what they want, you now have to wait an entire real life day to give them what they said they wanted. IMO, the method Stardew Valley uses of the two gifts per week + whatever they say they want/need would be much better here. 

If you wanted a game where you didn't have to think all too hard and plan things out, this is for you.</p>

I was looking for a new farming sim type game to play, and noticed this one is free to play! I am telling you, you get SO much fun just playing. The only time you spend money (if you so choose) is on cosmetic things like outfits, tool skins, pets, etc. The game itself is fun and relaxing, and I would recommend you give it a try!</p>

If you want to build stuff, build stuff. If you want to catch bugs, go get em. You wan to sit and do nothing, do nothing. There's a lot to do, or not do.

      <p>After putting in over 30 hours myself, and my girlfriend has put in about 90 hours, I can confidently say this game was made for us!
Over the years we have played many games of this genre and have always had things we wished were done better, but we both really feel everything about this game is just perfect for us.  I highly recommend for anyone interested in games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia/Sandrock, Disney Dreamlight Valley, Coral Island, Hokko Life, Palworld, Cozy Grove, Yonder, Story of Seasons. While all these games are different in their own way, we feel Palia just takes the best of them all and puts it together perfectly in a Massively Multiplayer Online social format similar to that of games like World of Warcraft (without combat). I cannot recommend this one enough!!</p>

      <p>This is like The Sims decided to take a vacation in a fantasy land and brought Pinterest along for the ride. It’s a game where you can farm, fish, and frolic with more enthusiasm than a Labrador at a ball pit. This cozy MMO is packed with so much charm, it could probably power a small village.

Character customization? Let’s just say you’ll spend more time perfecting your avatar’s look than you do deciding what to wear in real life (if you havethe money for it). The housing system is a decorator's dream – it’s like HGTV on magical steroids. Want a house by the enchanted forest? Done. Fancy a beachside villa? Absolutely, why not?

Gameplay in "Palia" is as relaxing as a hammock on a summer day. The quests are less about saving the world and more about enjoying your whimsical, low-stress life. It's basically a never-ending vacation where the biggest challenge is deciding whether to plant pumpkins or carrots.

It is a delightful escape from reality where you can live out your fantasy of being a farmer-fisher-decorator-adventurer all at once. It’s the perfect game for anyone who’s ever wished they could live inside a charming storybook – complete with fairy lights and an endless supply of cute outfits. If you need a break from reality, Palia is the ultimate feel-good fantasy retreat that you'll never want to leave.</p>

      <p>I was gifted this game by my son because I saw it while scrolling through all the games on Steam and thought the graphics were great. I LOVE the beautiful graphics and the challenge of figuring out how to play without a lot of game guides next to me. What I haven't enjoyed is my computer crashing on me because my graphics card isn't hefty enough to handle this game. It's a good thing I'm not a serious gamer. I'm able to tone down my details and still have stunning gameplay. Maybe make this more normal person PC friendly? Otherwise, I'm happy to play for hours!! The kid in me woke up! :)</p>

Because I did have a few gltiches such as trying to enter town from my farm and not being able to, and then the sky texture kinda blurred my screen once everytime I walked through a spot on my farm. ( The sky did resolve it's own issue somehow at one point lol) I enjoyed this a lot. 7/10</p>

      <p>EDIT:

Okay, so I've become addicted to this game, BUT I still am marking it as not recommended.

If I could mark it as neutral, I would.

If you are looking for a farming MMO, this is not it. It's not like you're able to walk around a neighborhood and say hi to your neighbors. Sadly, a game doesn't exist like that yet. 

If you are DESPERATE for a pet + outfits, there is a cheap $8.50 bundle that has 4 outfits (with color palette swaps) + getting a brown cat for your first premium money purchase. That's as of writing this review. That might change in the future.

As for the slow animations I mentioned before, yes they are still slow, but when you get tool upgrades, your chores go by much much quicker. Also, look up garden layouts for maximum water retention so you don't have to water your crops every damn hour (YES, EVERY IRL HOUR).

So, why am I addicted to this game? I refuse to spend anymore money on it beyond taht $8.50 bundle because this whole game could shut down within the next year, and it's honestly stilll a buggy mess.

to be honest, it just gives that nice dopamine hit when you wanna chill and do no brain stuff like mining for ore, cutting down trees, crafting furniture, shoot deer and red pandas, etc. Maybe it's my ADHD and autism that makes it satisfying.

Story still isn't engaging. Writing still sucks in my opinion. Some of the main story quests and bugged to hell and back and haven't been fixed since they got released. 

Making money does get easier once you hit your stride but yes, the beginning is really damn slow.

The community has been really nice IMO. The "unspoken" rules are easy to understand and they aren't a pain. 

People are willing to help you understand. Just gotta ask.

Basically, call out rare resources like palium, flow trees, magical hunting targets, rare forage materials, etc with the map coordinates, and flare if you can with everything except the hunting targets.

Oh yeah, another big downside.

This damn game takes 33gb if you use their client. On steam, I think it takes around 20. To give you an idea of how unnecessary big and and unoptimized this game is...

Final Fantasy 14 Online, with all the expansions including Dawntrail....takes only 90GB on your hard drive. 

Unfortunately, it looks like optimization and bug fixes are not a priority for the devs at this point.

If you can't handle that, don't bother playing the game. As much as I like this game, once stuff starts filling up on my second hard drive, this game is on the chopping block of getting uninstalled. Which is another reason why I refuse to spend more than $8.50.

I think some people were complaining about cliques, but I don't find the game cliquey at all. Again, people are always willing to help out. 


Original review:

Played it on their app instead of steam. I tried to enjoy it. I played it for a good 10 hours. It's not worth it. The premium shop prices are egregious. Upwards of $30-60 for an outfit that just comes with palette swaps??? "It's optional!" I don't care if it's optional. They should not be charging that much money for outfits. Especially if you want your character to look nice, have a pet, etc. All the good looking cosmetics are locked behind high prices when if you're f2p, you're locked into the basic look. 

It's so boring too. Everything, I MEAN EVERYTHING, is slow. I know it's supposed to be relaxing, but this isn't it. Other farming sims have quick animations and are still relaxing. 

I wanted to try Palia gain because I enjoy decoration. Forget that. Earning money is an awful grind. Unfortunately, a lot of the problems are fundamental stuff. 

And even worse, the world is just....empty. Ruins? Sure. Small little village? Yeah. But it's a bunch of open field with NOTHING! Apparently this is some sort of post apocalyptic world? I've never found that a good excuse though.

Oh and the characters. Forget it. The are cringey as all hell and forgettable. "Wait until you get to know them more!" No. Good writing is supposed to hook you and make you care about the story and character pretty damn quick. Otherwise, why else am I putting up with this gameplay???

Oh and even funnier. It won't let me uninstall the damn thing without a workaround when it comes to using their client. If you are gonna try the game, do it through Steam. There's more I wanna say, but I just am baffled.</p>

      <p>ok by the number of hours i put into this i must have enjoyed it. It was free who wouldnt.  But its boring when you are losing the will to live, you play this. When you have half an hour of boredom to spend you play this. I am now going to uninstall because of the very very little enjoyment i did get, has been taken away from me because they updated the game & altered the graphics, all of my pretty little boxes with critters in, were now black boxes & no amount changes to the graphics made any difference, Bye Bye i wont miss you.</p>

      <p>there is a tldr at the bottom of this review since it is a bit lengthy.
i don't usually leave reviews but i was so taken aback by just how poor several key aspects of this game are i feel compelled. you should take any money you might have spent on this game's insanely overpriced cosmetics and find yourself something else. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit in palia. there are plenty of games that do well what palia is attempting and failing to do. it is hard to believe this game had a $50 mil budget and the devs are industry veterans.
this studio has gone through massive layoffs a few times and an acquisition recently so this game may not have much time left anyway. reading reviews from people who have been playing since alpha, the devs are also known to be actively hostile toward players and have been on more than one occasion on blog posts and on discord, including threatening to make the game worse on purpose, that's always a good sign.

it should also be noted i absolutely do not hate this game for being "woke" and i, as someone who would be considered "woke" through my sheer existence, actually have no idea what so many simpletons in the reviews are referring to as "woke" unless they mean the fact that... you can play as a black person? there are women in the game? i seriously have no clue. if you are going into a game expecting every single character to be a macho white man and the fact that other people exist offends your delicate snowflake sensibilities, then that is your own fault for being immature and unable to cope with reality, and you would also benefit from therapy. trust me, you'd feel a lot better after getting help. if you think this game is "woke" i have no idea how you can even leave your house without having a meltdown. anyway, let's get started.

i tried this out for a few hours and it was okay gameplay-wise, but there are too many issues to make it worth putting more time into. the world is quite small (there are TWO areas, your house and the village) and visually it is not very interesting. it is your standard generic fantasy village. the art style and design for the player character is generic too. there's not much to do or work toward in the game because of poor choices i discuss later. it's basically just grind grind grind grind grind and wait wait wait wait.
you can chop down trees, break rocks, pick up stuff you find on the ground, garden a very small variety of crops in a very small garden, fish or catch bugs, craft items to decorate your house, do quests (note there is no combat in this game, so all quests are fetch quests), romance the characters by giving them items, and stand around and wait for time to pass. apparently there is a minigame you can play with other players, but in my time i barely saw anyone else. you'll be waiting in line on load screens to access almost empty or totally empty servers.
what there is available to do is pretty chill provided you like grinding because that's literally all there is to do in this game, and it might be fun to play with friends to get more mileage out of the limited amount of features, but on your own (and factoring in the game's other huge shortcomings which i am about to go into) it gets old fast. especially if you have played pretty much any other game of this genre. the amount of highly positive reviews for palia really surprises me since there are so many significantly more robust similar games out there.

the biggest issue, however, is the character creator leaves A LOT to be desired, the cosmetics are hideously overpriced ($25+ on the LOW end of things), and there are literally zero free cosmetics or pets in the game outside of the default clothing in the character creator.

the diversity in body types, facial features, etc seen in NPCs in the game puts the character creator to shame. there is one female and one male body type and both of them are thin. there are no sliders of any kind. you cannot remove the exaggerated eyelashes from the female player character. you cannot mix and match facial features and face shapes. face shapes and features are gender locked. i'm basically playing as some generic fortnite looking ass dude. it is absolutely one of the worst character creators i have ever encountered in a modern game. i think i would have genuinely preferred being given no character creation options whatsoever.
i figured, well, at least i will be able to customize myself in other ways once i get started, such as cute cosmetics. i was wrong! as i mentioned, you CANNOT obtain any cosmetics! you only get the boring default ones in the character creator. ALL cosmetic items such as clothes and weapon skins are purchased with real money, and they are egregiously expensive. you have to pay for each individual clothing color scheme as well. pets are also purchased with real money.
i guess they have to be expensive because there is no other monetization and therefore no other way for them to make money. seems like a recipe for disaster in the first place, not that i enjoy having to pay for things, but this isn't tf2 or fortnite where you have a reason to play other than cosmetics, this is a game in a genre that is known for character customization as one of the key pillars of gameplay, and this strips the gameplay aspect from it entirely. i am not willing to shell out $20+ on a SINGLE ITEM of virtual clothing in a game that might not even last the rest of the year considering what's been going on with the studio, especially since it has such poor character customization to begin with. i described the player as a fortnite looking ass dude due to how generic the art style and design is, and it seems to take after fortnite in the expensive cosmetics department as well; although the cosmetics prices in palia generally cost even more than fortnite cosmetics! just because fortnite does it, doesn't mean you should!
i exited and uninstalled palia due to my extreme disappointment the moment i figured this out. character customization is one of the single most important elements of video games like this. as i said, it is typically one of the pillars of gameplay in this genre, and one of many different things to work toward in games that are better than palia. without it, the game is severely lacking in things that feel worth striving toward, and i feel no connection to the player character or world. i am truly baffled that it is such an afterthought in a game that's supposed to be cozy, where you can build and decorate a house and even romance the characters. if you cannot immerse yourself in the world, why even bother?
they seem to think that plushie collecting is enough to make up for the fact that you can only look nice if you want to spend egregious amounts of money... and it's just not...

tldr: imo there is not much incentive to spend time in the world of palia if you don't want to open your wallet. the gameplay is just grinding or waiting around, and ALL cosmetic items and pets are paid for with real money and are expensive. you could buy a full, better game for the price of one outfit. there are no cosmetics outside of the character creator, which itself is one of the worst character creators i have ever seen. the lack of cosmetics and pets is a huge blow to the game. without them there is not much to work toward. there are also not many other players. you have to wait in line on load screens to enter empty or almost empty servers.
if you want to play anyway, be wary about spending real money, as the studio behind it is going through rough times (multiple rounds of massive layoffs and being purchased by another company followed by even more layoffs) and it is quite possible this game will be abandoned or even shuttered in the near future. the devs have also lashed out against the playerbase in blog posts and on discord multiple times. 

who knows. with any luck, maybe this will turn into something better at some point in its future, if it has one.</p>

However paying USD$50.00 for an outfit is ABSOLUTELY predatory.

      <p>Initially played with my husband, though he checked out in the first 2 hours due to slow story progression, which wasn't really an issue for me. Little did I know, 79 hours later I'm stuck with 3 uncompleted quests, 2 of which now say 'wait for the story to be continued', my storage is maxed out, villagers' stories are hard to follow because it takes forever to get to the next level with them and you don't have anything to do in the meantime + once you do get the quest you complete it in like 10 minutes and that's it</p>

      <p>There's so much to say. I love this game, its an amazing life sim and you can do so so much. From the tiniest little details in your house / land to building relationships with the npc's and discovering well put together lands. Let alone the music, it's so calming and gives you a really good feeling. You really feel like you're in this world :)
Huge kudos to the team. Keep it up!
But I want this game to thrive. There are certainly big performance issues that come with it. If you have really good specs this might not be an issue for you, but as someone who has right above the recommended specs, this was a nightmare. It would often crash, and at one point I had to hard reset my pc because it didn't let me out of the game when I wanted to leave. My pc has never reached such high temperatures with any game compared to Palia. My partner's laptop battery even died for a while because of Palia. Because of this I've come to the conclusion it is unplayable until this is fixed. I apologize for me not recommending this, but I want people to know that this game can fry ur pc esp if your below the recommended specs. Other than that, It's a very good game that I can't wait to play again.</p>

      <p>Yes, you should play this game. People compare it to Stardew Valley but I think the two games are sufficiently different that it doesn't really hold. Palia is its own thing entirely, and it's great. Free to play, open world, no health bar to worry about (you don't even take fall damage), just a fun and relaxing experience doing whatever you want in the world. The villagers are interesting and varied and the various quests they give you are fun and engaging. Try it out!</p>

      <p>Bought this game nearly 3 weeks ago. 75 hours down, I have to say I'm happy with this free game.

It's still in development, so the story isn't finished and there's only two world areas unlocked. But between the main story, the sidequests to level up NPC relationships, the skill levelling and building your pretty house there's still a lot to do. 

You can invest as much time or as little as you'd like. The cash shop is only for cosmetics, nothing that will help you win or progress. 

The community is one of the nicest online game communities I've met. Everyone's ready to help others, there's a real sense of community spirit between the house voting, helping others with material requests and shared gathering of things like the flow trees and hunting animals. 

If you like cosy small town farming crafting sim games, it's a good'n and for free it's really held its weight up.</p>

      <p>Such a cute and beautiful game. The characters are a lot of fun and the NPC's actually feel like real people. Wish the adventuring side of it felt a bit more fun/engaging though - kind of wish there was more combat or magic, but not sure if that's what the game devs intend for this game.</p>

      <p>I am actually feeling more neutral with the game in its current state, but chose thumbs up in the hopes as it is developed it lives up to its potential.

In its current beta state, I found myself initially enchanted but then bored. So bored. Of doing the same things, talking to the same NPCs and repeating it again and again. I feel like the progression is just too slow paced, or maybe the world is just too small. 

Once there is more content perhaps the devs could speed up the initial grind. The pace just feels so off and unfortunately it bucked my interest in the game because nothing was happening. Adding a lot more home styles and craftable stuff to build with would be a good start so people can be more creative in that regard. (obviously that takes time to implement, but I think it's a worthy goal of the art team, along with adding more color palattes and individual color channel dying to objects like many other games have.

The home building is clearly the end game, which is awesome. Owning a home is a fantasy for many people just as unattainable as weilding magic or slaying dragons. But maybe go all in on it feature-wise, as it is currently anemic.

Again it's not a bad game. It's in Beta. These are the things I would like to see for it to hold my interest personally.</p>

      <p>Good game, fun, free to play... I don't know why anyone would give a bad review on it. That's kinda petty when you paid nothing for it.  If you don't like it, then delete it and you lost nothing. Oh well, you can't make some people happy no matter what you do. I suggest to everyone to ignore the negatives and just try the game out.

      <p>I really enjoy this game! As someone who enjoys games with great graphics and lots to do, but without the fighting aspect. This game is perfect! I would compare it to Genshin ~ without the fighting, which I love!  I am not good at the battling part of most games. Palia is fun, relaxing, and the story line is great too! I really enjoy the puzzles, as well.</p>

      <p>This game is beautiful and so fun to play, but the only problem I've experienced is the sensor of the cursors for selecting items/choices. It's like a whole inch away from the actual selection before it registers what you're trying to pick and on top of that there is an issue with selecting any of the last two column of any of the shops, my inventory, and when changing my character's appearance.</p>

      <p>This game is enjoyable. I originally played it on the Nintendo Switch, but found the performance on that system to not be the best due to the system's age. I quit and just recently asked Customer Support to delete my old character so that I can start a new one. This version runs well and it has Steam Achievements so I am really happy. It is a bit buggy though and it seems to be more buggy than the last time that I played. Like the tutorial pop ups tend to not go away and stay on screen.</p>

      <p>I would love this game, and I would add this game to my normal games I play; but it's a MMO with Micro transactions when it has no business being that. This is harvest moon/stardew valley game but for some reason it puts you in servers with randos and I spent 10 minutes trying to go to my house but the game kept crashing or saying the servers were full. Also all the cosmetics cost real money and there's a quest you can't throw away that requires you to buy a cosmetic so that will just sit in your quest box. 

I would much rather this game be single player with an optional online mode with friends, and I would happily pay a normal on time $20 to play this game and not deal with all the micro transaction garbage. There is way too many loading screens, and movement between servers that's completely unnecessary, and wastes a lot of time.

On the positive notes, this is a very fun game and has really pretty graphics. The developers put time and love into this game, and it is of quality. Just know it has the same trapfalls as every other MMO.</p>

      <p>It's surprisingly really fun. Calm, casual, cosy. The game actively encourages cooperation with other players and rewards kindness. The community is actually really nice, which is bemusing for a free-to-play multiplayer game. The only paid content is cosmetic. 

There is grinding, but it never feels like too much, aside from trying to increase the friendship/romance levels which take forever. 

One caveat, while this is [i] technically [/i] multiplayer in that you can see other people running around the world, you can team up to harvest resources and you can visit each others' homes, you [i] cannot [/i] do quests together. Each quest is instanced and others cannot join you.</p>

      <p>Palia is a lot like Stardew Valley, except in 3D! Which I personally love games like Stardew. Palia also has amazing character in general. I love how much customization there is in the game. The only problem I have with this game is building. I like the building in this game but I wish they had different grid sizes so that it would be easier to make things even or symmetrical. That is my only problem, and it's not that big of one. It truly doesn't affect game play it just is slightly annoying to me and I'm sure a lot of others, but maybe not.</p>

It is very easy to remember all the different commands, which i appreciate, missions are entertaining, i just started so I can't comment more about it, but till now, I've found this game to be very fun to play. It's a fusion of various games i would guess, and the fact that it has an open server so its easy to talk to anyone, simply fun and great. will continue to play this and to recommend it to friends</p>

      <p>A cozy, enjoyable game. I've been playing since the early days where I was screaming at the screen from the glitches yet I stuck around because of the story. It's a much more playable game now and the community is pretty kind. I like logging on and doing some chill gameplay that can be more challenging if you go for the collaborative efforts in hunting and cooking. Still, simple enough to enjoy alone as well.</p>

It's very charming and I was hooked on the character creation screen. The art style and models are cute and nice to look at, the story is interesting enough and there's a lot of fun side-stuff to do and hidden things to discover.

I'm currently in a spot where it feels like I'm not going anywhere, but I'm finally making some progress in some tougher quests so that's getting better.

The game beautifully blends crafting, cooking, fishing, and farming into a seamless experience that feels both relaxing and rewarding. The world is full of life, with colorful characters that each have their own unique charm and stories to share. Exploring the enchanting environment with friends adds a layer of fun and cooperation that’s hard to find elsewhere. And the underlying mystery? It keeps you coming back for more, eager to uncover every secret. Palia truly lets you live the life of your dreams, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for a captivating adventure!</p>

      <p>Instantly addictive! Sure, there are still some occasional bugs, but since it's still technically in beta we can be forgiving! (that's what beta testing is for, after all!) The gameplay is otherwise smooth, controls and camera movement are good, and even interaction with other online players is decent - not as overwhelming as other mmo games because you are put into smaller servers as you move around the world. 

Overall i do highly recommend this game, its fun and interactive, customizing items need more options, but overall its good :)</p>

      <p>Palia is a pretty chill MMORPG that has an interesting storyline and quests, and requires lots crafting and gathering resources. It kind of gives me slight WoW vibes, but there is no PVE/PVP (that I'm aware of so far). It's a friendly game and can be played by the whole family. In fact, if you're looking to introduce your kids to the world of MMORPGs, then I'd highly recommend this one. The only downside is there are limited character customization options so far. It would be great to have more clothing, hairstyles, etc to choose from.</p>

Didnt expect much at first, but ive been hooked on the game from day one. 
The gameplay itself is chill af, you cant do anything wrong basically.
It is grindy though, like alot. But even that process is chill, go around, look for what you need, look up in the sky after flares, they indicate someone else found good shit.

As a male ARPG and MMO gamer i never thought this game would hit me this hard!
There are bugs, keep in mind its still early acces. But thats fine, it will get fixed eventually</p>

Can hunt, forage, mine, lumber, meet and greet the villagers, with great personalities and stories, You have a homestead you can build up and multiple lots, so each lot could be a different theme. Game is fully free, dont have to pay to play and enjoy. the only thing real life money is needed is just aesthetics, like outfits, but you do have a good selection to choose from for free. It is just such a nice relaxing game, and has two huge areas, with more down the road. There is a story that unfolds, as you try to find out what happened to your people and how come you returned. So come join the community, and join the fun,</p>

However, with devoted devs and community, there are always improvements made to the game. Not to mention how helpful other players are in game.

All in all, if you want a good story, or calming game with friends, or even to explore vast secrets of another world, this game is definitely for you.</p>

      <p>Very cozy game and quite well established for a beta version. It is similar to Stardew Valley and Coral Island but in first person. The detailed house building is amazing as well. Looking forward to see how it develops further.</p>

      <p>I have been playing since open beta last August. Just realized its on steam. I think its a good game but has the potential to be even better. The fishing could be a tad easier, but isnt too bad once you get the hang of it. I think having things unlock at higher levels is fair but maybe certain intervals would be better instead of 25 and 50+. There should be a better way to aquire fun/exclusive items not just from buying them from the shop. But overall the community and their discord id helpful and fun and the game is def a cozy game.</p>

      <p>Very laggy and quite buggy too. Constant intrusive pop ups blocking half your screen off (At least at the start of the game I don't know if it continues but it's annoying the hell out of me). VERY lack luster and grim character creation... But complimented with micro transaction cosmetic store that seems to get a lot of effort put into it.

The game may improve later on for all I know, but I don't think I'll be finding out. It was a trashy start, and theres so many other games like this to choose from that just feel better in my opinion... Uninstalled for now.</p>

      <p>If Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing had a baby, it would be Palia. It's the perfect place to live out your ultimate cozy fantasy of fishing, farming, and befriending adorable NPCs. The only stress you’ll face is deciding whether to decorate your house or go on a butterfly-catching spree. Warning: highly addictive, may cause sudden urges to abandon real life and move to a virtual village where everything is just... better. 🏡🌼</p>

      <p>Palia is super cute! It reminds me of but is not too similar to the games "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" and "Stardew Valley." It's the perfect cozy game to get invested in, but it's fast-paced enough to keep me engaged. So far, Palia has impressed me.</p>

      <p>This is such a soothing and enjoyable game! I love the characters and their personalities and relationships, the lore, the world, and it's easy to get into even if you aren't a skilled gamer. There's no pressure to interact with other players directly, even though it's a multiplayer game, and it's a very immersive and developed world. Such a pleasant game. Overall, would recommend! :) The scripts of the characters are fun, the voice actors all do a great job bringing life into the game, the concepts are clever, most of the puzzles are rewarding to figure out on the tougher quests (although I wish they'd have some sort of difficulty level feature on quests before you accept them? or a way to refuse quests for the time being.)

Edit: I will warn-- the Silverwing Quest with Eloise and Caleri is HARD and FRUSTRATING! This problem doesn't really arise anywhere else in the game, but do not be a hero, just look up a youtube walkthrough (even with the walkthrough it's still outstandingly tedious and I would not recommend this specific quest. A lot of people are stuck on it, and it's very stressful in contrast to the rest of the game, which is a little disappointing.)</p>

      <p>I love it. It's a pretty calm and relaxing game. It's basically a mashup of animal crossing, stardew valley, and disney dreamlight valley. But it would be nice if the button hit boxes worked for me. It worked at first, but I had to stop playing  because of how frustrating it was for me. I can't mark any villagers or locations on the map or do much since that doesn't work. The game itself though is nice and I like it.</p>

      <p>All of my games have a lot of combat and with small kids this is a perfect "care bear" game that I can play when they watch over my shoulder. I find myself playing well after bedtime however. This game is all about the grind but incorporates feel good small town with the progression you look for in an RPG. The community is positive and inclusive, this game is kind of like meditation or a vacation from more intense, competitive games. I'd rate it G if it were a movie. I've put a lot of hours in 100+ hours and plan to put in many more</p>

      <p>The game is very fun! I find many aspects similar to Stardew Valley, but as a third-person RPG? The quests are interesting and there's lots to do. Great for ADHD, if you're prepared to sit down and play a game for hours haha. There are still some glitches, of course, it's the beta version. But to be honest, lots of games release their full versions in worse condition. This game being free is a STEAL.

For the devs and new players, here are some of the glitches I've noticed:
- Immediately after closing your inventory or tool selection, you can walk left and right but not forward. This becomes a bit inconvenient when you've chopped down a tree and are trying to switch to your bow. 
- The game sometimes crashes or the server disconnects (occasionally this is just on my end due to unstable wifi). When this happens, the tutorials are occasionally reset. Turning off tutorials would solve this problem, however, as there is often new content to see/unlock, tutorials are helpful throughout the course of the playthrough (at least where I'm at 30 hours in). So I'd prefer to honestly just click through the tutorials again rather than turn them off, but now I've had to do this 3-4 times. This has happened to my mom as well.
- When closing the game, I have to force close it through Steam, which I've noticed when restarting it. It doesn't close despite clicking exit game. It doesn't show up on my hot bar, but steam still says that it's running. This might be an issue on Steams end.
- My fish/bug collection broke :(. You can add prize fish and bugs to your plot to display. I guess I added too many, and now only some of my display cases actually show the bug/fish. The rest show the checkered textureless pattern instead. I'm not sure which setting I'd need to turn on to fix that. My fish/bug display was my favourite part of my plot but now it's a bit of a graveyard with only some fish visible among their bretheren, 
- This is something that is honestly hard to run into so I doubt it will be an issue for most people: if you get kicked out of the game or it crashes outside of the housing plots, where you receive the welcome message from the developers, don't open your inventory. I triggered my inventory tutorial, which asked me to click on something on the screen, but the welcome message from the dev team popped up at the same time. I couldn't interact with either, so had to force shutdown the game. Great way to get stuck, but also a bit funny. Again, probably not likely to happen, but a fun bit of misfortune to share haha.

One last suggestion, but when I first started playing I didn't realise I'd be receiving mail from the villagers. Most games have mailboxes as a way to receive update newsletters and messages from the dev team. There's also just so much to check out the mail box was ignored for a bit too long. I know the tutorial mentions that Auni brings the mail every morning, but maybe mentioning in the tutorial that new mail will come in as your relationships with the villagers increases, or having checking the mailbox as a quest objective would help. I know my mom had the same issue where she was struggling with a quest because she didn't know to check the mail box. Now I check it all the time, I love the function! I really love the characters you can meet and interact with in this game. 

I might come back and review it again once I get farther into the quest lines. So far I'm enjoying it. My mom also plays and she's been enjoying it a lot. I think the characters and relationship developments are my favourite part of the game so far. I would definitely recommend trying this game.</p>

      <p>The mouse is not calibrated, and some buttons (particularly the X in the menu screen) are un-clickable, even taking into account the severe difference between my cursor and what the calibration says my cursor is at. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but unfortunately this is completely unplayable for me

I intend to try again after some more updates, hopefully it will get fixed by then</p>

      <p>Overall, I like it. It's really cute, and it has Dreamlight Valley vibes with a cute story. The only complaint so far is the pacing. Things take a loooong time. And with so much game play to explore, it feels like treading water sometimes. Also the day goes by rather fast, and fulfilling daily requests can get frustrating sometimes when it feels like you're running out of time. Then again, I'm still getting used to the game. We'll see if this all changes!</p>

      <p>Palia - A stunning island of limited and repetitive boredom ...

+ Graphics (Love it. Fits together. Made with heart.)
+ Animations (Very detailed and fluent animations)
+ Music (It's good)

- Yes, you can gift things to NPCs to build a relationship. But they are all weird, purple aliens. No thanks.
- Yes, you can buy customes in the shop, but 47,50 € for a custome is INSANE. No thanks.
- Yes, you can craft, but furniture and decoration in most cases has no other function. 
- Yes, you can build a house, but it has no functions other than beeing visited. 
- Yes, you can do super simple nobrainer quests that make you run around the map, while the NPCs move every second and you spend time searching them.
- Not much to discover in the open world. I was hoping for serious monster battles and class system, nothing.
- You can't swim. You will even drown in a small puddle. It's ridiculous.
- Yes, you can interact and play with other people, but the game design makes it completely unnecessary. Haven't seen any group ingame, even chatting is rare to see, because why would you?
- Too long waiting times for crafting: A piece of cloth takes about 8 minutes.
- Big clock icon covering the interface with "Morning, Day, Noon, Night", which is easy to see, but no mini-map? 

This game is likely better for kids, very simple in every aspect. Just to spend some time unlocking ways to decorate a house, not more.</p>

      <p>This game has helped me so much recently. After going through a toxic breakup, I started to realize how abusive and controlling the man I was with was. He took advantage of an abused woman and I just loaded the game up and just started to collect items. And boy did my mind calm down and just empty out. I have been playing this game every single day for a week at least now and it's helped me so much keep calm and clear my mind so I can focus on the important things. I would highly suggest this game for anyone. Anyone with anxiety, depression, and dealing with so much horrible things. It can help. So fun, calming and cozy... Though I will say one thing, I'm obsessed with crafting every single furnishing item in the game. Unlocking the rest of the set and then continue on to the next set. Heck I have so much added onto the grand harvest house that I'm not even done yet adding rooms. I'm beyond obsessed with building the most beautiful gorgeous home I can call my own while I find my real one with my kitty cats!</p>

      <p>Definitely a game designed for children and "cozy" people. This falls along the lines of a downgraded Minecraft in the sense that there is no combat whatsoever. Aside from that, it has all the same play style that are parallel to Minecraft. There are skills like Hunting and Fishing, but no potential hazards like Creepers, Spiders and such. That said, the crafting, cooking, and overall features of the game are fun. The focus is heavily based on building a "Community" and creating bonds with the NPC's and other like-minded players. Overall, thumbs up. While I wish there were currently additional options that appeal to those who enjoy a bit more adventure in their play-through, this is a shining example of a "hidden gem" game from a startup Studio. Nice work here, Singularity 6!</p>

it is calming, semi-reakistic in a VERY comfortable way, the farming if fun so far, and hunting deer with bow and arrow is quite fun.
the world looks very nice and original, i just love the design of the flowers and plants, and the houses look great, they just feel like home to me.
i honestly just hope that this game is going to retain these qualities</p>

      <p>The game is really well thought of. Me and my SO loves these types of games like Stardew, Outward, Lego Fortnite but in those games there's room to improve, or could be better stuff. Here in Palia, you can see the work they've done, listening to feedbacks and implementing quality of life stuffs. it makes the game more fun honestly. No weather system, no energy, no stamina, no mana, it's a chill game and there's lots to do. You won't get bored quickly. Also, I really like how they did customizations that you can place items diagonally. If you like a chill game, you should try this</p>

      <p>Honestly, this game is very chill. there is so much to do despite it only just starting out. If you like to grind, then this is the game for you. I have to be constantly farming and hunting to maintain a descent income and the interactions with the NPCs is very "real-world" since you have to build relationships with them.

Since the game is just starting out, there isn't much to the lore yet but I'm looking forward to what can be done with it.

I personally am enjoying this game a lot. Hope this helps anyone who is looking into playing it.</p>

      <p>This game is a merge of Sims, Fortnight, Stardew Valley and in MMO form. Whilst enjoyable, it is still in Beta with no end in sight and no ingame options to provide feedback regarding the numerous bugs and issues that pop up. Whilst you pay nothing for the game, which is graphically beautiful with a calm pace on quests and fulfilling daily farming/building upkeep, anything cosmetic you may wish to purchase is really spenny. Overall a family friendly, calming game.</p>

      <p>Game does not allow you to delete your character. Which is silly for a MMO game..  Game links it to your steam account.  if you want another character.  nope not happening.

      <p>I got this game 2 days ago on a whim and I haven't stopped playing- I don't like super overwhelming games and this games gives me so much control over everything so I can decide what I am focusing on at any point. 
It's a lovely little mix between games like botw, stardew valley, minecraft and other such things- Though personally I find the npcs in Palia to be much more in depth than in Stardew but that could just be because they are more animated. 
If you're looking for a game which is complex enough to hold your attention, but simple enough that you don't want to throw whatever console/pc you are using, this is the one, I love it so much</p>

If you love the animal crossing grind, this is the game. Collecting, cooking, crafting, gardening. I just love everything about this game. <3 It's rare that a cozy game with no combat comes around and I am so grateful! I don't need the stress!</p>

      <p>Although the game is a bit buggy sometimes (something the developers are consistently trying to fix) this game has everything you need in a cozy game. Real time crafting (which they have reduced the times on since I began to play - Thanks Guys!) NPC quests, dating quests, and continuous events to keep you busy. There is always something to do and somewhere to go. The community for this game is top tier and overall wholesome 99% of the time. Someone has always got you if you need help! I have loved this game since its first launch on Epic Games. They have come a long way, and as the game is still currently in beta I expect them to continue to do great things with this game :)</p>

      <p>Palia is an absolute joy to play! It feels like Disney Dreamlight Valley and Animal Crossing combined into one perfect game. The world is beautiful and full of things to explore, from crafting to farming. It’s both relaxing and rewarding, with just the right amount of challenge. Plus, the social features make it even more fun. If you love life-sim games, you’ll be addicted to Palia in no time!</p>

      <p>If you want a cozy game with grind, but not stab your eye out grind, then this is it. It's cute, it's fun and it's got a little romance. There is a lot of running back and forth and stuff like that. But it's fun and enjoyable!</p>

      <p>Very fun, very cozy. I'm playing with my wife and 5yo. Little one can't read very well but he still has fun running around collecting things and using the tools. We went on our first hunting trip today and it was a blast! But he keeps building tents on his property instead of doing the quest for a house.</p>

      <p>Wasn't certain at first, but this game get more interesting the more you play. Lots to discover via quests and simple travelling.
Crafting is interesting, only there is no way of getting rid of / selling unused items, either crafted or received as gifts (part of the quests and progress), so these clutter up your inventory or storage. That part seriously needs to be fixed.
Otherwise, it's a pretty interesting game.</p>

      <p>Another lovely addition to the cozy Stardew-esque farming sims that scratches all the itches. Farming, crafting, cooking, fishing, decorating... you name it, you got it. I love that it caters to both grindset and casual players, too. The community has been incredibly kind and supportive so far, which I highly appreciate. I usually avoid online games because they typically force me to join a party and go run some dungeon or raid in order to progress, and I'm just way to self-conscious of my own skills for that. This game, though, has been a lovely surprise. It's been so helpful to be able to just ask chat for advice or help when I need it instead of getting stuck and frustrated or turning to Google. Highly recommend on all fronts!</p>

      <p>My favorite game series has always been Rune Factory. I love those style games but haven't played one in a while. I was not expecting much from a free steam game, lets be honest, but I have been so impressed with the story, art style, crafting mechanics, farming mechanics. Truly a beautiful game. 

The only thing I would like to see is farm animal component for more reliable income, but that is minor.</p>

Love the games color and graphics, design your home, build up your skills (gardening, fishing, mining, hunting, furniture making, cooking etc.) and befriend fellow Palians. There is a main story line and I have found it to be fairly short but really enjoyable. I'm not yet level 10 in any professions so maybe that will open up a new quest.

I usually play games with the music off and music of my choice on, but this game's music is so relaxing and quite fitting. So far I love it and I've put a decent amount of time in. :)</p>

      <p>I like the game, but there are so many bugs that it's frustrating to not be able to play it.  I can't play it on my Switch because of the lag and glitches.  For example, I waste so much time and resources trying to catch animals for quests, but they keep glitching out of range, disappearing, etc.  I tried to play on my PC, but after the 0.182 patch, my controller and keyboard stopped working entirely.  I'm not an IT person, but this does not seem like it should be happening.  I know it's hard work.  Please fix the game so we can enjoy it!</p>

      <p>It's a wonderful, relaxed, game. It has so much to do, it keeps you busy and you never feel like youve run out of things to do. At the time of me writing this, I have played for 33 hours and I haven't even scratched the surface of the main story line. You can befriend and even romance the NPCs. You can farm, hunt, decorate, build, and even talk to other players in the world. It's a lovely game that has very quickly become one of my favorites. I don't think I'll get bored any time soon.</p>

      <p>I adore this cute little game. There are some bugs and glitches that occur that suck, but the content is fun and relatively easy to understand game play wise. It's fun to customize your home plot and find all of the interesting bugs and fish. I do wish the RNG was a little more fair about some of the rare and epic things as some of them are quite common and some of them basically never occur. I have a difficult time finding oysters to begin with and one of the achievements requires you to open them until you find the specific item required for the achievement. Oysters are a common spawn supposedly. That aside, I spent an obsessive amount of time already playing this game because it's very enjoyable despite the hiccups.</p>

      <p>The game does need some work but that's understandable considering it's at its early stages. I personally struggle finding the locations and constantly need to open it to know where i am going. It would be nice to have some sort of GPS where you can select where to go and have an arrow guide you. Something similar to what's already implemented for the quests. Other than that I really like the game so far! It's a nice cozy games that's the perfect mix of popular games such as Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and Sims. I love the aspect of open world with the opportunity to do quests and engage with NPCs!</p>

      <p>It's a tough market because there are already a lot of games that have the same gameplay, and progression. I don't want to over generalize the things that were done differently in this game, but I fail to see much variation from games like Paleo Pines and My Time in Portia when you have an open world where most of your time is spent running around rather than doing tasks and farming resources. 

I don't like having to wait 30 real minutes to have materials needed to progress finish crafting, as well as the rng aspect of how many resources you get from a node, or where the node spawns. Usually you bet on having the nodes in a consistent area but it's quite honestly random. Also with the servers joining and kicking you randomly, the nodes keep disipearing and respawning somewhere else instead of the same general area. Its kind of annoying to have the entire world lose collision and having to wait until I can fast travel home because I fell thru the map. Its really annoying that upgrades to your tools are not permanent. 
And you have to repair them using repair kits, which are cheaper than crafting them fresh, but honestly its an aspect of gameplay that slogs the game down with how tedious already resource gathering already is. 

Realistically, do you expect people to play the game until they are level 10 in all skills? That doesn't sound fun. A lot of these types of games aren't fun and quickly lose my interest because of it. It's like how clash of clans makes you weight longer and longer with each upgrade. The cost of resources and the time it takes to craft is genuinely some of the most annoying things ever. 

Having the fishing mechanic of Far Cry 5 is interesting especially since you still insist on having the Animal Crossing, wait 3 times before you snag a fish. Especially when you can time your snag so you dont have to wait 3 times in animal crossing. Fishing is boring. I hate it. I especially hate having to stop harvesting resources to go repair my tool. The fast travel is a joke. You either pay to travel, or have to wait for the free one which is 15-30 minutes with each use. It honestly seems arbitrary. Why make the player wait? Your gameplay is limited by time. You cannot progress time for it is on a server. You are forced to wait for specific windows to carry out tasks. Why add even more to that with the arbitrary wait time for crafting resources. It makes little sense. You lock the player in an animation for some, you have automatic crafting for others, you don't need fuel, resources are inconsistently spotted around the playing area. 

It convalutes a straight forward loop for no other reason to keep you playing for as long as possible. If you could go to designated areas to grind for the resources you need, the game would be easy. They need you to run around, deload and reload areas in order to respawn or despawn nodes in order to roll the dice that it spawns an iron node and hoping you get 4 ore instead of 3 or 2. It's obnoxious. Why even have the BOTW climb mechanic and paraglider? You can'y climb anything that isn't very specific terrain. 

Why even have a stamina meter for climbing if you can sprint indefinitely? 
Not a very ambitious title. Not the worst game in this genre. Not much incentive to play often. 
Adding daily rewards seems up their alley. They're pussy-footing around with what they intend to do.</p>

      <p>Really fun game that can be a bit grindy, so depending on how you feel about grind this may or may not be for you. The only critique I'd have is the cosmetics can be a bit pricey(for IRL money) but at the same time, none of the gameplay is stuck behind payment- just cosmetic stuff. Note that this game is in beta and there are still quite a bit of bugs and problems the game has.</p>

I love how you actually interact with cooking and gardening, you chop veggies, make seeds worms and fertilizer, keep upping levels and learning and harvesting new things, and on top of that the beautiful worlds and story immersion is spectacular. I love the mystery and feeling like I still have more to learn and know. To the creators, thank you, I know you put alot into this game and I appreciate you.

      <p>I have been playing this game long before it come onto steam. I easily have 400+ hrs in total at this point. I do genuinely enjoy this game, I enjoy just spending time in the world, chilling, building up my plot and chatting to people. But I really do wish there was more content! Things like more furniture pieces, starstones, and QoL isnt enough. The story / characters updates are absolutely great, but other than that. We have no growth or improvements to the current skills, or no new skills either. I would love a new area, husbandry, and better customisation. 

I have heard people say this a million times and I get the games free and the only way they make money is through cosmetics. But there are literally achievements for reaching lvl 10, 25 and 50 for skills. a lil cosmetic to celebrate you reaching that would go a longgggg way! The new nameplates are proof of that, you get a lil cosmetic based on the amount of votes your plots gets. Its small but a really nice thing to get!</p>

      <p>Palia has become one of my all time favorite games. There is so much to do and so much potential for what is yet to come. At the time of this writing, Palia is still in beta and not officially at a 1.0 release though they have mentioned it is coming.

Even though I have pretty much finished the storyline and NPC quests, there is still SO much to do. I garden, hunt, mine, bug hunt, fish, and more. I need to catch all the things to get accomplishments, trophies, and plushies! I still need to finish decorating my house and plot but I am usually so busy with other things. This is a game you can really get lost in.

It's so good and you literally can't beat free. Though if they ever do start charging for the game, it would absolutely be worth it. I hope it keeps getting developed for years to come and the cult following keeps building. The community is so loyal and very kind, open, and welcoming. I highly welcome joining Palia. Welcome home!</p>

      <p>Palia is a cozy life sim in a fantasy world with lively characters (yes they're dateable) and beautiful landscapes! It's part farming sim part mmo-rpg and I think it's great! Especially as a free game, I think it's worth trying out for any cozy gamer. The only downside is that the cosmetics in the game are very limited, the clothing options are very bland unless you want to spend real money, and in that case the outfits are typically between 15-25 dollars a piece. This is how the game makes money so if you think of like you're donating to a small developing team to continue the game then it's not as bad considering the game itself is free. Definitely recommend giving it a try!</p>

      <p>Great game and awesome community. Such an awesome set of players. The game is a lot of fun. The scenery is visually appealing. I love all the items you can pick up. Hunting is great. The respawn rate makes it so everyone has fun. The community is key with this game, and that also makes it worth playing.

My issues are the game crashes a lot. My character also freezes a lot, and I get stuck in scenery in a way that requires me to restart. The temples were excruciating to complete because of the amount of time I was restarting and traveling back to said location. My PC meets all the recommended requirements, and I understand there are a series of fixes to make the game work better. I've put in a lot of hours and tolerated much. I would like to play this game without the headache.</p>

      <p>BIG ol' thumbs down until they get the log in servers fixed so I can actually log in to the game.

At this point, I'm only able to get in about 1/3 of the times I try.

      <p>I played for several weeks straight around this time last year at the end of the closed beta and the start of the open beta. I stopped after completing all the content that was available at the time. When the latest update released, I had support reset my account so I could start over fresh and experience it all again a year later, hopefully with some improvements. I was not impressed.

The farming is and always has been terrible. It's a "puzzle" mini-game where you arrange your crops in certain nonsensical patterns to gain buffs. The optimal crop fields look ugly, and it's a chore to keep everything planted according to plan. Tilling soil and watering crops require an excessively long amount of time as well. The nine field limit is absurd.

The game is a live service multiplayer game that does not benefit from being live service or multiplayer. It is also still in beta, despite the store page not being tagged as early access. Small updates come out every month or two with a few features (and lots of bugs), and there have been a couple seasonal events. You can see other players running around the world on occasion, you can tour friends' houses, and friends can provide limited assistance with a select few activities. You cannot have a farm/house with a friend, and you cannot experience quests with a friend.

Most of the time spent playing the game will be grinding for materials while waiting for machines to process resources or for crops to grow. It's very tempting to just AFK while waiting at times if there are no quests to do. In addition to being limited to only nine farm fields, players are also limited to only a few processing machines. It takes about two hours of waiting (at least) to refine the materials needed to build the starter house. At least the house is built in thirty seconds now, instead of the twelve hours it took a year ago.

The premium shop is atrocious. Some cosmetics are $50, and nothing can be bought directly. You have to first exchange real money for in-game currency (which uses a predatory pricing scale like most other freemium games), usually getting more than you need for any given item you might want to purchase. Of course the idea is that you'll then buy even more to use up your "extra" money. I have not and will not spend a dollar on this game unless they get rid of this horrible system.

I don't expect this to be around very long. The developer gutted its staff earlier this year and then got bought by another company. Supposedly the first big update with a new map region is coming next year, and I'll be very surprised if it arrives in good shape, if at all.</p>

      <p>DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I installed this game to my computer this weekend. It is Tuesday. I have spent almost 2.5 days on this game as I write this. It is my second most played game on Steam and I haven't owned it a week. I have a family, I think, I don't know, the only family I know now are Badruu and Delaila. Instead of sleeping, I'm looking for green pearls because I need to level up my friendship with Tamala. This game tells you it's free -- that is a lie. Do not trust it. The cost is much larger than you can understand. I now comfort the bags growing under my eyes by assuring myself I just need to get ONE MORE level in mining before I go to bed at 7 in the morning.</p>

      <p>This is beautiful game, but devs are money lover.

Aggressively adding every update new many premium cosmetics, some are beautiful and some aren't my cup of tea.
Cheap cosmetic is cost 8.50 euro, nicer ones is cost around 25-30 euro. I bought one and wear it often. I'm not gonna pay another  30 euro for single cosmetic. Not worth it at all. I'd happy to pay for montly membership to wear everything.

Farming are limited- few of vegetables and fruits. Only 9x soils. No farming animals.

Crafting furniture/decoration is cool, but inventory is such mess. No organizing sort by category. No recycle unwanted items.

Fishing, digging, chopping are fun. 

Story? Adding few short stories after few months of waiting.

Bugs? Bugs everywhere. 

Vote house tour to get nice name tag? Haha, normal people like me got few votes. I gave up lol. Who on earth to give thousand votes on empty house? Hahaha streamers. Unfair.</p>

      <p>I was enjoying the game until I realized there is a storage cap, money cap, and limit to the amount of soil I can grow crops on. I thought it would be a 3D game similar to Stardew Valley, but I was wrong.

Your actions barely influence other players, but you can't modify the game to your liking.

It's a game disguised as a grinding game, that doesn't let you grind. I have no idea what kind of game this is trying to be, but I spent 21 hours discovering it's nothing I will enjoy playing going forward.

Glad I didn't spend any money in it.</p>

      <p>Its a great game, it has some wow and some sims vibes, but is quite unique. The story is interesting and its easy to get addicted.
The only problem I see is as the progress gets bigger, the gameplay kind of slow down, the quests are fewer and its sometimes a bit boring. Lets hope that it will progress in the future.</p>

      <p>Palia is my life now. 

Everything about it is so satisfying, the progression, minigames, socializing with NPC's, cooking, building and decorating, playing with friends.. down to the little details like watching your smelter make bars. 

It's everything I could have ever wanted in a game, I love it so much!! For a beta release, it's amazing how polished it feels!</p>

      <p>After 20 hours of game play I would not recommend this game. 
The main reason is I don't think this actually provides a different or better experience from any other survival game, and to be clear that is what this is. 
I have read some reviews and they have said this game has good underlying ideas, and I would agree if this was in closed alpha. It is not. This is in an open beta and I do not see that the underlying systems will change. 
I think the main problem is that the game does not know what it wants to be. Is it multi-player or single player? Is this meant to be a relaxed game or is this about grinding like a maniac?
What I also see is that the current payment model is not viable. There are many places to bring in microtransactions and going forward I expect those to come in.
I think that they need to do is a "No Man Sky", shut this whole thing down and start again.
I think that cooking is interesting, but it is a single moderately important system. Why has this not been applied to crafting or even gathering? If this is a multi-player game then it needs to be core to the gameplay and not tacked on at the end.</p>

      <p>I find there are some noticeable issues with the game.

1) No way to access settings in game.
2) No way to exit game without hitting the windows key and force closing.
3) Sound glitches out and will cut in an out frequently.
4) Rocks are invisible and you have to run into them to get the game to flash them into sight for a second to find out where they are.

I have not played for very long, but it was enough for me not to like it.</p>

      <p>I really like this game.  People are friendly.  It's very relaxing and  peaceful.  The pace of the game is what I choose it to be.  That being said, It's not perfect in a few ways for me.  First, you can only make 1 character as far as I can tell.  Second, lots of leveling that takes a lot of time.  You have to level to complete quests.  Quests seem to come faster than the leveling. Third, not a lot of help in game on how to proceed on certain quests. That is, you don't always get enough info.  Thank goodness for the internet and people who post helpful information.  None of these issues are deal breakers for me and I still enjoy playing the game.   The last thing people should know is that, for a free game, it can be costly if you want special clothing and skins for your character (and don't we all).  In comparison to other games I play that you have to buy in game money with real money (ESO, Fallout 76, etc), the prices seem a little high for what you get in this game.  So if you can resist the temptation you'll be fine.</p>

      <p>Palia is a hidden gem of a game that is overlooked far too much! I've held down around 600-700 hours of game time playing on Switch until I linked my steam account. I have played for about a year now. YES it is cross platform! My husband and I played together for a long time! Slowly, the theme became the inspiration for our wedding because I fell in love with it THAT much! The whole idea of the game is open-world, reminiscent of ACNH but more realistic and fairytale like. You have your home you build, furniture you craft, hunting, fishing, bug catching etc. BUT... Instead of battle, everyone comes together as a community to help each other out. This game has quite literally restored my faith in humanity, because everyone I've met online has been so sweet and helpful! If you have any questions, just ask in the chat. Always call out rare resources like Palium and Flow trees so others can have a chance to collect the loot too! Everyone gets an equal share. I can tell you that the developers are continually making upgrades all of the time to the game. I was sad when I finished all of the quests and friendships, but then, more got added! So many bugs were fixed, and anytime I've had a problem, I've just reached out to support and they fixed the problem with a positive attitude. HUGE HUGE thumbs up to one of my favorite games- ever. The game is free to play, but the costumes you buy with real currency are a bit pricy. I think it's well worth it if it's supporting the further development of an already amazing game. Well done! I can't wait to see what's next!</p>

      <p>Great gameplay for those that love side quests . Freedom to play at your own pace. Helpful community. In game skills consist of gardening, hunting, fishing, gathering, mining, bug catching in an open world. If you just like to play for a few hours and not have to fight through dungeons and bosses, this is worth a try.</p>

The game leans heavy to doing things in a group but not allowing you to be a group when it comes to pooling resources to make a place... Other than that its been very enjoyable so far.</p>

      <p>A game that lets you live your wildest dreams, such as earning a living by catching butterflies, being gifted a real estate for free or having friendly neighbours. 
Jokes aside I didn't expect to be so enthralled by a game that looks like it was advertised for kids. Turned out the house decorating system is great and I'm also dying to get to know the villagers' backstories (the emotional baggage will end me). The daily schedule of villagers gives the player the impression of a living village, with npcs having their duties and habits. There's also romance. <3 For those who get bored fast Palia has a bunch of minigames, including simple but fun temple puzzles, arcade, agility tests and a game of cards you play with other players. The community is friendly and very helpful. Overall 10/10 cozy game to relax after a long day of trying to earn for a house irl.</p>

      <p>Their monitization strategy is really bad. Call me cynical but there is no way this game isn't going downhill into a spiral of worsening monetisation in the future so what's the point of investing your time in it?
And even if it doesn't go that way, doesn't it feel kind of hard justifying the purchase of their overpriced cash shop? I'm not the target audience although I spent around 17 dollars. But I think retaining and gaining new customers would be easier if playing and spending money left a better taste in your mouth. The last update I saw was just "added new stuff to cash shop" amazing update and not really soul draining. 
I'm biased against f2p games and I'll just say it straight as a programmer that I pray that I never have to sell my soul working on such a graphically beautiful looking game only to know the management are greedy money lovers. No suprise they had to lay off most of the developers as I doubt their entire f2p strategy was great to begin with. Rant over.</p>

      <p>I absolutely love playing this game. Packed full of adventurous quests and tasks friendly and the not so friendly townsfolk,you meet many along the way and soon learn their likes and dislikes within different tasks requested of your character. As you progress further into game play you can upgrade your weapons,bow,arrows by crafting better ones and even repairing the basic models once you've learned the recipes to do so. Crafting,fishing,hunting,gardening,cooking,puzzle based quests,etc is some of the exciting activities here. Takes a bit of foraging and mining to get your character's skills to level up but it is well worth the wait once you receive the glider. There is much to discover along your journey in Palia but it is easy to lose time playing so bare that in mind when you consider getting this. This also has both in game and premium currency options so you can better the appearance and skills,equipment,etc of your game play.
Don't take my word for it though best to try it out for yourself to get your own experience. Can be played with friends or on your own but don't be too scared to ask for help when you require it for the more complicated tasks.</p>

      <p>It's definitely a vibe. If you get anxiety while stoned and need something to focus on until you come down, I *high*ly (lol) recommend this game. The wiki is a little... stark so far, but over time that will probably be fixed as more people add to it. Maybe the game devs will go add their two cents as well.</p>

      <p>I really, really wanted to like this one.  It's has a good premise, but bad execution.  It becomes empty, grindy, and boring right away.  Needs more things to do while you are waiting for timers.  Cosmetics and pets are locked behind a paywall, so nothing really to work for besides maybe your house.  This is a game for people who play for one hour a day.  Not my cup of tea.</p>

      <p>Firstly I have to mention that this game is still new and needs a bit of polishing. That being said, I'm still having a lot of fun with Palia, especially when playing with friends. It's a chill life simulator and I hope they keep it that way.

What I like:
- No hostile mobs.
- Fishing/hunting/cooking mechanics.
- Party buffs.
- Animations.
- Storage system. No need to run to 8 different chests to find something.
- How 'alive' the world is (not talking about multiplayer). We can randomly pick up a quest item and that feels more organic.
- House editing. The top-down view is very convenient and I like how we can customise our house layout. Wish the fireplace didn't take up an entire wall though. Also hope we are able to stack rooms in the future since we have a 2nd floor with that bigger Harvest house.
- Art style.
- Dialogue and characters are well written.

What I hope improves:
- Farming is quite slow, hope we get some upgrades that let us automate it a bit.
- Storage needs more filters, especially for our furniture.
- More interactions with villagers!
- More Community function. Maybe a community chest that we can all use to share items.

Issues: (some might just be a "my laptop" issue)
- Lighting glitches out sometimes when the time of day changes.
- Animals glitch out when multiple appear out of a tree at the same time.
- I crash almost 80% of the time when I first boot up the game. After that it runs smoothly.
- Bugs (insects) sometimes clip under the floor. (not talking about them despawning)
- Desync issues (animals/players) especially when in a party.
- Hair colour bug. (primary and secondary swap places and primary doesn't show up)
- World not loading in randomly. (ground to the mines disappears. when I enter a room, all the furniture goes into the void)
- Chat box flickering randomly.
- Texture bugs. (I see large square sand textures on the floor instead of grass. Icons having a green/red square around it.)</p>

      <p>I actually recommended this game to someone IRL earlier this week. Maybe this is harsh but as a game that has and gives such a feel good vibes, I am no longer happy to bring folks here. I am actually deeply disappointed with the ending of one of the main quest missions called "Keeper of the Roots". 
Yes, I basically fell in love with this hardened sweetheart just to be ejected from the temple and never allowed back in to see him. I genuinely don't even care if Gardener is never given any actual or new dialogue. I was willing to accept that reality. 
Now maybe this is just a bug or Singularity 6 expands on his story and overall character later on. This is why I'm more than open to feedback because until I hear or find something in the forums on this I really won't be coming back to play this further. I'm unreasonably sad about this, I'm well aware.

Otherwise I was so in love with this game as well. Something about it makes me feel truly immersed in a way many enjoyable games still can't make me. The characters range from unique and quirky to kinda cliche but still super enjoyable. This place is full of hot gossip if you're anything like me and are all about it. I love this game, truly. But that moment went i swung my pickaxe and the wall no longer came down really felt like I was not being loved back in the same way lmao</p>

      <p>Cant do quests togheter, Cant build a house togheter, even if you make a Guild or in this game's case a Community you cant get a Community house to build that togheter it really destroys the whole point of the game i wanted to enjoy this game togheter but you litterly cant even if you go to the other persons home and you get Editor rights you still are not allowed to place furniture you brought yourself. Neither can you gift them with like any form of trade system not even in the other persons chest because the game no matter where you are will only show your inventory or your chest even with multiple chests you still only get 1 inventory space although having more chests allows you to put more into it. this game is about giving gifts and doing stuff togheter while you litterly cant. 0/10 Do not recommend if you want to play this game togheter. Solo players only is what this game is designed for. i also find it stupid that any form of looking different is locked behind a paywall so yes real money no way to earn yourself a different look apperently. 

Finding out that i couldnt place furniture i brought with to my gf house even though i have editor rights was the last nail in the coffin for me with this game.</p>

      <p>This is the most casual game I've ever played. It's absolutely perfect to relax with after a long day. Play alone or with friends, fun either way. It's got the charm of Valheim, the gameplay of Stardew Valley, and the look of Fortnite. The story/lore is cool too.</p>

      <p>Okay, so this is kinda a "hot take". This game is free to play. This game also is good for what you get in the free to play model, it's great for people who don't have a ton of time to invest in a game (casual play). It also is fun within reasonable boundaries. I do not regret the 16 hours I've played the game.

What I don't like about the game is there are only 2 zones, and the cost for "cosmetic" skins. 

If I compare to other games that are free to play models, this game almost feels like a "cash grab". 

After playing for 16 hours just off and on, I feel the game is really small, no real endgame except for building up your plot and cosmetics. I'm really torn as the game is fun for casual play, but I can't say I would recommend it to anyone because of the cosmetics. If you want a game to unwind with after work for 15 mins at a time this game is for you and is great! If you want more play something else. And also no matter the game, don't spend real world currency on imaginary clothes and weapons.</p>

The very positive review rating is crazy. PPl love paying for things i guess. Consumers are idiots. They didnt even push for this new biome thats coming until ppl started to really complain.

      <p>Use to be positive. They did a winter update and the game stopped working for over 1000+ people, I got to the spring update before mine stopped working. No error message nor sounds just would not load. After troubleshooting myself for 1 week contacted support and their response except for a few troubleshooting steps was uninstall/reinstall graphics drivers 5X! I've been tech support for 10 yrs if it doesn't' fix it the first 1 or 2 time then its not going to FIX IT! Then they fired a bunch of their employees, not a smart move. They still had bugs/issues before the updates went thru which was never fixed and later caused further issues to escalate after updates.  But they keep making cosmetic 'stuff' that you can buy! Just what we want, NOT. And before I get the 'it's a beta' quote, it's not a beta game when they REMOVE all notification/documents legally saying that! They are treating the game like an alpha.

There is a steam page: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2707930/discussions/0/4360123382467518002/?tscn=1721832087 which is documenting others who have posted on this issue.</p>

      <p>The game is so cozy and fun -- a tad frustrating at times, but they do tend to fix some of the quests that are too hard/require too much grinding. (If you love fishing, this is the game for you!) I do like having other folks in the world with me to help out/hang out with while playing. The NPC characters are great too :D</p>

      <p>First time experiencing a cozy game and making a review considering how many games played.  I am very pleased! The quality of the game is amazing since it is free to play and in Beta. This game ticks many boxes, crafting, housing/decoration, questing, engaging characters, exploration, fun mechanics, lovely community, and visual appeal all with no pressure. I have seen comments about the cash shop items cost and yes they are little steep but they have to make money to keep evolving. It appears the Devs are dedicated in the future of the game. I hope this game continues forward as I so enjoy playing.</p>

      <p>If you can get over the tumblr-esque character design the game is pretty comfy and fun for being 'Beta'. However once you've caught up on quests you've pretty much hit the end of content. I liked the few hours I played but I don't anticipate it being worth playing more just to have more timegated crafts.

This game won't likely get off the ground also as most of the dev team has been let go/axed prior to the game getting out of Beta.

Just try it out and experience it but be prepared to drop it after 10-15 hours.</p>

You can interact and party up with others or you can fully play the game and achieve your goals on your own. There is a request feature that allows you to add up to 4 requests per day where others in the game can send you resources. There are lots of aspects of this game that are fun! You can eventually access the underground market and play card games and win gold or other cool in game items. You can obtain in game trophies that you can hang in your home. There are just too many ways to enjoy this game. From farming to decorating to resource gathering. I highly recommend!</p>

      <p>I like that you have quests driven story line and that you can decorate and build to your hearts content. Two of my favorite childhood games were the Sims and Harvest Moon and this is the in between. The only thing I would change is having an unlimited placement for flowers and building blocks. I appreciate the buildings you can pay for to make your home, but I wanted to play with the blocks and build something unique and about halfway through, it told me I reached the building block limit. Really fun game though!</p>

It has hunting, farming, cooking, mining, relationship building, fishing, bug catching, everything you want from a cozy game.

From the moment I stepped into the world, I was captivated by its charm and warmth. The freedom to explore, craft, and build at my own pace is incredibly liberating. The community aspect is fantastic – I have yet to explore fully as currently have been playing solo mostly to get to grips with everything.

The developers have done an excellent job of creating a world that feels alive and welcoming. The characters are well-developed, and their stories add a layer of depth that keeps me coming back for more. The multiplayer features are seamlessly integrated, making it easy to team up with friends for activities like fishing or hunting if required.

Overall, Palia is a game that offers a perfect blend of relaxation and engagement. It’s a wonderful escape from reality, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a chilled, community-driven MMO experience.  I can also play it with my daughters who love it and help me decorate my house! :)</p>

      <p>Really fun so far. Wish they would add teleport way points though. The constant running around the huge map is not that much fun when I'm in a hurry.</p>

      <p>Very cute and chill game. You get free plot to build a home, make friends with npcs, with other players, complete quests, make stuff, etc. Highly recommended. Mac people can play too if they use an emulator. I use Geforce Now.</p>

      <p>great game! By no means is it a perfect game yet there are still some bugs here and there but it's so addicting!! 

My only tip if do not grind out all the quests cause you will get bored of the game quickly once you're done waiting for new updates.</p>

      <p>I'm absolutely loving this game's cosy fantasy vibes with a hint of a darker story hidden within the NPC dialogue, environmental storytelling and notes you can find around the world, and have had a blast running around and exploring all the nooks and crannies in the map. The house decoration system is also pretty easy to use once you learn the buttons and I love the efforts the developers have put in to encourage collaboration between players by making resources shareable among all who participate in gathering them. The characters and dialogue options are also really detailed and I'm having a heap of fun getting to know all the interesting characters. I've had a couple of minor bugs like visual glitches or getting stuck clipped through a wall, but nothing too bad and the game is both free and still in beta development. Highly recommend giving it a go if you enjoy exploring magical worlds, finding hidden secrets and piecing together stories from dialogue and environmental clues, or if you just want to relax and build a cute cottage and romance some fun NPCs.</p>

      <p>This game takes all the best aspects of chill farming sims & MMORPGs & combines them together into a very adorable & charming game. There's in depth lore for each NPC & so much story for the whole game! Everynone is charming in their own way, & I love the friendship/romance system. I absolutely love this game & simply cannot get enough of it. I played off their personal launcher for probably 1k hours before getting it on steam for convenience. 
Whether you play solo or with friends, it's a great experience. You can easily team up with random ppl in the servers, everyone is usually really polite & helpful, Or you can play with your friends! You can team up to do just about everything: hunting, mining, fishing, bug catching, ect. The games allows cohesive teamwork!
The Dev's are completely awesome & really listen to the community. & The discord is always humming with news & updates. It's pretty easy to find friends in this game! <3 <3 <3 
-11/10 Would Recommend!</p>

You're free to just wander around and gather materials and craft, but quests help alot with learning new recipes. All in all, it's fun and I'll be back for sure.</p>

Really enjoyable for the gameplay and designs.

It's astonishing that they avoided the paid content to revolve around skipping or buffing the gameplay. The only real money shop is for cosmetics, as it should be !!

      <p>About 40 hours in and I am loving this game. It's so casual and just easy to play. It doesn't feel like a grind or boring because I can choose what to do at anytime. Looking forward to having more recipes unlocked and then start trying to build a cool property, but for now I'm just trying to level and do as many quests as I can. Also like having the collections of things to try and find/get. And for free? No reason to not at least give it a try!</p>

      <p>Palia is a stirring blend of charm and exploration. Its vibrant world (Pro) teems with life and wonder, stirring a childlike awe within me. The sense of community and companionship (Pro) evokes feelings of warmth and belonging. Yet, the game lacks in narrative depth (Con), leaving me yearning for a richer backstory. The customization options (Pro) are delightful but the repetitive tasks (Con) dampen the excitement over time. Nevertheless, Palia's enchanting environment and engaging social interactions offer a unique emotional experience. I recommend it for those seeking an immersive, community-driven journey.‍</p>

However, I really wish they would focus on fixing the bugs (ex. i'm still having a hard time CLIMBING walls without bugging out. This has been a problem since i started playing almost a year ago) and adding more things to do in general instead of pumping out more premium cash shop garbage.</p>

      <p>I want to start this review by mentioning this game is in BETA! I feel many of the negative reviews currently circulating are complaints about lack of content, things to do etc. I don't understand these reviews. I am at 47 hrs at this point, almost reached lvl 10 in most skills, grinding for the higher level missions and I can honestly say I am not bored or have I ever been bored in Palia.

There are a few things that annoy me:
1. Not many building blocks (I like to build unique things but there are plenty of prefabs)
2. Missions got higher requirements quickly which stopped me in my tracks.
3. There are some annoying glitches around climbing.
4. I want to swim :'(

BUTTTT....

This is a beta 0.182 release and from what I've heard from previous releases they've already improved cooperation and some features from previous versions showing that this developer does actually listen to its community.

I am very much looking forward to where this game goes next and I'm very much excited to be part of its development roadmap.</p>

      <p>Niestety, nie mogę pisać recenzji w języku niemieckim, ale mogę podać recenzję Palia w języku angielskim.

Palia, ah, świeży powiew zaskakująco nie-pixelowanego powietrza. Pro: grafika jest tak ostra, że mogłaby przeciąć chleb. Kontra: fabuła jest tak płytką, że kaczka mógłaby po niej przejść. Pro: swoboda tworzenia swojego domu jest jak Minecraft dla dorosłych. Kontra: napotkane postacie są tak płaskie, że mogłyby być 2D. Pro: rośliny są bardziej realistyczne niż moj związek. Kontra: rozmowy z NPC są mniej emocjonujące niż moje rozmowy z roślinami. 

Rekomendacja: jeżeli lubisz piękne widoki i budowanie, to będzie to gra dla ciebie. Jeżeli szukasz głębokiej fabuły, to... nie. Palia to jak randka z supermodelką, która czyta tylko książki kolorowanki. Piękna, ale... pusta.‍</p>

      <p>Great game with a great concept. I enjoy the fact that this MMO doesn't have classes and fighting (unless you count hunting wildlife). This is the first time I've seen an online game allow you to date and romance NPCs. I also like that it isn't gender locked. Loving the NPCs rotating their daily schedules and doing various activities. I like that you can communicate with NPCs even if they are behind a locked door. The game's community seems peaceful. No competition or bullying. People mind their business and play. Items spawn quick enough for everyone to obtain resources. Loot is nicely distributed. No pressure to purchase premium, but you are informed about it if you wish to purchase. Overall the game does not feel limited and I never feel restricted behind a paywall. Works on a low end machine like mine on very low graphics. If I want high end graphics I just switch to my Nintendo Switch (I love how I can pick up and play on supporting devices and maintain my character just by linking). Game requires updated drivers or else Unreal Engine will crash. If I think of anything else I'll update. Not sure which NPC I'll romance, but probably Najuma's dad. :D</p>

      <p>Honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this game so much. 

The world is beautiful, quests are fun and doesn't seem repetitive even though they are at times. The villagers are well made and each has their own uniqueness.

Community is super helpful and friendly. You can play solo if you want, but at some point you'll need someone to help you chop down a flow tree, but besides that you literally don't have to interact with other players. 

There's no danger aspects, no negative consequences at all - which makes it extremely non stressful. 

I do wish there was more decor items and color switches, more wall lamps and more crops to grow (berries and fruit mainly), and more bushes/hedges to decorate with at your plot. Also wish the female body type was a bit more feminine, bigger boobs, wider hips and less flat ass. More hairstyles would also be welcome.</p>

      <p>This is a great game! One of the things I enjoy most is customizing my homestead and this game emphasizes that! But the story quests is very enjoyable as well and the skill mini games aren't overly difficult. The MMO community is great as well with the option to reach out to your fellow human neighbor to ask for a cup of sugar (or other commodities).</p>

      <p>Fun, free time waster. Plenty to do and learn. Looks pretty and charming. Relationship building also. Lots of running about until you get a glider then you can run about after gliding. Lots of cosmetics available if you want of support the game financially, no obligation. Farming, collecting, exploration. Can party with other people or solo like myself.

EDIT: After 80 hours in it is a compelling play. The game goes deeper than simply farming. Probably suitable for young teens onwards. There is still plenty to do.</p>

      <p>Funny cozy game that gets build up on the way, really nice to play alone or with friends. Game can be a bit basic but seeing how it's getting expanded quickly it's enough for me personally to keep me in the gameplay loop. Only gripe is not being able to create/unlock clothes (yet?) outside the premium market but given this is f2p I do understand they want to generate income to expand the game etc. The building plot is great but can use some more items to put down in a total on your plot. NPC's are okay, I hope they add more. Same goes for the skills. Really looking forward for what they are gonna add to the game. 7/10</p>

      <p>A great cozy game filled with puzzles and farming sims mechanics. You build your house, meet and date NPCs, and learn the different trades that exist. Bonus that this is a MMO that lets you do it all together (your friends can even help you design your house) though it works very well as a solo trek and I personally don't interact with people outside of "underground" soup games.
I do NOT recommend if you are look for something with action and high stakes, the whole point is literally living in a small village and building a life there, with equally cozy fantasy elements. None of the game mechanics are locked behind paywalls and there is no pay to win (I also don't think there is a win at all lol). Additionally there is great variety of in game outfits and hairs, but a lot of the most interest skins and costumes are pay to own.
More than anything we are still pretty early in the game's run so, while it's pretty robust already, I look forward to seeing what more it will have to offer. My kingdom for them to implement mounts.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy this game. Its one of those games that you can get lost in after a while. I have really enjoyed the story line and leveling up the different skills. My favorite part has to be the relationships you get to have with the townspeople. Cant wait to see where this game goes.</p>

      <p>[h3] F2P MMO [/h3]
Palia's open world feels like an MMO-version of [i][b]Genshin Impact[/b][/i] - where anyone can join in on fishing, mining, foraging or hunting adventures. There is also a nod to [i][b]Stardew Valley[/b][/i], with a focus on community and NPC relationships.

The story is unique so far, and the decorating system is a strong highlight, offering tons of customisation options that make every home feel truly personal.

On the downside, while the open world feels reminiscent of [i][b]Genshin[/b][/i], it can feel a bit clunky, though it's still in open beta. The graphics have a [i][b]Fortnite[/b][/i] vibe (personal opinion) - not a deal breaker, but something to note.

Overall, it's a cozy and promising game with plenty of charm.</p>

      <p>The coziest game I've played in a long time. Tons of furniture items and customization for your plot. The only thing that would make it better is some form of light combat/dungeoneering, and some way to unlock skins for your tools and clothes for your character besides the cash shop. Maybe some farm animals... and mounts? It just needs a way to retain players for longer than a few weeks. if they added that I don't think I'd ever stop playing. 8/10 all day.</p>

      <p>I like the game. I think it's cute and relaxing when it's not being repetitive. There's just a lot of back and forth with only one fast travel (to your home) while spending forever mining. I think if I didn't have a time restraint on games (b/c of kids, husband, sports, etc) I'd invest more time into it but I just can't when there are other, more diverse games out there. If your single, or a teen, or don't have to worry about any of the above I'd highly recommend this game.</p>

I've spent hundreds of hours in palia, not reflected on my steam account because most of my gameplay was on the switch. I haven't played much lately but I will say for awhile this was the cozy refuge I needed, and I know i'll return. (I know I'm going to have serious FOMO when I find out how many plushies I missed out on)</p>

      <p>So around 38 Hours in now and it flew by in a good way, feels like a great animated movie that ends before you are ready for it too; it's so good you just want more.

Had many wholesome interactions in game, one where I think I got a guy to smile when I was sitting on a dock at night just going. "I'm just waiting for sunrise." I just wanted to see it lol.

So far no horror elements to give me a heart attack so having a very nice time playing this game so far.

I can honestly say, I will most likely spend money on this game to support it one day in the near future. (Yeah yeah I also rly want some of those outfits XD)

Seriously though, if you have read this far please, please give this game a chance; it takes the good things I've seen in many games before and just yeets the bad stuff right out the window... Honestly the only complains I really have are things that'll probably be fixed ones it's out of Beta.
- Landscapes vanishing.
- Character freaking the F out when trying to climb stuff.
- Having to relaunch the entire game cause things stop working.

But most importantly... Water = no happy swim-swim :,( , such a lame detail but how I wish swimming will be added, Imagine just laying on ur back in the water. no reason other then just pure Zen XD</p>

      <p>The perfect combination for such a game. Building your plot, relationships with NPC's, magic and an interesting story. Yes, it does have some gliches but you find a solution if u search the web or just press "Unstuck". It is time consuming but only because it has so many quests and you can easily find yourself getting in depth of this game. Overall I incourage everyone to try this game because its very fortunate to find it entertaining.</p>

      <p>Palia is the latest addition to my gaming rotation, and it’s a total gem. If you’re a fan of cozy, laid-back games, this one’s right up your alley.

 Palia feels like a mashup of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing but with an MMO twist. And before you go, “Oh no, another multiplayer game,” hear me out—it’s super relaxed and really focuses on community and creativity.

The game is set in this beautiful, serene world where you can farm, fish, craft, and decorate to your heart’s content. The art style is adorable, with soft colors and charming designs that make the whole experience feel like a warm, fuzzy blanket. The character customization options are fantastic too, so you can create a character that really reflects your personal style.

One of the best parts? The gameplay is all about taking it easy. There’s no grinding for levels or racing against the clock—just a bunch of chill activities you can enjoy at your own pace. You can build your own little paradise, make friends with other players, and get to know the quirky NPCs in the game. It’s like having your own slice of paradise without any of the stress.

The crafting system is especially satisfying. Whether you’re whipping up new recipes or decorating your home, it’s so rewarding to see your creations come to life. Plus, the community is really friendly, so it’s easy to connect and hang out with others who are just there for the good vibes.

In a nutshell, Palia is perfect for anyone who needs a break from high-stakes gaming and wants a more relaxing, creative experience. If you’re into games that let you unwind and build something beautiful, you should definitely give Palia a try!</p>

      <p>Please read this review with the understanding that this is a ~*~f r e e  B E T A~*~ game.

Pros:
- Base game is free, only paid content is aesthetic, so there's no pay to win.
- Game is based around community and generally has a very positive and supportive player base. Everyone I've encountered has been helpful save for 1 or 2. You'll have that in every game, but this game seems to have fewer trolls/griefers than others.
- Game is relatively easy to get the hang of while remaining challenging. Basic mechanics are easy to understand, but you'll still need skill and practice to catch/hunt some more rare creatures
- So far, there are consistent updates and devs seem quite transparent about their intentions. Updates seems based on user feedback, which I'm pretty happy to see
- Characters are relatively diverse and different enough from each other. Also... kinda love that not EVERYONE has a tragic backstory. I love that we have romanceable characters who are just "I just wanna be a farmer" even if that's not my cup of tea.
- Story is super promising! It had me immediately intrigued and locked in

Cons:
- Paid content seems a bit on the pricey side; I'd love for paid content to remain aesthetic only, but at a lower cost. I'd pay for base game and then have cheaper paid cosmetics, if that makes sense. Or perhaps ways to accumulate small amounts of premium currency, like rare achievements or something?
- There are only 2 adventure zones at the moment--they are pretty fleshed out, and this is still a Beta game, so this isn't too much of a problem (A 3rd zone is being released early next year apparently!)
- This was addressed in a recent post by dev, but I'll reiterate it--increase decor limit!
- I'd love to see more random treasure chests too. I love collecting them. (Not really a con, I just want hundreds of those cute little chests) Let me keep the chest from the waterlogged chest please!!!
- There are some characters I'd love to see more depth of. For instance, more story with Jina, Hekla, Elouisa, Einar, etc. I'm sure there are plans for more characters in new zones/future updates, so again this isn't really a problem too much
- I WANNA GO SEE THE CITY AND SEE MORE GRIMALKIN.
- The STORY!! Con is just that this isn't a finished game and I CRAVE MORE. GIMME.</p>

      <p>This is one heck of a cozy game!  It definitely draws heavily from other mellow games. I really think they did a  great job of making all of the professions interesting and the villager story lines are cute.</p>

      <p>It's a fun and chill game with a surprising amount to accomplish. I stopped playing for a few months (I was on their own launcher originally and only just recently switched to Steam, and in the time I was away they added a bunch of cool stuff.

There is one major flaw, which is the fishing. The rarity distribution is INFURIATING. There is a significant difference between something being rare enough to be a fun challenge, and so rare that it drives people to quit the game entirely. Spending hours a day for a week fishing constantly for one specific fish and not getting it errs far too much on the latter side.</p>

      <p>This game is very cozy and relaxing the majority of the time just you working your way up to enhance your skills: farming, building, crafting, fishing, etc. There is zero combat (unless you consider hunting is one). There are some quests that will definitely makes you think to solve them. A lot of people don't like this game due to the fact that there is a cosmetic store, but let's be honest, the game is free itself so the developer just trying to find a simple way to earn something back, and it is solely up to your decision to get those items or not, they are not required to enhance the gaming experience. One thing I really love about this game is the NPCs, they don't just stand still in one spot, they move around just like other players and you have to actively look for them through the map and the compass, which is very realistic in my opinion.</p>

      <p>Palia is such a well rounded cozy game! Great player housing and character stories. Great systems all around.  There's some little glitches here and there, but it's still being developed. If you loved My Time at Portia, and My Time at Sandrock, you'll love this.</p>

      <p>Palia is a beautiful, cosy and full game with lots to do, whether resource gathering or decorating. The lore and storylines have great depth to them. I've been playing since December 2023, i started out on the switch. I love Palia and i play very regularly. of course there are plenty of bugs as it is open beta. i would like to see the devs more focused on optimising the game for all platforms and bringing a new adventure zone as this would not only bring a lot of older players back but also add majority of what we are all asking for :)</p>

Super cozy and chilled, lots of dialogue with the villagers, love being ale to romance 2 villagers at once, plenty of craftables and different furniture types.
Of course it has some grindy items but all these games do!
Can't wait to see what they come up with next!</p>

      <p>I would recommend this game if you like games like Stardew... with a big BUT. 
I enjoy the farming and customizing my plot, farming, hunting, and fishing. However the story is unfinished and I'm just stuck in this farming/gathering and customizing loop with not much else to do, the devs seem to be able to drop new cosmetics bundles all the time but nothing for the actual story. The mechanics are rather laggy and glitchy at times, you can NOT change your character name at ALL or have more than one character, and lord help you if you're playing on Switch... I liked how everything I did on PC was seamlessly accessible on my Switch, but the actual mechanics are very annoying and makes it almost unplayable on that platform.
Overall I can't deny that I have sunk almost 200 hours into this game, and I do like to play it on PC to zone out and relax BUT I would really like to see a finished story and the glitches addressed VS another pricey cosmetics pack drop... and maybe a better fast-travel system... Fingers crossed for the future, this could be a really great game with some attention to the right places.</p>

      <p>I debated playing this game for awhile it seemed too similar to Dreamlight Valley. Boy was I wrong it's better. I picked it up and have found it hard to put back down. I don't really have any complaints honestly. I am hoping to see more options for character making but I am VERY happy with the game so far. I am excited to see where this game goes in the future. If you are like I was and am debating on playing, TRY IT. Just try it!!</p>

      <p>Its a cute game that reminds me of Stardew Valley and My Time At Sandrock smashed into a mini MMO. It is VERY player friendly, has a few little movement bugs and UI bugs, but I'm sure those will get ironed out. My only warning (NOT a negative persay) is that the game is a bit grindy. Like....juuuust on this side of mobile game grindy. BUT, that being said....it is absolutley NOT a pay to win game. There is zero way to get an advantage buy spending real money. You have to earn your way up by asking for help from, and offering help to, other players. All in all a solid 9/10. Will continue playing and will recommend to friends and others.</p>

      <p>I love the simplicity of the game, no action bars with spells left right and centre. A useful but straightforward crafting system. Skills to level and expand as you progress. I like how different the idea of progression is here. Level is based around all your skill levels, game progression based around your relation ship with the locals. Your own plot to expand and develop as you please. The world map isnt too big but large enough to get lost in, without any pressure to speed up your travel via mounts (although point to point travel is available). There is lots to enjoy here that very very quickly gets bypassed in other open world games.</p>

      <p>Cannot believe this is free and the only microtransactions are some skins and pets that I honestly totally forget about. The dialogue and writing could use some work, but the quests for the most part are interesting. There are so many things to do and I really enjoy the hunting mechanic. 

The farm customization is amazing. There is a grid, but you can rotate items more than just flipping them ninty degrees, place things on top of each other, etc. There are even building blocks that don't follow 100% normal physics so that you can make interesting structures.

I find inventory and chest space is too limited given the number of items and uses in the game, but i guess that does make it more of a challenge. You can't hoard a stack of every item like you might in other games like Stardew Valley. 

I think this is better than Disney Dreamlight Valley. More mechanics, larger map, etc.</p>

      <p>I like this game! I'm having fun so far.

Some recommendation:

-Craftable clothes/armors
-Different weapons for hunting e.g spears, swords, etc.
-Bigger fish to catch! <3
-mounts preferably some animals that you can hunt in the wild.
-Wild Animal taming system 
-Breeding system
-Able to sell animals
-Rare animals (Make wild animals with stars too). Some of us just love seeing them on displays.
-Craftable gliders
-Dungeons with monsters if you can't add monsters that drop loots, you can add aggressive animals like wolves, tigers, etc. This will be a fun addition for people who always play in coop. (Like me)
-More books that we can store on the bookshelf. (Add reading while sitting on a chair, ground, etc animation)
-Swimming animation. Just put an invisible barriers on the areas where the players shouldn't be able to get to.
-Musical instruments and playing musical instruments system. Sometimes it's cool to be able to just play music while just chatting with friends.
-second floor house upgrade.
-sleeping system (No need to put fast forward time system. Just let the characters be able to use the bed)
-sleeping animation
-Trading system. Allow players to set up shop/stall on the main town or anywhere. This will make collecting rare materials worth it.
-Marriage system (You can create a shared plots)
-Church where you can get married.
-guild system. Allows players to create factions that focuses on one area.
-guild office/house. A shared plot where the guild officers can develop and guild members to hang out.
-hunting events / dungeon raid events

This game has so much potential than one can realize. Thank you for creating this masterpiece.</p>

      <p>Bear in mind that this is extremely EA still, but it has a lot of potential once it's done to be a fun and relaxing multiplayer game. It has a cosmetic cash shop but that's all so far. It's a cute, chill game with puzzles, platforming and a bit of exploration. The wiki mentions many zones that're discussed within the game and I hope to see them become a reality.</p>

      <p>This is seriously such a fun game! I have honestly never met a nicer in game community anywhere, I have yet to see a rude word spoken, everyone is so helpful and nice. There is no lack of stuff to do, from farming, crafting, building, hunting, mining, gathering, relationship building, questing, etc. There is no battle/survival aspect to this game, so if you're into that then this isn't the game for you. I picked this game up 3 days ago and haven't stopped since, it's a no brainer for me :)</p>

It's free, but feels like a AAA game!

      <p>While still in Beta, it plays like a full game already. It has a diverse cast of characters that are refreshing in their range of personalities & dispositions. The story provided has depth & takes time to fully uncover. Outside of the story, the game has as much to offer as you're willing to put into it. Perfect game for simulating a simple life, working together or alone, making friends via the online chat feature, designing home plots, & sharing your creativity with others. Thus far, the community fostered in this game is very uplifting & friendly. Highly recommend, am happy to support, & am excited to see this game grow.</p>

      <p>I've been playing Palia lately, and it's quickly become one of my favorite games. The serene atmosphere, with its beautiful landscapes and calming soundtrack, makes for a chill and relaxing experience.

I love the emphasis on community and cooperation, which feels natural and engaging. Whether I'm farming, crafting, or exploring, there's always something enjoyable to do without feeling overwhelmed.

Palia is the perfect escape from everyday life, offering a peaceful and immersive world that's great for unwinding.</p>

      <p>It's like if runescape and Stardew valley had a baby, but the baby inherited no combat. I'm still early here, but this game is like "everything is pretty and there's lots to explore, do, and build, and you can't die." Like if you jump off a really high cliff, you just somersault at the bottom. It's so wholesome. Perfect game for the weary of gore and violence and jump scares and scary creatures trying to get you. There is a hunting component, but it has no blood - the animal's "body" to loot just magically turns into a loot pouch instead of a carcass. I love this game so far !! It's so... gentle?</p>

      <p>Super fun game. If you like Stardew Valley, Harvest Moon, or Animal Crossing, most likely you will enjoy Palia

Pros:
Lots of fun things to do
Unique dialog with NPCs
Dating multiple NPCs
Lots of challenges to earn achievements/in-game rewards

Cons:
All of the cool cosmetics are Premium store content (paid content)
A lot of grinding. (Gathering materials, leveling up skills, etc)
Needing to rely on others to gather certain materials (This would not be an issue for most, but as someone with crippling social anxiety, it's almost impossible to gather these resources).
Not able to trade items with other people

Overall, this is a great free game, I'd give it an 8/10

Also, please fix the camera panning so it can cause less motion sickness  :"D</p>

      <p>I’m absolutely captivated by Palia for so many reasons. First off, the game truly shines when it comes to encouraging cooperative play—there's something so special about working together and building community in a space like this. And let me tell you, the lack of death penalties is a game-changer; it means I can dive deep into the story without worrying about losing progress. The decorating and crafting aspects are fantastic, offering endless ways to express my creativity and style. The storyline itself is engaging and full of depth, keeping me hooked from start to finish. Plus, I love that you can develop meaningful friendships and even romances with NPCs. It all combines to make Palia a rich and fulfilling experience, blending creativity, community, and storytelling in a way that really resonates with me.</p>

      <p>So I really really really loved the idea of this game. But the only real reason I'd want to play something like this is with my wife. And the visitor system they have here isn't good enough. Sorry.

We want to be able to live in the same house plot, and have all the same abilities without needing to invite her or have her visit every time. Plus when she does visit, even with the editor permissions given, she still can't place items she makes. So it's just a punch in the gut proof she doesn't actually live there with me.

If it has that kind of restriction what other restrictions will it have? Why not just make it so people can create a clan and then select a plot for that clan and then they can come and go, make edits, build and adjust as they want? 

Since we can't REALLY play this game together we won't be supporting it unless that changes. It wasn't bad for what we did play, but the whole point was to play together and thanks to those housing plot gameplay designs we can't really do that. So unfortunately we have to pass on this one.</p>

      <p>I really loved this game at first and got hooked right off the bat because i love grind to improve type of games....

The problem with this game overall is theres not enough information given to players about whats going on and what there is to look forward to and etc. LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND NEWS ALERTS THAT INFORM PLAYERS OF WHATS TO COME AND TO STAY TUNED FOR WITH NO TIME IN ADVANCE TO CONSIDER WHICH LEAVES PLAYERS FEELING SCAMMED TO THE POINT THEY DO NOT EVEN WANT TO PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE LET ALONE SUPPORT IT WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN MADE TO FEEL REGRET AND LIKE A FOOL AFTER SAID PURCHASE TO HELP SUPPORT SAID GAME..

For example. I decided to get two outfits yesterday upon one i really liked being released and they put the outfit in game and set it at 1700 in game coins which is ... A lot for a person of below average income but i said oh well it will make me happy BECAUSE  the game makes me happy and so i bit the bullet... Only to feel like a complete  FOOL when not even a few hours later they cut the prices down on the two outfits i bought full price IN LITERAL HALF just after i bought them for double the price. without ZERO NOTICE or NEWS ALERT... Feeling literally scammed out of my money THAT i could have literally stretched and gotten more out of and quite frankly like i just got ripped off considering they gave ZERO news alerts about the outfits being reduced in price AND ETC... but hey i guess they were dirty like that and most likely did it on purpose... im sure theres more folks like me feeling absolutely blind-sighted by the price-drop they did shortly after releasing it at a high one....like its absolutely ridiculous.... Literally any player who would have known would have waited to get it for half the price the same day it was released OBVIOUSLY but noooo. They gave ZERO NOTICE nor NEWS ALERTS IN GAME about this pricedrop ...ONLY ABOUT IT BEING RELEASED.... money grabbed players upon its immediate release at 1700 ... oh and the other outfit i got they cut down from 1275 to 678 or something just for even more collateral damage to my feelings of the purchases i regret more then anything now. 

It wouldnt have even bothered me if they atleast gave notice or immediatly released the outfits at the cutdown price. Its the principal of the matter and their antic  that literally TURNED ME STRAIGHT OFF from even wanting to play the game after feeling scammed like im sure others who did the same thing i did feel... the only thing that would make me feel better about it is if they corrected the wrong doing and made me feel whole which i have yet to hear back about after foling a ticket. Like that antic literally just costed them a consumer that was happy to support the game in the future with upcoming packs and etc.... Aint no way ill ever spend another penny on this game again just for the rug-pull of a move they did with the new outfit releast today. Nope. Thats hurtful to your customers. I dont get why they would even do that....

smh ... Disappointed is an understatement for what they did. I get its a free game but i cant believe this game doing this to the ones that DO support them ?

They literally ....

Released New out fit at double the price and then dropped it to half in not even a few hours.... YEAH I FEEL BAD FOR US PLAYERS WHO GOT PLAYED... good job????! like all u guys did was hurt the people who support you by doing that to not one but two of the outfits.... not nice.... Had it been made aware in game via the news alerts i wouldnt even be mad and take that L but yeah... LACK OF COMMUNICATION ON GAME STAFF BEHALF and just wanting to make people spend more to spend more and then doing that to them...  Imagine making your supporters feel STUPID? smh.....</p>

[✔️] 🧩 [B]Relaxed Progression[/B]: Unlike many MMOs, [I]Palia[/I] doesn’t pressure players to grind or rush through content. The game’s progression is more about personal goals and community milestones rather than leveling up or gearing out. This makes it an ideal choice for players looking for a more laid-back experience.

[❌] 🔄 [B]Limited Combat Mechanics[/B]: While [I]Palia[/I] includes some light combat elements, they are not a central focus. Players looking for intense battles or PvP may find the combat system too simplistic and lacking in depth compared to other MMOs.

[h2]Content & Replayability[/h2]

[✔️] 🌍 [B]Expanding World[/B]: [I]Palia[/I] features a growing world with regular updates that introduce new areas, quests, and items. This continuous expansion helps keep the game fresh and gives players new goals to strive for over time.

[❌] 📚 [B]Limited Narrative Depth[/B]: While [I]Palia[/I] offers a range of quests and stories, the narrative elements can feel secondary to the gameplay. Players looking for a deep, story-driven experience may find the plotlines to be somewhat shallow and not as engaging as other aspects of the game.

[h2]Life-Simulation and Social Aspects[/h2]

[✔️] 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 [B]Collaborative Gameplay[/B]: [I]Palia[/I] encourages players to work together, whether it’s building a communal project, trading resources, or participating in group activities. This collaborative gameplay fosters a strong sense of community and makes social interactions feel meaningful.

[✔️] 🏠 [B]Home Building and Customization[/B]: The game’s building system is one of its standout features, allowing players to design and customize their homes with a wide variety of furniture, decorations, and layouts. This aspect of the game is both creative and rewarding, giving players a personal space they can truly call their own.

[❌] 🕹️ [B]Lack of Traditional MMO Content[/B]: For those accustomed to traditional MMO features like raiding, competitive PvP, or complex skill trees, [I]Palia[/I] may feel lacking. The game’s focus is more on life-simulation and socializing, which might not appeal to all MMO enthusiasts.

[h2]Pros & Highlights[/h2]

[✔️] 🎨 [B]Cozy Atmosphere[/B]: [I]Palia[/I] excels in creating a warm and welcoming environment. Its art style, music, and community focus combine to make it a game where players can relax and enjoy the simpler pleasures of life.

[✔️] 🎮 [B]Accessible and Inclusive[/B]: The game’s design is approachable for players of all ages and skill levels. Its focus on cooperation and creativity over competition makes it an inclusive experience that can be enjoyed by a diverse audience.

[h2]Cons & Drawbacks[/h2]

[❌] ⏳ [B]Slow Progression[/B]: The game’s relaxed pace, while appealing to some, might feel slow or even sluggish to players used to faster progression in other MMOs. The emphasis on personal and community goals means there’s less of a clear path to "endgame" content.

[❌] 🧩 [B]Limited Challenge[/B]: [I]Palia[/I] is designed to be a relaxing experience, but this also means it lacks the challenge found in more traditional MMOs. Players seeking a game with difficult content or intense competition might find [I]Palia[/I] too easygoing.

[h2]Why 8/10?[/h2]

[I]Palia[/I] offers a refreshing take on the MMO genre with its focus on life-simulation, creativity, and community. Its charming visuals, collaborative gameplay, and relaxing atmosphere make it a standout for players seeking a more laid-back and social experience. However, its limited narrative depth, simplistic combat, and slow progression may not appeal to everyone, particularly those looking for more traditional MMO elements. Despite these drawbacks, [I]Palia[/I] excels in creating a cozy and welcoming world that invites players to slow down, build, and connect with others.

For about 2 months, I have tried everything to get to work. I send a data report out about this game, and I have not hard back from anyone. So I give up. I am deleting this game.

      <p>Terrible in every way possible.  mouse doesnt work.  control system is clunky.  it's hard to remember how to do things and I had to keep looking on the internet.  A lot of running (slowly) backwards and forwards with very little progress.  The whole game just feels very slow.  Overall the game did not grab me in the first few minutes, like all good games do.
If your looking for a totally free game then give it a go, but u have been warned!</p>

      <p>I'm sure that this is an incredibly fun game. However, I never made it passed character creation, as I spent an hour attempting to get ANY form of controls to work. The mouse function stopped working and I was unable to click on anything. My xbox controller did allow me to select things, but for some reason could not select ANYTHING from the two rightmost columns on any of the character creation tabs. This was fine, as most of my choices weren't in those columns. However, at the end, I could not finish my character creation, as whatever button it told me to use simply opened up the pause menu and ONLY let me resume by hitting the B button. I noticed that any attempt to navigate the pause menu would input on the character creation tabs and I was essentially just changing the way my character looked from the pause menu.  Even swapping back to the keyboard did not allow me to click the "finish character" button. I noted that the games store page has a note about how the Xbox controller has only partial compatibility and often displays the wrong input. 

Needless to say, I do not have the time or patience to attempt to figure out what controls ACTUALLY work, especially if they simply just won't. I understand that this game is still in Beta, so I don't want to write this game off completely, but as it currently is I genuinely cannot play it. I may try downloading again in the future, maybe it simply downloaded incorrectly somehow.</p>

I installed this game this morning I purchased it back in mid July so I am unable to get a refund.

I got into the game after making a character, I got up to the first point where you get a pick axe and have to clear debris, the game was bugged to where I could not select the pick axe and was unable to go forward, I had to force close the game to exit the game because I a lot of the menus was non functional. Upon reloading the game, it had my saved character, granted the buttons to do anything to select that character and enter into the gameplay world was non functional, if I was able to get a refund I would, this is fucking embarrassing, the game simply does not work, I really need to stop playing pre release games.</p>

      <p>I've played a lot of cozy games and by now I usually have some nitpicks about them. Including *gasp* Stardew. And while Palia does seem to plod along and have a bit of that grind mindset that is rampant in mmos I'm constantly astonished by it. I wasn't expecting much from a free-to-play game so I was blown out of the water by the quality! The graphics are good and it runs great. My computer is pretty specced out but this thing runs well on my old laptop fine as well. The look of it is adorable and the atmosphere is really relaxing. I enjoy the elements that push players to work together and help each other out and having no pvp is a great element. 

The cosmetics aren't free and can get a little pricey but I honestly don't mind. Each one has it's own charm and feels worth the pricetag considering the rest of this game is free and so well done. The inclusive nature of the game adds to the experience and I love that quests don't have a timer. Sure certain things are timed to events or certain time-spans but those are tied to IRL time and not in-game time which helps keep me from stressing out about a ticking clock of doom looming in the background as I hunt down items. All in all I'm seriously surprised this game is free and would've played it even if they'd charged me money for it. 

9/10 easily</p>

      <p>I don't speak for everyone in this game as there are a lot of people who very much enjoy the current mechanics and we are all entitled to our own opinions but as someone new to the game and getting slightly obsessed I'm just expressing a few things that have just completely frustrated me. 

- Limited Storage: I don't like how we are forced to essentially throw away items that we have farmed in order to preserve space, if I have spent hours farming for materials in a specific zone while levelling up my skills or even while trying to hunt a rare bug then I want to be able to keep a large portion of my supplies gathered rather than feeling forced to throw it into the shipping bin or convert it into planks, bars, etc. 

- Limited Farm Plots: One of the few things I was getting quite excited about was making a primary housing estate and then making a farm house on a secondary plot.. however after further investigation this wasn't possible due to being limited on the amount of farming plots I'm allowed to allocate to my property. (What a waste of 50k) 

- Gold Cap: I see no actual purpose forcing people to be gold capped at 999,999 (Previously 300,000) and then having an accomplishment to earn 100,000,000 gold.

- Tool Durability: Why aren't upgraded tools not pushed into a broken state instead of downgrading them when overused? It seems rather lazy/boring to force people to remake their tools with their resources if they just so happen to not be paying full attention to their durability rather than just going to repair the item. 

- Premium Currency: While I understand the developers need to make money to keep their game running, some of the outfits are absurdly expensive for a game that's in beta and I believe it would be a good addition to introduce ways to earn that currency in-game through participation in-game.

- Lack of trading/marketplace: One of the main concerns that I am reading as to why people are gate-keeping the idea of trading or having a marketplace in this game falls upon the economy being ruined by people gold-selling or gold-buying and truthfully while that can be used as a solid argument there are already numerous ways people are cheating to get ahead in the game and have ways to bypass the current 'request' system using hacks. 

- Character Creation: Please give us more ways to customise our characters (especially males) and please add a blonde hair colour!

I truly don't think Palia is a bad game. I just think there is still a lot of room for it to flourish.</p>

      <p>Palia refuses to use my dedicated graphics card even if I change the settings in Windows trying to froce the game to pick my dedicated graphics card. Hoping for a solution because like this it is unplayable. Uninstalling I am afraid and I don´t recommend installing it at all. It is supossed to be a game to ease your stress and anxiety but it will cause you a lot of both trying to actually run it with decent quality. 0/10.</p>

      <p>Questing was mostly enjoyable while it was tied to learning the game and exploring the maps, but I haven't seen any developments to the storyline since I started playing. No more quests. The achievements I'm missing (and the seasonal decoration collections) are just pure RNG grinds. Some of the quests are too.

The dev studio seems to be focusing on home plot building, decorating, and sharing your creations with others. Which is fine, but not the part of the game that hooked me.

I did enjoy running around the maps, calling out rare items for other people on the server, fulfilling players' item requests, making a couple friends. Hunting/Fishing/Bug Catching is like a casino. You get a dopamine hit when you find the rare star quality bug you were looking for, but it really comes down to RNG.</p>

      <p>They should warn on the Steam Page that this game is still in Early-Access. It looks great and promissing but doesn't really seem playable. Controller support is abysmal, and despite not working right, it detected my controller and even though I was reverted to play with K+B, it would vibrate the controller when it wanted (lol). The NPCs are the silent type, which don't match the game atmosphere but its ok for Early-access, and the quest system in a game that is supposed to be a farm-sandbox is counter-intuitive, it makes you think there is a goal/plot when there isn't.
I don't suggest it as of August 2024 if you are looking for a more complete experience, will come back when its more polished/finished, i am sure it will come out great.</p>

however 3000 in game currency is $30, you need to spend 3000 to get a cat pet which i want and rn the only way to get clothes i know of is to spend money. T_T
also can't zoom in or out.</p>

      <p>This is the best version of a fetch quest game, and I don't mean that sarcastically! The NPC's are engaging, the story line so far is engaging and a fun little dip into AU/isekai type protagonism and I am digging the overall aesthetic of the game! Even the base model clothing options have a little something for everyone. You CAN look cute without spending money but I have never before WANTED to spend money so badly on the premium store items! They are gorgeous and fun and everything you might need to level up your look. I am enjoying the crossplay options too between my PC and switch. It's VERY nice to be able to switch between systems depending on how I'm feeling in a day (I'm a mom so sometimes I just wanna chill on the couch instead of sitting at my computer after a long day wrangling little ones, ya know?). I am enjoying taking my time, decorating my house as I go, developing relationships with the NPCs, and exploring the world of Palia. If you are looking for a chill cozy game, get Palia. So far, it's two thumbs WAY up from me :)</p>

      <p>I'd describe Palia as this really cozy, fun and toxicity-free online multiplayer RPG. In some ways, I really feel like it's "Stardew Valley meets Hogwart's Legacy". I was looking for the perfect Open World / MMORPG -ish game style to play on my PC with my girlfriend (she's on Nintendo Switch) and I can definitely say this was the right pick! Hunting, fishing, farming, building, selling stuff, foraging, mining... and much more. It's worth the price, can't believe it's free! Also, mini-games in the Sewers are reeeeeeally addicting.</p>

      <p>I may have kept forgetting to leave a review. As of now the game has been in beta for about a year, though I've been playing since alpha 1, and has been improving during that whole time. The characters are wonderfully written and the world is beautiful. Does it have room for improvement? YES, but they are working on it!
Free to play and not pay to win, worth a try and don't be afraid to ask server chat for help ♥</p>

      <p>I am really enjoying this game. If you want something to chill and relax then look no further. It's like a fusion of Animal Crossing and The Sims. I enjoy farming, gathering, crafting and building my home as well as helping the villagers with quests. I like that it is a cooperative game and everyone is friendly and helpful but you can also completely play solo if you prefer.</p>

      <p>I think it's got a good progression without feeling too grindy. The day/night cycles are good lengths. The 'fast travel' system is fair. The drop-box system for money is *very* similar to every other farm sim (Harvest Moon, Stardew, etc). However, I feel like it's got a sort of mixed feel to it, like Stardew and Breath of the Wild had a pacifist and very social baby, and I'm not mad about it. The social aspect can make some quests a little bothersome, but the community is nothing but helpful. As a free-to-play game, I'm elated that it's as polished as it is. I can see younger teens enjoying it as much as older adults, and everyone in between. It's charming and doesn't push any socio-political agendas (refreshing).</p>

      <p>Most farming/survival games should learn some with this one, in fact I find tremendous embarrassing how much game there has to offer without paying a single penny. 
And if you do want to pay for some cosmetics, cause that’s all that is to pay with real money, there's absolutely no pop up, no message nor icon in game bothering you to do that. 
In fact, real money shop is only available on an in game appearance shop, and only if you visit it.
The rest is some pleasantly grindy, rewardingly-cosy-story-rich game, where you won’t notice how time flies, with no stress, no fuss, and one of the friendliest in-game communities I had the pleasure to interact with.
There’s a minor movement or graphic glitch, a few “bugs” that you cannot catch with your smoke bombs, but the game is beautiful, run great, and has steam achievs. So what’s not to love?</p>

      <p>I'm sure this game is fine or whatever but the character customization is abyssmal and very clearly geared towards fem people despite having a physical debuff or whatever and the animations are frankly bad. Controller support is awful and not even half assed despite being advertised as controller friendly. Kinda pissed off at the way all these games go towards you being sorrounded by diverse fantasy folk while youre  basic stick thin human. If there was any body options or other hair styles or anything maybe itd be better but frankly. Just how stupid my character looks threw me off immediately. Hope whoever enjoys this game has fun but I just cannot stand it.</p>

      <p>I was eager to play this game, but the incorporation of certain "progressive" concepts is proving to be quite frustrating. I tried to create a traditional male character, but it seems this is not well-supported in 2024. My male character moves and behaves like a female character, which is not what I anticipated. I find it particularly off-putting to see my character prancing around like a gazelle.</p>

      <p>Palia is very chill, great lax fun. Quests which are pretty easy but can be quite lengthy. Community in game is pretty positive and inclusive, except hotpot which can be a lil spicy but can easily be avoided.
Def recommend!</p>

      <p>As a free MMO RPG, this is a solid game. It's a good mix of farming and adventure, and with friends or a community this is an absolute blast. People that you randomly meet are also generally helpful with everything.</p>

      <p>I wish this game wasn't so hard to figure out what you're doing and where you're supposed to be going. Also, I wish you could see other maps, not just the one you're in, if that makes sense.</p>

      <p>The new system "Home Tour" seems like a good idea, but it's poorly implemented. It was supposed to be that people would show off their beautiful plots and get rewards for their efforts. In reality, it's begging for votes from other players that can take up 4-5 hours a day for a week and completely replace all other gameplay. This is the only way to get a reward for votes - nameplates. There is another way - to be lucky and get to the Trading tab, but it works unfairly, since this tab ends up with half-empty (or empty) plots, and real masterpieces are left aside. Also, the introduced tier 4 (1000 votes) for nameplates is impossible for most people to obtain, including people with very beautiful plots who totally deserve it. If rewards are introduced into the game, it should be obtainable by people who will put in a lot of effort for it. Getting tier 4 is currently a matter of luck to get to the Trading tab, that's it. Hopefully the system will be changed, as it frustrates many players who want nameplates and recognition for their efforts.

About the game in general: the game is good. It's stardew with other people, but without combats and farm management depending on the season. The game's community is its main treasure. The players are very friendly and cooperating with other people to do something in the game gives bright emotions. Cons: many bugs, instability, in-game chat does not work in some regions, which is a huge problem, predatory monetization, gacha.</p>

      <p>Nice chill game, especially if you have some friends to play with. its a bit grindy but in the nice way lol you move at your own pace, which with the main thing that i love about this game. you pay for skins and thats all. so no pay to win content. Newcomers shit on the store cosmetics, but i don't mind it for a f2p game. the store consists of cosmetics only, so what is there to complain about? if you like the game and you want to support the devs, buy a skin...if not, stfu and move on. its a f2p title with no competitive goals lol  i'm loving the game so far and love that i can play it on my Switch too. i hope to see great things from this games.</p>

      <p>A beautiful open word with lots to see and do.
There is a Friendship AND Romance system for the NPCs, and you can romance more than one NPC at a time!
Character creation isn't limited, and you can change up your clothes, hairstyle, looks, and gender without limit.
Lots of quests to do, and discover.
An absolutely AMAZING community!!! The other players are one of my favourite things about this game.
Emotive voice acting, and the characters have a routine. It's like if Stardew Valley and Dreamlight Valley had a dating sim baby.

I've tried to sneakily install this on my girlfriends laptop, but she caught me..</p>

      <p>I play Palia since it haven't in steam, and here is what I thought

This game is 100% no pay to win at all, and you don't have to fight for anything, which I really needed rn, Just fighting irl are enough to make me exhausted.
Cause I like building home and decorate things, this is kind of my stuff, and game still give some space for farming and collecting things and get recipe etc. which I think its really in a good pace, sadly its still in development and the variation is not large enough.

Only way for them to make money are the costume(cloth, hairstyle, pet, houseplot etc.) WHICH I ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THIS KIND OF GAME. 
I mean, I'm soooo bored of mostly free-to-play RPG game cause they likely force ppl to PVP, or even make the stealing function for player. And force ppl to getting stronger and pay to win.
But Palia is totally different, its not force you to do anything at all
You can play with you own pace, just do stuff you want to, and still can have interaction with ppl in game in another way than 'Army or Enemy' type of relationships, you can just stall around, say hi, gather things together, hunt together, farming together(which everyone can get the item, don't have to rush to be the first or try so hard for bloody last shot)

THIS is really the place to chill out and do your own things, grinded material to build up your own house in your own way

Still, for dev, even I really love your game, I have to say some of your move quite out of direction.
For example, the costume. I think you really need to change the hairstyle designer, most of feminine hair are not so good looking. And the cloth as well, not only design but also the concept, at first you make kind of rural outfit, like cottage girl with flower basket and mushroom etc. which I REALLY LOVE THOSE. But recently you came out with ..... sailormoon? Feeling quite out of place.
Hope you can provide some nice FARMING, archeologist, travelor outfit etc. with different vibe, maybe try to do the collection, not just swap some of pattern and color but do the set of theme costume.
And in my opinion, I need more light in the cloth set, cause we don't have torch here, so maybe give us some lantern?
Other thing in my mind quite hard to achive, like the chicken coop, milk cow etc. I know that require a lot of money and maybe its too much for now.
Just really looking for the new map 'the elderwood' which in expectation to release around next year. Hope things going on well.</p>

      <p>My spouse and I decided to try Palia out after seeing it was free and wanting a chill game to play together. Six hours later, we found ourselves stuck in the cycle of: "One more thing, just need to do one more thing..." before, glazed-eyed, we finally took a break. There's so much to do, the characters are charming, and the world to explore is much larger than I anticipated. A chillaxing mmo - exactly what I was looking for. I cannot wait to see this game grow!
Update: Getting further in, I would mention the grind is definitely tedious, so make sure you're into that before getting too invested!</p>

      <p>Well, I'm 613 hours into Palia in three months so safe to say I've been enjoying the game!

The one thing I love about Palia, is that I am 613 hours in and I haven't finished all the quests. Now, I have finished the main storyline quests and did some time ago, but I'm still working on the friendship/romance quests and the discoverable quests. You can work through this game as quickly or slowly as you want, because besides quests there is just so much to do.

I would absolutely recommend this game!</p>

      <p>AWESOME. 

I wasn't sure if the game would be good or if they just featured the decent parts of the game. It's actually really, really good. I've enjoyed playing it a lot and it brings tons of nostalgia to the table. 

There are elements of Fer.al, Free Realms, Genshin, and Stardew. Super cozy and the characters are actually probably written the best that I've ever seen. I'm super eager to see how this game progresses because it's backed up by a team that deeply cares for it.</p>
