            <h1>Customer experience</h1>
            <h2>COMPANY Built In</h2>
<h3>Customer Support and Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I was going on for like a week straight tweeting them about it and they finally responded only once saying they were investigating the issue, nothing back since and it's frustrating this has been in the game for like over half a year now basically." [(Single_Technology657, Reddit, 2024-06-17)]</li>
<li>"Just tell fortnite status on X to fix it. I told them and they said 'our team is aware of this issue and looking into it.'" [(Lord_of_da_Sith66, Reddit, 2024-06-08)]</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I wish I had not clean my reddit account, when I wrote a post in this subreddit I got laugh at when I suggested that things like this should be builtin. Very cool that we have a basic functionality like this." [(santtiavin, Reddit, 2024-04-05)]</li>
<li>"Fantastic. The less plugins I need to install, the better." [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-05)]</li>
</ul>
<h2>PRODUCT Built In</h2>
<h3>Performance and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"in performance, built-in is still better than URP in unity 2021 version." [(StinkySteak, Reddit, 2023-03-27)]</li>
<li>"Built-in: no support for the newest fancy features, like water and volumetric clouds. No vfx graph." [(TheDarnook, Reddit, 2023-09-15)]</li>
<li>"you are not limiting yourself to any platform, either with performance or quality. PC, VR, mobile - anything goes." [(TheDarnook, Reddit, 2023-09-15)]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility and Integration</h3>
<ul>
<li>"URP is great for any stylized look and it has a render pipeline converter that can convert all built in materials to URP." [(TinyAntCollective, Reddit, 2023-03-27)]</li>
<li>"the built in versions will often be custom Android builds, which then require the manufacturer to push out updates for rather than receiving the OTA updates from Google." [(wickedpixel1221, Reddit, 2022-11-03)]</li>
<li>"I have a TV with Android tv built in (and as such Chromecast) but I recently bought a Chromecast with Google tv and that's a much more enjoyable experience." [(MrSnowflake, Reddit, 2022-11-03)]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Neymar transformation still doesnâ€™t work. Predator removing his mask still doesnâ€™t work." [(TerribleSession7840, Reddit, 2024-08-09)]</li>
<li>"Any Uefn map will not allow you to use built in emotes that change your appearance. No idea why this is even a problem to begin with." [(Varutius, Reddit, 2024-06-07)]</li>
<li>"Very nice work. I was using my own implementation for comments, now I can remove it." [(gnikdroy, Reddit, 2024-04-06)]</li>
<li>"The 'core' has had <code>commentstring</code> for a long time now. The fact that there was nothing that used commentstring was baffling. Commenting is a basic enough functionality that it should have gotten an operator a LONG time ago." [(gnikdroy, Reddit, 2024-04-06)]</li>
<li>"I know nothing about the tree-sitter support, but: If the filetype of the buffer is associated with a language for which a treesitter parser is installed, then vim.filetype.get_option() is called to look up the value of 'commentstring' corresponding to the cursor position." [(disperso, Reddit, 2024-04-06)]</li>
<li>"I might be a little conservative here but, wouldn't it be better to NOT populate opt-in keymaps for such feature that could (and I imagine for the most people it's already the case) be a plugin?" [(shaksiper, Reddit, 2024-04-06)]</li>
