<h3>Positive Feedback</h3>

<li>"We switched to Osano, and that has been significantly better, but still not much contact post sale." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k6231ra/">(jdbrew, Reddit, 2023-10-23)</a></li>

<h3>Negative Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I was hoping Osano's compliance support team was more helpful. Additionally, what they consider traffic is questionable to me." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/kuo5kn1/">(lost-webCrawler, Reddit, 2024-03-13)</a></li>

<h2>Product Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Pricing and Cost</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Cost. For a single site, OneTrust was cheaper, but we added two additional domains that needed to be under a single consent agreement, and OneTrust was a per domain fee, while Osano is traffic based, and the math made sense to use their traffic based billing rates." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k62bbtm/">(jdbrew, Reddit, 2023-10-23)</a></li>

<h3>Usability</h3>
