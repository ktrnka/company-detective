<h3>Product Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"At first it can be overwhelming but you can get it up and running within a couple hours and you can allow/disallow all types of cookies and register them with the respective value type + the explanation." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/14kjuf3/what_are_people_using_for_cookie_consent/jpu4sen/">(sNok315, Reddit, 2023-06-28)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Cost-Effectiveness</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Cost. For a single site, OneTrust was cheaper, but we added two additional domains that needed to be under a single consent agreement, and OneTrust was a per domain fee, while Osano is traffic based, and the math made sense to use their traffic based billing rates." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k62bbtm/">(jdbrew, Reddit, 2023-10-23)</a></li>

<li>"I actually just switched again to Pandectes, because Osano doesnât comply with a lot of integrations with other data reporting tools." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/kuohgkr/">(jdbrew, Reddit, 2024-03-13)</a></li>
