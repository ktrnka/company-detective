<li>"I've used optuna to do bayesian optimization of my hyper-parameters including learning rate schedule and I just choose 300 epochs so trials would complete in a reasonable amount of time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/">(elbiot, Reddit, 2022-09-15)</a></li>
<li>"A trick I have done before, although it is by no means perfect, is to run hpo (or just a quick sweep) using only 5-10% of data, but going through the full training." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xeyzf7/d_how_does_one_choose_a_learning_rate_schedule/iojjsg1/">(koolaidman123, Reddit, 2022-09-15)</a></li>
<li>"I find that this strategy still works when I have hyperparameters which impact one another; holding one constant and optimizing the other works pretty well to balance them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/xvem36/d_how_do_you_go_about_hyperparameter_tuning_when/ir3egvh/">(king_of_walrus, Reddit, 2022-10-05)</a></li>
