        <h1>About Chewy</h1>
<p>Chewy, Inc. is a prominent American online retailer specializing in pet food and related products. The company was founded on June 1, 2011, by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day. Headquartered in Plantation, Florida, Chewy has grown to become a significant player in the pet supply industry. As of 2021, the company employed over 18,000 people in the United States (Wikimedia, 2016).</p>
<p>Chewy operates primarily in the B2C market, catering to pet parents with a wide range of products and services. The company offers over 110,000 high-quality items from 3,500 trusted brands, including food, treats, health and wellness products, and pet supplies for various animals such as dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, and small mammals <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mrchewy-com">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Chewy's revenue generation is driven by its extensive product offerings and services, including its Autoship subscription program, which allows customers to schedule regular deliveries of pet food, supplies, and medications. In 2023, Chewy reported net sales of $11.15 billion, marking a 10.2% year-over-year growth (Wikimedia, 2016).</p>
<p>The company has expanded its services to include Chewy Pharmacy, Connect with a Vet telehealth service, and CarePlus insurance and wellness plans. In 2024, Chewy launched Chewy Vet Care, a network of veterinary clinics offering routine check-ups, urgent care, and surgical procedures <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mrchewy-com">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>

      <p>Chewy is by far the best company I have ever ordered from . They truly care about animals . I have used chewy for many years and will
Continue to do so for our new puppy. When our ten year old dog passed a few months ago chewy not only refunded my newly ordered unopened dog food bag but told me to donate it to an animal shelter rather than return it . In addition they sent us condolence flowers and a card . One of the BEST companies out there would highly recommend to everyone !!</p>

      <h4>In memory of Molly, 5 stars (Maryland2010, Apple App Store, 2024-11-03)</h4>
      <p>When our beloved Molly passed away after a brief and devastating illness at age 8, I had just that day put in an order for her with Chewy, not knowing she’d be gone within hours. We were so heartbroken and I couldn’t stop from crying as I called Chewy to cancel my order. The man who took my call was so very kind and immensely helpful. He let me ramble and cry as we worked through the cancellation. The next day a bouquet of flowers arrived at our door care of a local florist from Chewy. I can never express just how much that meant to me in those days after our loss. Thank you, Chewy, for your terrific service but also for your extraordinary kindness.

Kimberly, Molly’s momma.</p>

      <h4>The Best!!, 5 stars (Renee12356, Apple App Store, 2024-11-01)</h4>
      <p>Chewy is absolutely the best when it comes to anything! Their customer service is great. They really lookout for the animals too. The area I live in had a hurricane and they donated lots of food to the area. I was also out of work and they made sure my cats were taken care of! I will always be a loyal customer to them for that! Anytime I’ve ever ordered food, it has never taken it more than 2 days to get to me. They will make anything right that isn’t (not that anything is ever wrong). The very first time I ever ordered food from them, the package was delivered to my neighbors house, who denied having it of course, Chewy replaced that order and I got it the next day! I will never order online from anywhere else. Chewy is just AMAZING!!</p>

      <p>I received this offer from Chewy twice over the summer and when I attempted to use the code on my order, it would not work.

My husband suggested that I call Chewy and address the issue. When I spoke with their representative, no explanation was given as to why I have received multiple cards that do not work, she simply said that she’d “check into it”. She gave me $15 off my current order which she applied from her end. What happened to the advertised $20 off??? This smacks of false advertisement. If this is how Chewy conducts business, I can shop at my local pet store PetCo, who regularly send me discounts through their customer loyalty program.</p>

      <p>There are many positive things to say about Chewy, yet above all, their Customer Service is unmatched!

I can’t find better prices for any food or prescription needs —- and that’s before I’m lucky enough to catch one of their many sales!

And beyond all of this, the speed of their deliveries is also superb. 

If you are looking for people who care about you and your pets needs, this is the place and NO, I do not work here or no anyone that does! That said, the business they run shows in their staffs kindness — and that has never failed if something goes wrong. 

Thank you for all that you do Chewy! Keep up the great work.

Sincerely,

Heidi Ferreira, her senior dog, Freja, and all of the wildlife too~</p>

I use auto ship for the main stuff and get treats and extras when I have the funds. The auto ship saves you even more money, so check it out.</p>

      <p>Trying to use a gift card on an order with this company is chaotic, and that is putting it mildly.

The way your order information is displayed on the screen. It looks like on one page shows it being deducted, then it looks like it’s being added back on on the final page.

 I don’t know what idiots they have in their IT department, but my personal opinion is a drunken 12-year-old could design their webpages in a more understandable manner!</p>

      <h4>Cat food for ten, 4 stars (Randy Ledford, Apple App Store, 2024-10-11)</h4>
      <p>The cats we take care of are all outdoor cats. They are spoiled with Friskees wet food and snub any other food that we’ve tried. The convenience of using Chewy home delivery is so much better than going to the store to buy it. The only problem is with the Fed-Ex delivery that treats the packages so rough!  Every delivery will have cans bent making them hard to open. We’ve had some bent so much that the cans have been open with product spoiled and unusable. Chewy customer service has in the past shipped me a free box which is appreciated but I would much rather not have the cans bent.

      <p>It saved me from placing a double amount of dog food than what I normally purchase.   It applied my coupon discount that I had earned from past purchases.  I didn’t have enter it myself.  That was awesome.  Easy to use.  My only complaint would be the auto ship doesn’t allow for every 6 months deliveries.  I live where it gets below freezing during winter months and I don’t want the food sitting in a delivery truck overnight or even outside my door for  several hours until I get home.  I would really be happy if they changed that because then I could save money on auto ship too!!!</p>

      <p>The actual app is relatively user friendly. My problem is with their auto ship. None of it has consistency. I feed over 20 feral’s outside every day and I depend on Chewy to get their food to me on time yet every month I have had issues. I set the date to be shipped and one month they tried taking the money 4 days in advance. I’m sorry but I don’t have unlimited funds and only get paid once a month. I then changed my delivery date and then they didn’t take the money out until after my shipping date and my order arrived late. It’s just not worth the frustration and headaches to use the auto ship unless you have a lot of money. I will no longer be using the auto ship and pay the difference.</p>

      <p>I am a loyal Chewy customer.  One time my order of expensive dog food and treats and chews had been left in a bad area and when I opened it ants were everywhere, in the dog food and all the treats and chews.  I left it outside and dreaded calling customer service and how I would probably have to tell my story to lots of people that are not fluent in English and would have to argue to get a refund…even if I got a refund, what am I going to feed my dogs?  Should I send my son to Petsmart and pay so much more?   I called and was pleasantly surprised when a very nice representative apologized and said he would be happy to send me a replacement and he promptly sent me the dog food and chews, I was so pleased.   Have now gotten my brother buying his special cat food for his four cats at Chewy.  I am a loyal customer and love knowing that if something happens to an order, Chewy will make it right!</p>

      <p>I’ve been a customer for years.  I placed 2 orders last week alone.   Recently, something shifted.    When I didn’t receive an item, I used chat in the app.  I’m not sure if they’re using AI or people who aren’t engaged, but the “agent” said they would need to conduct a 14-day investigation for a lost $12 can of broth. No refund.  No replacement.   Well, guess what?  Chewy isn’t the only option. You just lost a loyal customer who spends a good amount of money with you every 2 weeks or so.  I’m not sure if they’re using chat bot was AI or human, but it’s not the service you used to deliver.</p>

      <h4>Chewy’s the Best, 5 stars (ksb1221, Apple App Store, 2024-09-22)</h4>
      <p>Chewy is really the best business of all businesses. It’s extremely rare, but any time something is wrong they resolve the problem completely without hesitation. There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. 
Ordering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. 
They have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. 
Thank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻</p>

Recently I had to cancel a dog food subscription due to health issues in our dog. However, a big bag of food was already on the way that we could no longer feed our dog with. They said they will refund me the full amount. I said “how will I return it to you guys?” She replied-donate it to a local shelter. I have never seen a company actually care about anything other than themselves. Chewy cares about your animals needs, and all the others that might not have found a home yet. That is something I think so highly of and I hope others do as well. Thank you Chewy for having the morals that you do.</p>

      <p>I absolutely love Chewy. I’m not a huge fan of ordering things that I can buy in the store, but their prices are competitive, they have a huge variety of products, and recommend and remind you of vet visits when it’s that time again. Bonus: your orders are stored so if your animal loves something but you can’t remember the name or product you can just review your history. The only downside I’ve experienced so far is their packages must go thru the RINGER when shipping because every box I’ve received has been mangled and close to falling apart 🤣😅 the merchandise itself was fine, but that box must’ve been bunt kicked any time it needed to move 😭🤷‍♀️</p>

      <p>For example, if you want to change your autoship items, you have to do it from within the autoship menu, which will not scroll on the website or the app. If you find the item you want by searching, it can’t be added to the autoship, you have to buy it individually or set up and entirely new autoship. Again, the store itself is fine, but the interface is frustrating and terrible.</p>

      <p>Chewy is a fantastic company. I’ve been a loyal customer for a few years now and I tell everyone I know with pets to give them a try. They have fair prices, fast shipping, wonderful customer service…and the best part? All of the reviews are honest, candid reviews from actual customers. Reviews you can trust (for the most part, I think some things might be biased or whatever lol) can be hard to come by with all of these companies paying for reviews. Chewy is a reputable company who has never let me down and I will continue to be loyal to them :) 

Give them a try if you have cats, dogs, birds, horses, hamsters, fish, snakes, or a Lorax you love and want to keep happy and healthy!</p>

      <h4>Amazing Customer Service!!, 5 stars (jrosenberg21, Apple App Store, 2024-09-12)</h4>
      <p>This is my favorite website with which to do business. They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. 
I trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. 
I love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. 
Thanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. 

Jen, Ephraim & Sadie</p>

I’m trying dry Ocean feast, Reveal because the wet Reveal doesn’t have enough nutrients. 
Adding their dry makes it complete. 
It’s not auto ship yet, and I didn’t want to wait 2 more weeks, so I ordered a bag today!
Knowing  if he does not like it I will be refunded, is the piece of mind I love. Thank you for the best customer service.</p>

      <p>So frustrating! Could not check out glitching system. Spoke with chat customer service rep named Shante F . Tied me up 15 minutes in chat asking me to repeat my email address at least three times my home address at least three times and my name several times.. She could not see items in my cart so I had to send a screenshot of what I could see in my cart. I need her to do help me pay for my order and let me go on my way. Was useless after all the conversation, total waste of time, she says I can’t help you. You need to call the customer service line.  She disconnected me from the line ending the conversation and I could not proceed. I had to start all over again with another.</p>

      <h4>Chewy is the Best Corporation with the Best Customer Service, 5 stars (Apple App Store, 2024-09-04)</h4>
      <p>I have never had a problem or a bad experience in dealing with Chewy!  The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  
On a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  
A few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.

I hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.
Thank you</p>

When I’m trying to apply search filters, it applies them until a certain point, then randomly clears them all and I have to start all over to try to find what I’m looking for. It’s happened about 6 times in the last hour, so I’ll be trying to use the website instead. It also glitched and the app crashed entirely and restarted at one point.

      <p>Every company should take lessons from Chewy.  Every order received is exactly as I submitted it.  If there is a reason to exchange something because I’ve ordered the wrong size or style etc Chewy always has a suitable resolution.  If your pet doesn’t care for what you just ordered for them, just call Chewy and you will be amazed at how accommodating they are.  Don’t ever be afraid to try something out because should your pet stick their nose up at it and stare at you like “why did you order THAT for me….dont fret, Chewy has your back… just call them and they will make you and your pet happy again.  I highly recommend this company!!</p>

      <h4>Chewy is the best company out there!!, 5 stars (Clairedabanana, Apple App Store, 2024-08-19)</h4>
      <p>I just started using Chewy for my cat and when I signed up I received a hand written note welcoming me to the Chewy family. I started using them because I wanted to get my kitty a better quality food but she ended up not liking it and I was stuck with an un opened box. I used the chat in app to request a return which was answered almost immediately and was super easy to use. The woman who helped me (Kandace C.) was so nice and said that there was no need to ship anything back and to donate my extra food to a local shelter 🥹. I thought this was so cool and thoughtful and solidified my love for chewy. They are a really cool company and buying food on here is way easier and cheaper than in store and with auto ship it comes right when she is running low so there is no stress of having to make time to pick up more food. I could not recommend chewy enough. Truly a great company I will be using them for life!</p>

      <p>We love it when our chewy order arrives.  Our mum is happy too.  It saves her $$ so she can buy more treats for us 😸😸.  Saves hauling heavy bags of litter from store to car to home.  
Arrives at our house in a timely manner so that we don’t go hungry.  She also gets just enough friendly reminders from chewy about reordering everything we need.  Sometimes we even get toys to play with and we love our cat scratcher which saves the furnitures.  
Thank you Chewy from Harry 😻 and Polly😻</p>

      <p>I love Chewy as a company! I hear great stories about them and how much they actually care about pet owners. They have a super wide selection of items at good items and our kittens have loved everything from Chewy we’ve ordered. HOWEVER there is one glitch in the app that’s making it near impossible for me to use. Whenever you are browsing items and select one, once you go back to your search results, they’re gone and you have to do the search all over again. This happens when you click through their preset categories to browse too, every time you go in/out of an item it takes you back too far. Please fix this! It makes it so much harder to find what I’m looking for and you deserve 5 stars otherwise!</p>

      <h4>Great Customer Service, 5 stars (TwilightDoves, Apple App Store, 2024-08-08)</h4>
      <p>First time dog owner. I decided to give Chewy a try. They were recommended by a family member who has smaller exotic pets. First auto ship. My doggy HATED his food. 🤣 He barely tolerated the kibble that his shelter sent me home with. And he loved TikiDog wet food. But he wouldn’t touch the Tikidog dry lamb. I let Chewy know and they refunded me. I assumed they were then going to ask me to drop off the refunded product somewhere but instead they said to donate it to a shelter. So I did. Their chat service is very helpful. I even messaged them at midnight once because I kept forgetting to during the day and their response is fast. 

I’ve only had one order mess up in the 7 months I’ve been a customer. They had forgotten 2 items in my last auto ship. They apologized and overnighted the remaining items. Simba and I customers for life! 🥰</p>

      <p>My dog and I love Chewy. I love that they’re constantly adding new items, they have great sales, and their customer service is unmatched. 
My dog loves lick mats. So when I saw an option under the dog treat section to sort by “lickable treats” I was thrilled! I never know what to look up to find those sorts of treats to put on her lick mats. However, whenever you click on the link for lickable treats, it takes you to the section for “soft and chewy treats”. It’s almost like the lickable treat section wasn’t supposed to go live yet or something. I just wanted to bring it to the developers attention and hopefully get it resolved so my dog and I can make our next purchase!!</p>

      <p>I’ve been using chewy for years out of necessity and they have always been great but there delivery service is necessity not great. They pack dry food bags in with 40 pound cat liter and it destroys the food. I request door delivery and they never do it. I wish they would listen to their customers.</p>

      <h4>Lack of shipping info, 3 stars (Missing shipping info, Apple App Store, 2024-07-23)</h4>
      <p>Chewy doesn’t provide shipping information before finalizing checkout. Sometimes I need things more urgently and don’t appreciate not finding out about even approximate shipping/receipt dates before the sale. This is not up to standards for customer service. Otherwise it has excellent selection and average prices.</p>

      <p>Shipping is super fast. Product selection is fantastic. Prices are always at or near lowest. Chewys customer service is number one in by book. They always make sure we are taken care of. I’m also involved in a pet rescue, and I appreciate them even more for donating their returns to rescues across the country. Rescue Pack out of Chicago is my connection, and we LOVE it when there are Chewy pallets on the bid list. ❤️</p>
