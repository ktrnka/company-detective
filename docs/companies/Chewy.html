Despite these positive figures, the company's stock has experienced volatility, influenced by broader market conditions and investor expectations <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20241216119/how-chewys-stock-is-shedding-its-meme-stock-past-amid-strong-execution">(Rogers, Morningstar, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>
<p>Chewy is ranked No. 10 in Digital Commerce 360's Top 1000 list of North America's largest online retailers <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Williams &amp; Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.

<h2>Customer Base and Growth Strategies</h2>
<p>Chewy's active customer base reached 20.2 million in Q3 2024, with a slight increase from the previous quarter but a 0.5% decline year-over-year <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-updated-experiences-active-customers-membership-q3/735183/">(Wassel, Retail Dive, 2024-12-12)</a>.

      <p>The essance land and fowl dog food I have Asha on is very good food solid healthy ingredients, been using it for over 5 years & never any issues ,tried another brand and didn’t work for her .
Been ordering from chewy for years , my dog was allergic to a dog food & chewy refunded me and said to donate it ,also I get my order in 2 days. 
For these two things alone I will always order from chewy plus it’s easy to order on their website and I have my dogs history on there so I know what worked and  what didn’t just by looking. 5 stars 🌟 for my dog food and for chewy.com</p>

      <p>Chewy is by far the best company I have ever ordered from . They truly care about animals . I have used chewy for many years and will
Continue to do so for our new puppy. When our ten year old dog passed a few months ago chewy not only refunded my newly ordered unopened dog food bag but told me to donate it to an animal shelter rather than return it . In addition they sent us condolence flowers and a card . One of the BEST companies out there would highly recommend to everyone !!</p>

      <p>I can’t say enough amazing things about Chewy!
Not only do they go above and beyond with their customer service, but they genuinely care about their customers and their pets. Every year, they send my dog the sweetest birthday card, which always puts a smile on my face. 

But what really sets them apart is their approach to returns. When I’ve had to return an item, they’ve told me to donate it instead, which shows their incredible generosity and commitment to making a difference. 

Chewy just isn’t a company-it’s a partner in pet care that truly cares. I highly recommend them to any pet parent!</p>

      <p>For example, if you want to change your autoship items, you have to do it from within the autoship menu, which will not scroll on the website or the app. If you find the item you want by searching, it can’t be added to the autoship, you have to buy it individually or set up and entirely new autoship. Again, the store itself is fine, but the interface is frustrating and terrible. People have also been talking about how good their customer service is in their reviews, but I’ve never once been helped by their chatbot-based support system. Forth example, when I told them that their system was recommending discontinued items, chatbot’s response “we have never had this issue reported before.” Oh really? Because I’m reporting it right now, you dismissive little robot.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using chewy auto ship for at least 4 years. Well that comes to an end today. When you set up items on auto ship…you start to notice when the bill is now $20 more than last time. Basically, make sure your auto ship is getting the auto ship discount every month on your items. 
I’ll be shopping locally. I don’t appreciate CHEWY playing in my face while they have my credit card info…then their chat agents act dense. I’m literally looking at the product and seeing the auto ship price wasn’t applied, although you already charged my card. Your shareholders can shove it.</p>

      <p>Hello. I am a Chewy customer who is blind. I use the VoiceOver screen reader on my iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.0.1. The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?</p>

      <p>Trying to use a gift card on an order with this company is chaotic, and that is putting it mildly.

The way your order information is displayed on the screen. It looks like on one page shows it being deducted, then it looks like it’s being added back on on the final page.

 I don’t know what idiots they have in their IT department, but my personal opinion is a drunken 12-year-old could design their webpages in a more understandable manner!</p>

      <h4>Chewy is the best!, 5 stars (TLCKGC, Apple App Store, 2024-11-08)</h4>
      <p>I have ordered all my pet supplies and food from Chewy for years and have never been dissatisfied with their products or customer service. They are always there for me and so thoughtful and kind. I love that they send birthday cards to my pets as I currently have 6 dogs and 2 cats and it is very heart warming for all of us. We recently lost 2 dogs, Daisy that was 15-1/2 years old and Domino unexpectedly at only 5 years old with kidney disease told to us by the ER vet from ingesting antifreeze as a puppy prior to us rescuing him. Both losses were devastating to us as these rescues are our children. Chewy was so kind as to send an email with their condolences. I was very touched by that and cried again. Once when I lost my 15 year old cat Oliver, they sent a dozen of the most beautiful roses I have ever seen! I cried then too. And they also sent me a Chewy ball cap and tennis ball for the pups as a thank you! Granted I do spend a lot at Chewy due to all our rescues, but they do not have to do all these extras. They are the only company I have dealt with that let’s you know they truly appreciate your business. So a HUGE THANK YOU TO CHEWY and God bless you always!  We love you!</p>

      <h4>Chewy is a godsend 🙏🏼, 5 stars (FauneFlora, Apple App Store, 2024-09-09)</h4>
      <p>I have an auto ship for my cats flea/tick/heartworm medicine because I am terrible at remembering when I need to order more. My most recent one said it was delivered the 22nd of August, but I never received it. Considering it was $145 and it was something my cats actually needed, I decided to utilize their live chat to see what they could do. Within 5 minutes, they sent me a replacement! They really take the stress out of every step!! I’m so grateful.</p>
