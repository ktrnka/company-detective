        <h1>About Chewy</h1>
<p>Chewy, Inc. is a prominent online retailer specializing in pet food and supplies, founded on June 1, 2011 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mrchewy-com">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. The company operates primarily in the United States, offering a wide range of products and services for pet owners. Chewy's offerings include pet food, treats, hard goods, pharmacy categories, over-the-counter medications, and medical prescription fulfillment. The company also provides pet services for various animals, including dogs, cats, fish, birds, small pets, horses, and reptiles, through its retail websites and mobile applications <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mrchewy-com">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Chewy's business model is primarily B2C, targeting pet owners directly. The company generates revenue through the sale of pet products and services, with a significant portion coming from its auto-ship program, which ensures regular delivery of pet supplies to customers <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Williams &amp; Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>. As of Q3 2024, Chewy reported net sales of $2.88 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.8% <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Williams &amp; Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>
<p>Chewy serves a large customer base, with 20.2 million active customers as of late 2024, although this represents a slight decline from previous figures <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-updated-experiences-active-customers-membership-q3/735183/">(Wassel, Retail Dive, 2024-12-12)</a>.

However, the company faces challenges from competitors like Amazon and PetSmart, which are increasing their investments in e-commerce <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Williams &amp; Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>

This initiative reflects Chewy's commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the veterinary profession.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Future Outlook</h2>
<p>Chewy faces challenges from increased competition and the need to improve customer retention rates. Operating expenses rose by 3.3% year-over-year to $818.2 million <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Williams &amp; Meisenzahl, Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>. The company is expected to report its Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results on March 26, 2025 <a href="https://www.stocktitan.net/news/CHWY/chewy-announces-fiscal-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial-l24i6q243hb3.html">(Chewy Inc, StockTitan, 2025-03-03)</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Chewy remains a significant player in the pet supplies e-commerce market, with a strong focus on customer satisfaction and strategic growth initiatives. However, it must navigate challenges related to competition and customer retention to sustain its growth trajectory.</p>

      <p>I recently got two cats and have been having a hard time figuring out what litter works for them. I ordered some off Chewy (Arm & Hammer Litter Clump & Seal Multi-Cat Scented Clumping Clay Cat Litter, if you’re curious) and it did NOT work well. I left a review of the product and shortly after, a customer service representative reached out, refunded me the price of the litter, and we worked out what litter would work best for me! I haven’t received it yet, but I’m very impressed with Chewy.</p>

      <h4>Amazing Compassion, 5 stars (Patricia Aispuro, Apple App Store, 2025-03-05)</h4>
      <p>I cannot say enough about the kindness and compassion of Chewy. I recently purchased a bag of food for my dog, but heartbreakingly, he passed away before it arrived. When I reached out to return it, they not only gave me a full refund but also asked me to donate the food to a pet in need. That alone was incredibly thoughtful, but this morning, I received a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers from Chewy, along with a heartfelt note offering their condolences.

In a time of loss, their kindness and empathy meant so much. This is more than just a company—it’s a team of truly caring people. Thank you, Chewy, for going above and beyond. I will forever be a loyal customer. ❤️🐾</p>

      <p>I’m updating my review from what I’d written before (right after speaking to the one and only impatient rep I’ve encountered with Chewy).  I’ve had great luck using the app and Chewy as a company saves me the hassle of having yet another stop to make as i go through my to do lists each month.  It may not sound like much, but not having to make multiple trips for multiple pets to multiple locations when fuel is $5 a gallon and i already have a million other things to do IS AMAZING.  I recently had some shipping related issues (for unknown reasons), but like always, Chewy’s best self shines through with stellar customer service and a helpful attitude.  Thank you, Chewy, and an even bigger thanks to the incredibly patient rep I spoke with today!</p>

When a pet crosses the Rainbow Bridge, they actually send a Sympathy card & flowers. Great customer service from a company that really seems to care.</p>

      <h4>From one star to five stars, 5 stars (Odienne, Apple App Store, 2025-02-27)</h4>
      <p>Edited review: chewy reached out to me for more information on what happened, and there turned out to be miscommunication between me, chewy, and blue buffalo. Chewy made this situation right and I’m changing my review from one star to five stars, and with the new information I have, in the future I’ll avoid this happening again. I recommend reaching out to chewy via chat rather than email if you have any issues as you’ll get more personalized help rather than what seems to be generic responses. 

Original review:
Chewy sold me a bag of food that made my cats physically ill. They were vomiting several times per day, and when I reached out to chewy about it, they blamed me and refused a refund. With petco and PetSmart offering most of the same deals chewy does, including repeat deliveries to your door, I highly recommend you go anywhere else.</p>

      <p>When my husband needed to go to another state for medical treatment, we had to board the cat with our veterinarian.
We always take our own food, since KitKat can be a little picky.
When we needed to be gone an extra 2 weeks, we needed more food.  Not wanting to pay for the specialty veterinary food,  I thought of Chewy!   Ordered the food, 2 days later it was delivered and we could concentrate on husband’s health again.  Thanks Chewy!</p>

      <p>I had a subscription for feed for my pack of 6 dogs. Thinking I’d get the same feed shipped on the same day just didn’t come true after the 3rd week. They have no clue or method of what feed is available in what warehouse even though that very tech has been around for 40 years. I’d get my shipment notifications and the tracking would be 3 days after it should come leading me to go out and buy a bag of food for the pack on top of the bag that is coming. Seems I’d run out due to the feed coming from who knows where. I find it saddening that they literally have no clue how to track stock levels and let you know your delivery is going to be late due to the shipping times. I’ve gotten deliveries from Washington state and I live in Ohio! By the time the food got here, 1/4 had been pulverized into powder.</p>

      <p>I have been using Chewy for around 9 years and it is the best company I ever used for anything. They gained my loyalty by refunding me money for a food that upset my dog’s stomach, asking me to donate that food, and then helping me choose something better for my pup. Since then, I’ve added pups to my crew and Chewy has been there every step of the way. I’ve ordered food, treats, medicine, toys, and dog accessories of all kinds and have never had a bad experience. My dogs get birthday cards and Christmas cards. They’ve sent me a painting of one of my dogs!! They are all around an incredible company to their patrons and seem to truly care about animals. The prompt for this review was an email from Chewy apologizing for a delay in shipping due to extreme weather, which is 100% out of their control, and they apologized and provided monetary compensation via a gift card. I did not complain or reach out about this delay, they just wanted me and my dogs to be happy! I love this company!!! If I could work for them I would!</p>

      <h4>Search Still Broken, 1 stars (zeizbiz, Apple App Store, 2025-02-08)</h4>
      <p>Searching for “Authority” sends you into an endless loop of Our Brands. Happens every time you search and even if you scroll and select the brand it still sends you back to the Our Brands page. There is no way in the app to report bugs with search, and it’s high time something was implemented because the search in this app is lacking.</p>

      <h4>Loyal as a Dog for Chewy!, 5 stars (Dicksucka6969, Apple App Store, 2025-02-06)</h4>
      <p>Chewy is hands down the best business I’ve interacted with in a long time. And the fact that Chewy is committed to serving people and pets of all kind makes it an honor to shop there. But there’s so much to love:

- They have everything a pet parent could want at often better prices than big box pet stores.

- The interface and organization is easy to use and with just enough detail in the filters to look for the perfect purchase.

- Have an issue? Their support is incredible. They truly go above and beyond to make sure that the customer is happy. I had a friend whose beloved pet passed away and when they reached out to cancel an auto ship order that was already on its way, chewy refunded the order and told them to donate the cat food THEN sent them a sympathy bouquet! Who does that? Chewy does! 

- Pet profiles which help you manage your purchases and recommend what is right for your pet. I also was so surprised when out of nowhere Chewy sent me a free painting of my pet dog! I had used the funniest picture and they really captured my little goofball. Things like this aren’t the exception though- they define the brand! Chewy loves bringing joy to pets and pet parents!</p>

      <h4>Promos don’t work, 2 stars (The first snow, Apple App Store, 2025-01-04)</h4>
      <p>I’ve encountered so many promo codes, even on the website, and not a single one has worked—including ones that were advertised WITH the item I tried to use it with! 

I feel like they do it to entice you to put things in your cart, assuming once you realize the code doesn’t work you’re likely to make the purchase anyway since you’re already there.

Just a guess but I wouldn’t put it past any company. Regardless, that’s been my experience thus far.</p>

      <p>Chewy offers a level of service and quality you just don’t find in other companies. Chewy not only cares about your pet, but they care about pet parents too. I’ve experienced exceptional service and care during the aging and death of my 16 year old dog and Chewy has celebrated the joy of my new puppy as well. They really care about the needs of my pets and I feel like I have a friend in Chewy.</p>
