      <p>trying to set up autoship was harder than with other websites. I had several items I wanted autoshipped, but you have to set up the frequency in the checkout process. when I tried that, it makes every autoship item come at he same rate. I wanted cat food every 6 months, and treats every 3 months, but that's not possible with chewy's system. Also, it offered $20 off the 1st autoship, plus I had a 15$ off promo sent to me by chewy. The checkout changed my $20 discount to a 15$ discount. grrr</p>

      <h4>Awesome Customer Service, 5 stars (Ants in the Box, Apple App Store, 2024-10-02)</h4>
      <p>I am a loyal Chewy customer.  One time my order of expensive dog food and treats and chews had been left in a bad area and when I opened it ants were everywhere, in the dog food and all the treats and chews.  I left it outside and dreaded calling customer service and how I would probably have to tell my story to lots of people that are not fluent in English and would have to argue to get a refund…even if I got a refund, what am I going to feed my dogs?  Should I send my son to Petsmart and pay so much more?   I called and was pleasantly surprised when a very nice representative apologized and said he would be happy to send me a replacement and he promptly sent me the dog food and chews, I was so pleased.   Have now gotten my brother buying his special cat food for his four cats at Chewy.  I am a loyal customer and love knowing that if something happens to an order, Chewy will make it right!</p>

      <p>I am getting very disappointed with your sales pitch about a 30 $ discount that you are advertising via email to me and never apply to my order at the checkout.
I find it is false advertising to use this sales tactic on a continuous basis. Please don’t send me any more 30 dollar discount offers unless I can apply it easily to my order.

      <p>I’ve been a customer for years.  I placed 2 orders last week alone.   Recently, something shifted.    When I didn’t receive an item, I used chat in the app.  I’m not sure if they’re using AI or people who aren’t engaged, but the “agent” said they would need to conduct a 14-day investigation for a lost $12 can of broth. No refund.  No replacement.   Well, guess what?  Chewy isn’t the only option. You just lost a loyal customer who spends a good amount of money with you every 2 weeks or so.  I’m not sure if they’re using chat bot was AI or human, but it’s not the service you used to deliver.</p>

      <h4>Chewy’s the Best, 5 stars (ksb1221, Apple App Store, 2024-09-22)</h4>
      <p>Chewy is really the best business of all businesses. It’s extremely rare, but any time something is wrong they resolve the problem completely without hesitation. There is no automated message when you call. Of the dozens of times I’ve called, a human in America has answered by the second ring. They’re friendly and always ask about my cats by name. A few times I’ve had to tell them about one who had passed away, a few days later I get a hand written sympathy card from them. 
Ordering prescription food and medicine is a breeze. You place the order online, they call the vet for authorization, and they always ship immediately. 
They have a service where you can have a 20 minute virtual vet visit for 20.00. I’ve used it many times. I’ve used it after having an in-person visit and then think of more questions afterward, doesn’t that always happen? I’ve been able to send them pictures, X-rays and bloodwork results. They read them for me and help me understand whatever I didn’t understand at the office. These vets are great and always finish up by sending a summary of the visit and their recommendations. And they send relative articles for your information. I’ve tried the free nurse line through my pet insurance, all they do is tell you to go to the vet. Chewy’s vets actually help you avoid an office visit and will only send you if they know it’s necessary. 
Thank you for everything, Chewy!! 😻</p>

Recently I had to cancel a dog food subscription due to health issues in our dog. However, a big bag of food was already on the way that we could no longer feed our dog with. They said they will refund me the full amount. I said “how will I return it to you guys?” She replied-donate it to a local shelter. I have never seen a company actually care about anything other than themselves. Chewy cares about your animals needs, and all the others that might not have found a home yet. That is something I think so highly of and I hope others do as well. Thank you Chewy for having the morals that you do.</p>

      <p>I absolutely love Chewy. I’m not a huge fan of ordering things that I can buy in the store, but their prices are competitive, they have a huge variety of products, and recommend and remind you of vet visits when it’s that time again. Bonus: your orders are stored so if your animal loves something but you can’t remember the name or product you can just review your history. The only downside I’ve experienced so far is their packages must go thru the RINGER when shipping because every box I’ve received has been mangled and close to falling apart 🤣😅 the merchandise itself was fine, but that box must’ve been bunt kicked any time it needed to move 😭🤷‍♀️</p>

They are always polite and helpful and they treat me like they really appreciate me as a customer. I can rely on them and recommend them to all my fellow pet owners. I will continue to use them as long as I have furry friends.</p>

      <p>Chewy is a fantastic company. I’ve been a loyal customer for a few years now and I tell everyone I know with pets to give them a try. They have fair prices, fast shipping, wonderful customer service…and the best part? All of the reviews are honest, candid reviews from actual customers. Reviews you can trust (for the most part, I think some things might be biased or whatever lol) can be hard to come by with all of these companies paying for reviews. Chewy is a reputable company who has never let me down and I will continue to be loyal to them :) 

Give them a try if you have cats, dogs, birds, horses, hamsters, fish, snakes, or a Lorax you love and want to keep happy and healthy!</p>

      <h4>Amazing Customer Service!!, 5 stars (jrosenberg21, Apple App Store, 2024-09-12)</h4>
      <p>This is my favorite website with which to do business. They are amazing with their customers. We got our new kitten a little less than 1.5 years ago and we weren’t sure what she was going to end up eating at first. As soon as we brought her home, we ordered the same wet & dry food that her breeder had been feeding her. As she started displaying various neurological symptoms, she began eating less and struggling to chew food. We became worried about giving her any wet food that wasn’t the consistency of baby food because she was starting to cough when she was eating. At about 6 months old, her vet sedated her to make sure there was nothing in the way of her throat. While at her visit, the vet fed her a Rx diet food that she absolutely loved by comparison to the wet food we were giving her. By switching to the prescription wet food exclusively, she started putting on weight again…even though she remained very small. Chewy helped us make the switch by running it through her vet’s office for the authorization of the Rx food. Then, they refunded us for the remaining wet and dry food that she’d stopped eating. This site even recommended that we donate the remaining food we had to a locate shelter or humane society (after they’d refunded us in full for the cost of this food). The people who answered the phone really showed us how much they cared about not just our little one, but about encouraging their customers to donate the refunded food to help local animal populations when other companies would have insisted the food be shipped back to them, even if they only ended up throwing it out or destroying it. 
I trust them with all of our purchases for kitty, Sadie. They free us up to focus on giving her whatever diet best supports her health. This has been so helpful as we’ve adjusted to her changing needs. They even sent us a card and a toy after hearing about Sadie’s difficulties! It’s rare to find a company that legitimately cares for their customers. 
I love this company and I’ll remain a customer forever. 
Thanks to Chewy and all the representatives who work for them by answer the phone. This company behaves in such a refreshingly empathic way. I recommend them to everyone I ever talk to about their pets. 

Jen, Ephraim & Sadie</p>

If he does love it, I add it to auto ship.
Win-win!

Adding their dry makes it complete. 
It’s not auto ship yet, and I didn’t want to wait 2 more weeks, so I ordered a bag today!

      <h4>Chat awful!, 2 stars (anndollie, Apple App Store, 2024-09-04)</h4>
      <p>So frustrating! Could not check out glitching system. Spoke with chat customer service rep named Shante F . Tied me up 15 minutes in chat asking me to repeat my email address at least three times my home address at least three times and my name several times.. She could not see items in my cart so I had to send a screenshot of what I could see in my cart. I need her to do help me pay for my order and let me go on my way. Was useless after all the conversation, total waste of time, she says I can’t help you. You need to call the customer service line.  She disconnected me from the line ending the conversation and I could not proceed. I had to start all over again with another.</p>

      <h4>Chewy is the Best Corporation with the Best Customer Service, 5 stars (Apple App Store, 2024-09-04)</h4>
      <p>I have never had a problem or a bad experience in dealing with Chewy!  The Customer Service are absolutely fantastic!!  Mistakes happen, orders come late or sometimes are wrong but I have no problem calling Chewy customer support because I know the problem will be resolved immediately and they will always go the the extra mile to make sure their customers are completely satisfied, happy and never have to spend time on the phone with someone who is rude and reads from a binder refusing to help.  Amazon customer service could learn what true customer service is.  
On a personal note.  Earlier this year, my dog “Bo” was senselessly attacked and stabbed as a result.  His emergency vet bills were extremely expensive and I needed to cancel my Chewy Auto Ship.  It wasn’t caught in time and part of the order already was in transit.  The customer service team told me not to worry and just keep the item in transit.  I couldn’t believe the kindness and generosity of Chewy.  Thankfully my dog Bo recovered but it was a horrific experience.  
A few days after the incident, a package arrived from Chewy in the mail.  It was a Beautiful Get Well gift and Card for my dog Bo.  It had a lovely handwritten note and was personally signed by the customer care team.  Me and my family were and still are so grateful and deeply touched by such a wonderful gesture from a large corporation.

I hope the Corporate realizes how lucky they are to have such wonderful people who make an impact in a world where people like me have a lot of choices where we spend our money.  Since this incident, I recommend Chewy to everyone!  I work in animal rescue and constantly brag about your amazing people.  I know I am just one person but I would rather pay higher prices and have better service than deal with awful service, like Amazon for example.
Thank you</p>

When I’m trying to apply search filters, it applies them until a certain point, then randomly clears them all and I have to start all over to try to find what I’m looking for. It’s happened about 6 times in the last hour, so I’ll be trying to use the website instead. It also glitched and the app crashed entirely and restarted at one point.  Hoping the next update will be addressing these issues.</p>

      <p>Every company should take lessons from Chewy.  Every order received is exactly as I submitted it.  If there is a reason to exchange something because I’ve ordered the wrong size or style etc Chewy always has a suitable resolution.  If your pet doesn’t care for what you just ordered for them, just call Chewy and you will be amazed at how accommodating they are.  Don’t ever be afraid to try something out because should your pet stick their nose up at it and stare at you like “why did you order THAT for me….dont fret, Chewy has your back… just call them and they will make you and your pet happy again.  I highly recommend this company!!</p>

      <h4>Chewy is the best company out there!!, 5 stars (Clairedabanana, Apple App Store, 2024-08-19)</h4>
      <p>I just started using Chewy for my cat and when I signed up I received a hand written note welcoming me to the Chewy family. I started using them because I wanted to get my kitty a better quality food but she ended up not liking it and I was stuck with an un opened box. I used the chat in app to request a return which was answered almost immediately and was super easy to use. The woman who helped me (Kandace C.) was so nice and said that there was no need to ship anything back and to donate my extra food to a local shelter 🥹. I thought this was so cool and thoughtful and solidified my love for chewy. They are a really cool company and buying food on here is way easier and cheaper than in store and with auto ship it comes right when she is running low so there is no stress of having to make time to pick up more food. I could not recommend chewy enough. Truly a great company I will be using them for life!</p>

      <p>We love it when our chewy order arrives.  Our mum is happy too.  It saves her $$ so she can buy more treats for us 😸😸.  Saves hauling heavy bags of litter from store to car to home.  
Arrives at our house in a timely manner so that we don’t go hungry.  She also gets just enough friendly reminders from chewy about reordering everything we need.  Sometimes we even get toys to play with and we love our cat scratcher which saves the furnitures.  
Thank you Chewy from Harry 😻 and Polly😻</p>

      <p>I love Chewy as a company! I hear great stories about them and how much they actually care about pet owners. They have a super wide selection of items at good items and our kittens have loved everything from Chewy we’ve ordered. HOWEVER there is one glitch in the app that’s making it near impossible for me to use. Whenever you are browsing items and select one, once you go back to your search results, they’re gone and you have to do the search all over again. This happens when you click through their preset categories to browse too, every time you go in/out of an item it takes you back too far. Please fix this! It makes it so much harder to find what I’m looking for and you deserve 5 stars otherwise!</p>

      <h4>Great Customer Service, 5 stars (TwilightDoves, Apple App Store, 2024-08-08)</h4>
      <p>First time dog owner. I decided to give Chewy a try. They were recommended by a family member who has smaller exotic pets. First auto ship. My doggy HATED his food. 🤣 He barely tolerated the kibble that his shelter sent me home with. And he loved TikiDog wet food. But he wouldn’t touch the Tikidog dry lamb. I let Chewy know and they refunded me. I assumed they were then going to ask me to drop off the refunded product somewhere but instead they said to donate it to a shelter. So I did. Their chat service is very helpful. I even messaged them at midnight once because I kept forgetting to during the day and their response is fast. 

I’ve only had one order mess up in the 7 months I’ve been a customer. They had forgotten 2 items in my last auto ship. They apologized and overnighted the remaining items. Simba and I customers for life! 🥰</p>

      <p>My dog and I love Chewy. I love that they’re constantly adding new items, they have great sales, and their customer service is unmatched. 
My dog loves lick mats. So when I saw an option under the dog treat section to sort by “lickable treats” I was thrilled! I never know what to look up to find those sorts of treats to put on her lick mats. However, whenever you click on the link for lickable treats, it takes you to the section for “soft and chewy treats”. It’s almost like the lickable treat section wasn’t supposed to go live yet or something. I just wanted to bring it to the developers attention and hopefully get it resolved so my dog and I can make our next purchase!!</p>

      <p>It’s more than convenient. It’s turned out to be cheaper than going to the grocery store for me and when you have three dogs that weigh 100 pounds each or more the big bags are always on the bottom shelf and now they’re right on my porch.</p>

Exclusions apply, however it doesn’t list Purina Pro Plan as an exclusion- I am informed by the customer service agent that they are excluded. I see that Chewy has a promotion for a $30 ecard when I spend $100. My total in my cart was for $150 yet when I tried to use the promo code it said I didn’t have enough money spent to qualify. I’m done with the bait and switch that Chewy has been doing. I will get my products somewhere else.</p>

      <p>Chewy has been horrendous to work with for the past year. Time and time again our orders are being messed up, prescriptions are being delayed, charges are being doubled or tripled, and the representatives give nonsense excuses for why you aren’t getting your orders or the price of your order suddenly skyrocketed. This is the most trouble I’ve ever had with an online service. Every order, including autoships, I typically have to contact someone two times and the order is delayed by minimum a week and a half before it’s resolved. If I knew of other places to receive pet medications from I would switch, and I advise you to do the same.</p>

He was genuinely empathic, apologized for the issues and immediately assured me he would do everything he could to rectify the problem. Then he proceeded to do so. He had to get his supervisor involved, but ultimately expidited a new shipment while we were on the phone and issued a credit. Truly appreciate the sincere concern, taking ownership of the issue, and the resolution. This was a model of customer service excellence by Jeremy!</p>

      <h4>I present a scathing review, 1 stars (JöíFabü, Apple App Store, 2024-07-16)</h4>
      <p>Not only did Chewy lose a $100 sale with my most recent order that I canceled but they lost a years-long customer. Deleted the app itself off my phone and won’t use them again.

Went to order some dog food because I received a coupon in the mail. Normally I order my dog’s food with Amazon but I figured what the heck. So I placed the order thinking nothing of it. But then I get an email asking to verify that I made the transaction before they can fill it. They want me to jump through hoops with a long list of requested information to provide them to verify that I placed the order. Even though I was helped with their customer support team over the phone when placing the order!

I am not going to jump through hoops for anyone let alone when ordering my dog’s dog food. And the fact that I am NOT A NEW CUSTOMER but an established customer who has placed and received many orders over the last 5 years or so. But no more. Back to Amazon. You can keep your $15 coupon as the work you try to force customers to do is not worth the “savings”. Goodbye.</p>

When my sweet girl passed away, they sent a bouquet of flowers in remembrance of her. Chewy is the epitome of what great customer care looks like. If every company had such high quality of care for their patrons, customer service would no longer have such a terrible stigma of a headache that we consumers dread to deal with. Chewy, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Continue to pioneer the way of what real and great care looks like for your customers and future customers to come. I will always recommend Chewy to anyone with a pet/animal in their care. Chewy is the only way to go. Thank you, Chewy. ❤️</p>

      <h4>Generous and Caring, 5 stars (Rushed2Review, Apple App Store, 2024-06-28)</h4>
      <p>Can’t say that about a lot of retail/chain companies. They sent me a beautiful arrangement of plants after my 18 year old cat, Hunter Dean, passed away. 

Their pharmacy team always works hard to make sure their patients get the meds they need and patiently work with busy vets. They always have a kind and patient temperament. I always have a great chat with them. I really hope they keep their human workers because, honestly, it’s a huge strength for this company. The genuine, heartfelt empathy during my grief was welcome, especially in a world that doesn’t pause. 

If I’ve ever had a problem, they are quick to resolve it with sincerity and understanding. That’s so rare! 

I really enjoy the promo codes. It makes for a fun experience when shopping. I’ve gotten some really awesome products from them over the years and, more often than not, they’re providing better prices for new products. 

The auto ship feature is a godsend also. In the instance of owning a senior pet or a pet with special needs it brings a ton of peace to your world knowing it’ll come in regularly with little intervention on your part. And, because I also manage a stable of horses, I can focus on doing my job and I don’t have to rush to the vet for refills anymore. 

I really enjoy the personalized cards as well. They are fantastic and a fun thing to receive. 

Thank you Chewy!</p>

I get charged for my auto-ship when it’s out of stock and I contact customer service about it each time. They always say oh wait a few days so I do and I contact them again and then they say “it’s lost in transit”. Customer service has not been good at all lately. Auto ship became a pain.

      <p>Too expensive, they only offer free shipping if you spend 50$ plus.  On the other hand they are quick to ship.  Sometimes you get bad product however. Expired, dent wet food. Opened dog food.  They need to compete with Amazon on the likes if they want to stay in biz. Id pay a subscription to get a bigger discount on food and free shipping, no natter how small the order is.  10-12 subscription. 2day free shipping, why not? It works for everyone else..</p>

Auto ship is SUPER user friendly and should be the standard for apps wanting repeat shoppers on their platforms.

Gone are the days of making it to the store and hoping your pets stuff (the giant bugs of food or the “right” kind of wet food) is in stock. No more loading and unloading several times before having everything put away for daily use. 

Best thing I’ve done for myself and my pets. Saves time, saves money and my items come once a month or whenever I need to make an adjustment.</p>

… I forgot to update my address from 2019 — my new order went MIA to my old address.  

Chewy shipped me the case of stuff they had in stock and refunded me the other case that was out of stock.  And the customer service guy was a local with a good heart and a sound mind.  Not sure if I got lucky, or that’s just how Chewy does.  I’d have given them 5 stars if corporate America hadn’t conditioned me to be so untrusting</p>
