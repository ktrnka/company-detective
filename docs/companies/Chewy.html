      <p>i have been living in the Kansas City area for
The last 20 years, that is until recently when i moved back home to Upstate New York! When i say Upstate, i dont mean Warrick, West Point, or Albany! I mean a small town neqr Ogdensburg, which is about 40 mile from Ottawa, Canada! With this move I was worried about my fur babies being taken care of, well I was worried for no reason! CHEWY has not missed a beat, keeping up with the move and the Auto-ship orders! Nothing has fallen through the cracks! I highly recommend using Chewy for all your fur baby needs! My fur baby is one happy customer!</p>

      <p>Stop making your headline “$30 e-gift card if you spend $100” without including the very important detail that EXLUSIONS APPLY. The original headline is obviously meant to trick customers into thinking it is store wide. It’s ridiculous to have us waste our time shopping around for items just to realize we wasted our time when all items don’t even count for the discount. The correct headline ad should read “$30 e-gift card when you spend $100 on CERTAIN ITEMS” or at least include “exclusions apply” in the headline and not only when you click on it. Done with chewy cause this is the third time I’ve shopped around just to be tricked in the end. Goodbye. Amazon at least keeps it real… for the most part.</p>

      <h4>Doesn’t even work, 1 stars (Ethan N G, Apple App Store, 2024-11-08)</h4>
      <p>I have loved Chewy for almost 5 years. It was genuinely one of my favorite apps. Even if things were available on Amazon or at the pet store I would choose to order them on Chewy instead. But now the app won’t even work for me. I can browse and search for stuff, but as soon as I open my cart it says “error 503” so I’m unable to order anything. I tried a live chat to ask what I should do about the issue and it connected me with a Tiana B who was extremely rude. Then I found there was a phone number I could call. So I called the number, explained the issue and the man said he would send a message to their IT department to get the issue resolved which he said would take 24-48 hours. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now and it’s extremely frustrating because there are things I need to order for my dogs and it seems as though nobody is doing anything to try to resolve the issue and I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore, I might just have to uninstall the app if it won’t even work. And yes my app is updated, and no there is nothing wrong with my phone.</p>

I started using Chewy when I had very young children and was not about to lug 50 pound bags of cat litter and dog food to my apartment with a double stroller in tow . when a delivery is wrong they ask you to donate to needy pet or shelter. I love that too. They are five star in my opinion one of the best online services I’ve ever used.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using chewy auto ship for at least 4 years. Well that comes to an end today. When you set up items on auto ship…you start to notice when the bill is now $20 more than last time. Basically, make sure your auto ship is getting the auto ship discount every month on your items. 
I’ll be shopping locally. I don’t appreciate CHEWY playing in my face while they have my credit card info…then their chat agents act dense. I’m literally looking at the product and seeing the auto ship price wasn’t applied, although you already charged my card. Your shareholders can shove it.</p>

Why log in? You already get my account info via Apple Pay? And why log out in the first place?

Incidentally, the reason it took so long is the app loading painfully slow. It seems every screen change requires a round trip to the server. And often tapping a button does nothing or gives me “Oops. Something went wrong” error. 

Frankly, using the site is less painful.</p>

      <p>Today is January 29, 2025. My auto ship was December 31, 2024, it’s still not here. Nor is the replacement bag Chewy sent to my house because even with loads of evidence that FedEx has been doing a TERRIBLE job of delivering my dog food, Chewy still sent a replacement via FedEx. Finally I had the idea to have a bag sent to a different location, where I would pick it up. So they have successfully sent two bags of food to a location for me to pick up via FedEx, but the packages to my house have been ‘out for delivery’ so many days im about to block chewy emails because I get them every day that FedEx lied and says it’s out for delivery again only for FedEx to not show up and then put in the system that I requested a future delivery date, which is also a lie. Chewy knows this, knows I now have to drive an hour to pick up food that I buy because it is supposed to be conveniently left at my door. I am so done with Chewy. I’ve talked to so many people that work there and only one ever followed up. Chewy’s script they give their employees is full of warm words, but warm words don’t give my dogs warm, full, tummies. I guess Chewy is finally like every other big company, people like me are ‘built in loss’ thats expected, what do they care, Chewy will still make loads of money this year. I am just one customer they lost, no big deal. But I will definitely be telling everyone I know to avoid them.</p>

Not only are they a great company in general, but their customer service department is top notch. They’ve helped me multiple times with returns or any issues that I’ve had (which hasn’t been many), but they also sent me a heartfelt card with a small vase of flowers to my apartment after my dear sweet Gypsy passed. What a sweet and thoughtful company. I will never stop using Chewy for multiple reasons, but having a company that is empathetic and has a human touch is something that will keep me as a lifelong customer of theirs!

      <h4>accessibility issues with the app, 1 stars (Callucin, Apple App Store, 2024-11-19)</h4>
      <p>Hello. I am a Chewy customer who is blind. I use the VoiceOver screen reader on my iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.0.1. The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?</p>

      <h4>All great, chewy not so much, 1 stars (Lilmamasteeda, Apple App Store, 2025-01-08)</h4>
      <p>I am over chewy. I stopped using them last time for the same reason. I ordered food for my animals on January 5th and I won’t be getting it till the 15th?!?!  So much for promised 3 days shipping. I don’t want to have to order that far in advance so wont be using them once I get this bag of food. They have never been good to me. Never</p>
