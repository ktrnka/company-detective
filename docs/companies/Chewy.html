        <h1>About Chewy</h1>
<p>Chewy, Inc. is a prominent American online retailer specializing in pet food and supplies. The company was founded on June 1, 2011, by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day. Chewy is headquartered in Plantation, Florida, and has grown significantly since its inception, becoming a major player in the e-commerce pet industry. In 2017, Chewy was acquired by PetSmart for $3.35 billion, marking the largest acquisition of an e-commerce business at that time [(Wikipedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company).</p>
<p>As of 2021, Chewy employed over 18,000 people in the United States [(Wikipedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company). The company reported net sales of $11.15 billion in fiscal year 2023, reflecting a 10.2% year-over-year growth <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>. Chewy's business model is primarily B2C, catering to pet owners by offering a wide range of pet-related products and services through its retail websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Chewy's product offerings include approximately 115,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) from over 3,500 brands. The company is known for its Autoship program, which allows customers to receive regular shipments of pet food and supplies, significantly contributing to its revenue <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/09/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-chewy-vs-freshpet/">(Fool, 2024-11-09)</a>. Additionally, Chewy has expanded into pet healthcare services with the launch of Chewy Vet Care, which includes veterinary clinics offering routine check-ups and urgent care <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>

Chewy fosters a culture of innovation, passion, and commitment to pet welfare, encouraging its employees to be creative and proactive in their roles.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Sumit Singh has served as CEO of Chewy since March 2018, succeeding co-founder Ryan Cohen. Singh has emphasized the importance of operational discipline and customer-centric strategies in driving the company's growth. In a recent earnings call, he stated, “Our third quarter results continued to build on the positive momentum we observed in Q2” <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Financial Performance and Market Position</h2>
<p>In its Q3 2024 earnings report, Chewy achieved a 4.8% year-over-year increase in net sales, totaling $2.88 billion. The company reported a gross margin of 29.3%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA of $138.2 million, up $55.7 million from the previous year <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>. Despite these positive results, the number of active customers declined by 0.5% to 20.2 million, raising concerns about customer retention <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>
<p>Chewy faces challenges, including increased competition from major players like Amazon and PetSmart. Retail experts have noted that while Chewy has built a loyal customer base, its recent growth rates may not meet investor expectations, leading to fluctuations in share value <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>. Additionally, the decline in active customers and rising operating expenses pose potential risks to the company's future growth <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/chewy-quarterly-sales/">(Bloomberg News, 2024-12-06)</a>.</p>
<h2>Strategic Initiatives and Innovations</h2>
<p>Chewy has focused on enhancing customer experience through improved site and app functionalities, which have reportedly led to a mid-teens boost in unique customers and average monthly app users compared to the previous year <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-updated-experiences-active-customers-membership-q3/735183/">(Retail Dive, 2024-12-12)</a>. The company is also investing in its Chewy+ membership program, which offers perks such as free returns and 24/7 customer service, aiming to drive sales and customer loyalty <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/chewy-updated-experiences-active-customers-membership-q3/735183/">(Retail Dive, 2024-12-12)</a>.</p>
<h2>Recent Analyst Reports</h2>
<p>Chewy has been highlighted in several recent analyst reports as a top pick for 2025. Analysts have expressed optimism about Chewy's potential for significant growth, with some predicting over 50% upside in a bull case scenario <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/01/42838953/chewy-set-to-see-13-upside-as-mizuho-upgrades-raises-price-target-sees-pet-industry-recovery-and-growth-drivers-for-2025">(Kaustubh Bagalkote, 2025-01-07)</a>. Mizuho and BofA have included Chewy in their top e-commerce picks, citing an improved consumer backdrop and strategic initiatives as key factors for potential success <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mizuho-refreshes-its-us-top-picks-list-for-january-3802436">(Vahid Karaahmetovic, 2025-01-08)</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4392637-amazon-chewy-and-rh-are-top-e-commerce-picks-at-bofa">(Clark Schultz, 2025-01-06)</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Chewy, Inc. remains a dominant force in the pet e-commerce market, with a robust business model and a loyal customer base. However, the company must navigate challenges related to customer retention and competition to sustain its growth trajectory. Investors and prospective candidates should consider both the opportunities and risks associated with Chewy's current market position and strategic initiatives.</p>

      <h4>accessibility issues with the app, 1 stars (Callucin, Apple App Store, 2024-11-19)</h4>
      <p>Hello. I am a Chewy customer who is blind. I use the VoiceOver screen reader on my iPhone 15 Pro running iOS 18.0.1. The latest version of your app has basically rendered the app useless to screen reader user, such as myself. In the past, I have been able to use the app without any issues. However, now it is impossible for me to search for items, get details on items, add items to my basket without calling your customer service phone number. This is something I prefer not to do. per the ADA, your app needs to be made accessible for all users, no matter the disability. Your customer care team has been wonderful, but. my having to call customer care to look for items and place an order does not put me on equal footing with everyone else. Could the developers, please, please look into fixing the accessibility problems with the app?</p>

The way your order information is displayed on the screen. It looks like on one page shows it being deducted, then it looks like it’s being added back on on the final page.

 I don’t know what idiots they have in their IT department, but my personal opinion is a drunken 12-year-old could design their webpages in a more understandable manner!</p>

      <h4>What has happened to Chewy????, 3 stars (Smart cat lady, Apple App Store, 2024-11-19)</h4>
      <p>I have used Chewy for years now, the customer service is not what it was when I started using them. Can never get a delivery consistently to my front porch, twice the box has been left just inside my gate, between 2 sprinkler heads. The Ring did not go off because they couldn’t be bothered to bring it to the front porch, when I found it in the morning, the box was soaked with water. There was as a big tear in a bag of cat food that was now a soggy, disgusting mess. So today I tried to add 3 items to my autoship, but the system created a new autoship, I don’t want 2, I am unable to add these items to my original autoship, ridiculous!
Now I have to get on the phone to see if they can fix this. Why is this happening at all? I shouldn’t have to call twice to get help. Every month it’s some new problem. I’m looking for a different provider that has great customer service.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using chewy auto ship for at least 4 years. Well that comes to an end today. When you set up items on auto ship…you start to notice when the bill is now $20 more than last time. Basically, make sure your auto ship is getting the auto ship discount every month on your items. 
I’ll be shopping locally. I don’t appreciate CHEWY playing in my face while they have my credit card info…then their chat agents act dense. I’m literally looking at the product and seeing the auto ship price wasn’t applied, although you already charged my card. Your shareholders can shove it.</p>

We have used chewy almost exclusively for all of our wet/dry food, supplements, toys, etc. The customer service is top tier, and the only time we ever received any incorrect items (auto ship dog food) they sent a replacement bag, issued a partial refund for us to be able to buy a small bag to last until our shipment came in, and told us to donate the bag of food that was incorrect!

We LOVE chewy and it is a must have for busy and/or forgetful pet owners! Our dog even knows what the chewy boxes look like and gets excited knowing those are for him!</p>

      <p>Most features on the app are great except a few things. I can’t easily share items with other people, would be nice to have a button to share the item with a friend. Also needs a place to see all current placed orders. I have to go on my desktop to see them on my dashboard; don’t think there’s a dashboard feature on the app.</p>

      <p>I’ve been a loyal Chewy customer, ordering pet food multiple times through the app. While I initially appreciated the convenience and reputation of Chewy, I’ve grown increasingly frustrated with their verification process.

Every single time I place an order, I’m asked to verify my information, which often leads to lengthy phone calls and unnecessary delays. I’ve been patient, thinking this was a one-time issue or part of their commitment to security, but it happens every time.

For a company that prides itself on customer service, this repeated inconvenience feels excessive and unprofessional. It’s disappointing because I trust Chewy to care about pets and their owners, but this constant hurdle makes me reconsider whether I want to keep using their service.</p>

      <p>I have loved Chewy for almost 5 years. It was genuinely one of my favorite apps. Even if things were available on Amazon or at the pet store I would choose to order them on Chewy instead. But now the app won’t even work for me. I can browse and search for stuff, but as soon as I open my cart it says “error 503” so I’m unable to order anything. I tried a live chat to ask what I should do about the issue and it connected me with a Tiana B who was extremely rude. Then I found there was a phone number I could call. So I called the number, explained the issue and the man said he would send a message to their IT department to get the issue resolved which he said would take 24-48 hours. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now and it’s extremely frustrating because there are things I need to order for my dogs and it seems as though nobody is doing anything to try to resolve the issue and I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore, I might just have to uninstall the app if it won’t even work. And yes my app is updated, and no there is nothing wrong with my phone.</p>

      <p>I’ve always used Chewy for my multiple pets over the years simply because they had a great selection of pet supplies and I can conveniently have things auto shipped to me for a small discount and I don’t have to remember to order the essentials all the time. Not only are they a great company in general, but their customer service department is top notch. They’ve helped me multiple times with returns or any issues that I’ve had (which hasn’t been many), but they also sent me a heartfelt card with a small vase of flowers to my apartment after my dear sweet Gypsy passed. What a sweet and thoughtful company. I will never stop using Chewy for multiple reasons, but having a company that is empathetic and has a human touch is something that will keep me as a lifelong customer of theirs! Thank you for being amazing 💜 (shout out to Ayla in the customer service department specifically for making this happen. You are a wonderful person!)</p>

      <h4>Shipping issues, 1 stars (Bethanykent, Apple App Store, 2024-12-04)</h4>
      <p>I have had nothing but problems with chewys prescription shipping processes. All one shipping process. My dog had been without his pills for 7-9 days...on several occasions. Due to issues and being delayed. I'd like to mention I order over a week early also. Not everyone has the money to order expensive pills...immediately after they order the one they just received?!
They need more shipping options. 
PETMEDS is better.</p>

      <h4>Ordering, 5 stars (Summervillesue, Apple App Store, 2025-01-05)</h4>
      <p>It is easy to order from the app and if I have a question, I call them and all my questions answered. 

If I decide not to use the app, I pick up the phone, I call them and they are so helpful and they take my order.

      <h4>Great customer service, 5 stars (2 cats 2 dogz, Apple App Store, 2025-01-11)</h4>
      <p>This morning I called customer service to notify Chewy of the passing of my youngest cat. Lydia ( I hope I have the name right) was so kind and patient. She made changes to my information and helped me find the new canned food for my dogs.</p>

      <h4>Promos don’t work, 2 stars (The first snow, Apple App Store, 2025-01-04)</h4>
      <p>I’ve encountered so many promo codes, even on the website, and not a single one has worked—including ones that were advertised WITH the item I tried to use it with! 

I feel like they do it to entice you to put things in your cart, assuming once you realize the code doesn’t work you’re likely to make the purchase anyway since you’re already there.

Just a guess but I wouldn’t put it past any company. Regardless, that’s been my experience thus far.</p>
