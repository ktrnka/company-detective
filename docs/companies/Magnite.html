<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Great looks, 4* crash test safety rating, one of the lowest-priced full automatics, spacious cabin, powerful engine because of the turbo.

<li>"We have XV CVT which we bought around launch and it's an excellent car for the price. The only thing I don't like is the plastic quality of some interior bits like the indoor lamps, IRVM etc. Other than that, it ticks all boxes for us." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/comments/16pzu6v/my_father_is_buying_nissan_magnite/k1u8tle/">(SierraRomeo, Reddit, 2023-09-23)</a></li>
