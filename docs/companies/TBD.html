        <h2>Company TBD</h2>
<h3>General Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"TBD is short for 'To Be Determined'. The joke in the game is that while its creators were trying to think of a better name, they used TBD as a placeholder." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1f0c7em/tbd_what_it_means/ljquba0/">(CapnSmite, Reddit, 2024-08-24)</a></li>
<li>"It is one of the Indie Feds of 2K, the name means nothing because Cap and Geneva Rose couldn't come up with one." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1f0c7em/tbd_what_it_means/ljry55j/">(slacboy101, Reddit, 2024-08-24)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I got the tbd email too. I was already pissed off with them not honoring the coupon for the free case along with the buds, but this whole situation is just so irritating." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/lf93mz4/">(lf93mz4, Reddit, 2024-07-27)</a></li>
<li>"I just got this email, worst part is the preview in the notification panel of my phone says 'Your Order Is Ready For Pickup!' and then the message is about the delay lol." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leul0pr/">(leul0pr, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
<li>"I don't mind the delay, I'm just wishing they'd give us more info on the delay." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leulkue/">(leulkue, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
<li>"I cancelled my preorder yesterday due to these delays and the issues described in this sub." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leuk9rk/">(leuk9rk, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I pre ordered and received my bud 3 pro silver 7/20/24. No QC issues on mine. I'm in California." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/letz6o3/">(letz6o3, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
<li>"I ordered mine directly from samsung, had them about an hour before I asked for a return label. They literally balance in your ear and will fall out with the slightest movement." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leu9gg5/">(leu9gg5, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
<li>"I got mine yesterday and they are mintðŸ‘Œ" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/lf43f0h/">(lf43f0h, Reddit, 2024-07-26)</a></li>
<li>"I should be grateful I got my fold 6 days earlier before today. People are having delays with theirs I'm loving mine." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/letetb6/">(let40y6, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Product TBD</h2>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I would be thrilled if this means they're working on a way for people who bought the game + DLC already on Wii U to get some kind of a discount." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de66imm/">(dangerskew, Reddit, 2017-02-24)</a></li>
<li>"As far as I know, I'm not rebuying this game for $60, just for 6 characters and a battle mode. They better make it $40. Or something like that." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6abvz/">(ThaRoastKing, Reddit, 2017-02-24)</a></li>
<li>"I think that's the problem here. People like you are seeing a $60 price tag for not nearly that much increased content, while Nintendo knows there are people like me who never bought it and are getting more than $60 of value considering the DLC for just the $60 base price." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6j8hn/">(hiperson134, Reddit, 2017-02-25)</a></li>
<li>"It's essentially a rehash plus a few more features. Nintendo didn't have to do much programming or put many resources into porting this to the Switch. Full price @ $59.99 seems like way too much for a port." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de696ss/">(JAKE-OB, Reddit, 2017-02-24)</a></li>
<li>"Full price is simply too much if this indeed is a blunt port with only the new battle mode and Splatoon characters." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de76mrz/">(Kenshin0011, Reddit, 2017-02-25)</a></li>
<li>"I would buy this if the price was at $40." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de78sbo/">(IHeartCake69, Reddit, 2017-02-25)</a></li>
<li>"I never bought a Wii U so 59.99 is fine but I already pre ordered it on prime and I am getting it for 50 but I really hope people who bought the game on Wii U gets a discount." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6t8ba/">(DrewSaga, Reddit, 2017-02-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Development and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love TBD and so long as people are consistently pushing to the main trunk branch it immensely cuts back on merge conflicts!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9pqf22/">(WaddlesJr, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"It allows QA to sign off multiple things at once, no feature branches being deployed and overwriting stuff, you can redeploy and know that you'll not take Dave's feature out with Andy's, no second round of QA post merge in case the merge was dodgy or stepped on other toes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9slr5u/">(stedgyson, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"We've been doing what is described in the article for over a year and honestly it's amazing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9rak3l/">(stedgyson, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"I think it's a purist argument to say you have to use no branches." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qdz4f/">(BandicootGood5246, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"I don't understand how purist TBD manage to maintain a quality codebase without pull-requests and code reviews." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9sdeeg/">(lIIllIIlllIIllIIl, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
