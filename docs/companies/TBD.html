        <h1>About TBD</h1>
<p>TBD was founded on July 1, 2021 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tbd-0881">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. The company was involved in the development of decentralized identity solutions, contributing foundational components under the Web5 umbrella to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). This indicates a focus on decentralized technologies and identity solutions. The company has officially wound down its business operations, transitioning several of its primitives and tools to the open-source community. This move suggests that their products were primarily aimed at developers and organizations interested in decentralized identity solutions (TBD Website).</p>
<p>Due to the transition to open-source, specific customer information is not provided, but the tools and primitives were likely targeted at a B2B audience, particularly developers and organizations in the tech industry. The company's revenue and scale, including the number of employees and customers, are not detailed in the available sources.</p>
<p>TBD's products were distributed through open-source channels, allowing developers to continue building on their work. This reflects a culture of collaboration and community support, aiming to empower developers and foster innovation in decentralized technologies (TBD Website).</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>The available information does not provide details about the leadership team or key personnel at TBD. This lack of information makes it difficult to provide insights into the company's leadership structure or notable quotes from executives.</p>
