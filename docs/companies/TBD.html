        <h1>About TBD</h1>
<p>TBD was founded on July 1, 2021 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tbd-0881">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. The company has recently wound down its business operations, transitioning several of its primitives and tools to the open-source community. This move reflects a commitment to ensuring that developers can continue to build upon their work, particularly in the area of decentralized identity <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/hacktoberfest-2024/">(Home, TBD, 2024-10-12)</a>.</p>
<p>TBD was involved in decentralized identity work and contributed foundational components developed under the Web5 umbrella to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). The company did not specify particular customers, as its focus shifted towards open-source contributions. The scale of the company, including the number of employees and revenue, is not detailed in the available sources.</p>
<p>The company's products and services were likely related to identity verification or management, aligning with trends in technology that emphasize user privacy and data security. The distribution of these products is now primarily through open-source channels, allowing developers to access and build upon the tools provided by TBD.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>The available information does not provide details about the leadership team or key personnel at TBD. However, the strategic decision to transition to open-source contributions suggests a leadership team that is forward-thinking and aligned with current technological trends.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Business Wind Down</h2>

This decision may impact any ongoing projects or partnerships and reflects a strategic pivot towards supporting decentralized identity work <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/hacktoberfest-2024/">(Home, TBD, 2024-10-12)</a>.</p>
<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
<p>The company has contributed foundational components to the open-source community, particularly in decentralized identity. This move may attract developers interested in building on these tools and aligns with the company's commitment to fostering development in decentralized technologies <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/hacktoberfest-2024/">(Home, TBD, 2024-10-12)</a>.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>TBD is currently in a state of transition, having wound down its previous business operations and shifted focus towards open-source contributions in decentralized identity. This pivot may position the company favorably within the tech community, particularly among developers interested in privacy and security solutions. However, prospective candidates and investors should remain cautious and monitor further developments regarding the company's future direction and product offerings.</p>

        <h2>COMPANY TBD</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love TBD and so long as people are consistently pushing to the main trunk branch it immensely cuts back on merge conflicts!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9pqf22/">(WaddlesJr, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"We've been doing what is described in the article for over a year and honestly it's amazing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9rak3l/">(stedgyson, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"It allows QA to sign off multiple things at once, no feature branches being deployed and overwriting stuff, you can redeploy and know that you'll not take Dave's feature out with Andy's." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9slr5u/">(stedgyson, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Neutral/Constructive Criticism</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I think strict TBD doesn't work very well for non-cloud programs and non-web apps." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9q6hg9/">(fishling, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"I don't understand how purist TBD manage to maintain a quality codebase without pull-requests and code reviews." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9sdeeg/">(lIIllIIlllIIllIIl, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"I think it's a purist argument to say you have to use no branches." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qdz4f/">(BandicootGood5246, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"If anything, scaled TBD seems like a weird thing, because it stresses that branches are for a single developer only." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9rty5t/">(fishling, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>
<li>"What also cuts it back is occasionally merging from trunk to my branch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qh12q/">(goranlepuz, Reddit, 2023-11-18)</a></li>

<li>"I ordered mine directly from samsung, had them about an hour before I asked for a return label. They literally balance in your ear and will fall out with the slightest movement." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leu9gg5/">(pursut2, Reddit, 2024-07-25)</a></li>
