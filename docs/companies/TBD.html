        <h1>About TBD</h1>
<p>TBD is a business unit under Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.), established in 2021. The company is dedicated to creating a decentralized future, focusing on empowering individuals with control over their finances, data, and identity. TBD's mission is to build an inclusive financial ecosystem using open-source protocols and standards, addressing the needs of the 1.7 billion adults globally who lack access to banking systems. The company operates in the financial technology sector, offering products and services that enhance financial access and identity management.</p>
<p>TBD's key projects include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Web5</strong>: A decentralized platform that introduces a new identity layer for the web, enabling decentralized applications (DWAs) and protocols. It emphasizes self-sovereign identity (SSI), allowing users to manage their data independently of centralized entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tbDEX</strong>: An open protocol designed to facilitate liquidity and trust in financial transactions, connecting legacy currencies to digital currencies without centralized intermediaries. It uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to enhance security and compliance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>TBD serves a diverse range of customers, including individuals, businesses, institutions, and governments. The company fosters a collaborative and inclusive culture, encouraging contributions from a global community of developers and innovators.
