        <h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Pricing</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I stopped using it because it's prohibitively expensive, and also because they don't value your privacy in the slightest (they reserve the right to look at literally anything you are writing and have full access to it)." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kd5q57h/">(paranoidletter17, Reddit, 2023-12-13)</a></li>
<li>"As for the new pricing, it's scandalous." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kd5q57h/">(paranoidletter17, Reddit, 2023-12-13)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is too expensive. It's like 20 bucks a month for only 30,000 words. Should be flat fee for unlimited words." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/js2bcil/">(LordShozin6, Reddit, 2023-07-15)</a></li>
<li>"I agree that their allowed number of words is somewhat low and it turns out too expensive for any serious writing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/iitwg7n/">(Kellin01, Reddit, 2022-08-03)</a></li>
<li>"I would be a paying customer if they still charged $20 for an unlimited plan." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/j7rwuet/">(mazz6969, Reddit, 2023-02-08)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite cost of prompts seem to be inflated to the extreme." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldfuq2o/">(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I thought it was better 3-4 months ago, and now it's hot garbage, not sure there if there is any value at all to it regardless of how they price it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kdp2nc1/">(fuf3d, Reddit, 2023-12-17)</a></li>
<li>"Most prompts just stall and don't do anything. Others are fragmented lines that don't even make sense or change the context completely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdtteq0/">(Qomplete, Reddit, 2023-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I just tried to write a murder scene for my sci-fi/horror novel and Sudowrite responded with: I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable continuing a story containing graphic depictions of violence." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kdymc1u/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-18)</a></li>
<li>"I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective... Immediately, it got it wrong." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
<li>"The whole rewrite is much more miss than hit. I get 85% results of nonsense, some derail, some are plainly the opposite of what I want." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3dy9d2/">(NoalFey, Reddit, 2023-10-04)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite can do a lot of things well, but a variety of styles isn't one of them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/ki9qmw7/">(paranoidletter17, Reddit, 2024-01-17)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback on Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I found it was better for small chunks that I just didn't want to write, like describe a big room with a door at the end, but it's novel generator bit wasn't great." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kfdfvkf/">(More-Employment7504, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>
<li>"I kind of liked aspects of SW when I started using it, especially the ability to add characters, tone, beats etc and generate chapters but the novelty soon wears off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kdbkyf0/">(GravelMonkey01, Reddit, 2023-12-14)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite is IMO a superior product in many ways, but as you said...The pricing is completely insane." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/">(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Positive Feedback on Usability</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/">(ednever, Reddit, 2022-05-05)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own, but I really LOVE the ability to give it an outline and letting it expand that into prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>
<li>"I did the Sudowrite trial and was extremely impressed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/jfe0eby/">(YsCrackNsnickerdudeL, Reddit, 2023-04-08)</a></li>
<li>"Good news, I found the censor function can be turned off. Sudowrite just doesn't make it obvious how to do it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/keczoej/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-21)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: User Experience Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/">(superamit, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"I find Sudowrite's website horrible on mobile devices or tablets." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/jc9guk5/">(99-Sunshine, Reddit, 2023-03-15)</a></li>
<li>"I literally could have spent 5 hours knocking out 3k words rather than wrestling with an AI to get the first 500 words right." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kha6brp/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is so helter skelter and childishly designed. It’s not ready for prime time. It shouldn’t cost what it does considering how non-user friendly it is either." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/l1wc77a/">(No-Type5536, Reddit, 2024-04-30)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Comparisons to Competitors</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Sudo's new pricing looks exactly like NovelCrafter's platform where you pick your AI platforms when you generate words - just like NovelCrafter. But Sudo charges twice as much for it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kff8fp7/">(Minimum_Spell_2553, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>
<li>"Overall, I'd say NovelAI is the best all-rounder. It's cheaper for heavy users since there's no character limit, but you do sometimes need to get a little more into the settings and lore memory to get results you like." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"I, and at least a dozen I know of, have switched to using novelcrafter.com. It's free in beta right now and then $14 a month." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/kda6cc1/">(yankeecandle1, Reddit, 2023-12-14)</a></li>
