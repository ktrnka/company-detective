<h3>Impressive Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite is best in class for high-volume, quality output with minimal tweaking, and a useful, very intuitive writing toolset." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is a great place to start if you have a basic idea of what you like in a story. They have loads of toys to play with where you plug in a basic idea for a character, place, or story and see what it will create, tweak it a little, and keep going." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1fvkbhr/what_does_sudowrite_and_novelcrafter_actually_do/lq9c2b6/">(PiccoloGold3510, Reddit, 2024-10-04)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite connects with LLMs without you having to integrate them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1fvkbhr/what_does_sudowrite_and_novelcrafter_actually_do/lq7qfjx/">(akisomething, Reddit, 2024-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite has its own LMM which they supposedly optimize for generating prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1fvkbhr/what_does_sudowrite_and_novelcrafter_actually_do/lq8bznb/">(ZobeidZuma, Reddit, 2024-10-04)</a></li>
<li>"I love Sudo. It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3cufnw/">(GlitteringKisses, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite seems to be the only AI tool that can create content that could easily pass for an actual novel." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3codl8/">(WGW30, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite packs in a ton of features to boost your writing, which can be a lot to take in." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/m57116a/">(deadfantasy, Reddit, 2025-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I did the Sudowrite trial and was extremely impressed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/jfe0eby/">(jfe0eby, Reddit, 2023-04-08)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>User-Friendly</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite is just more simple for noobies like me." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/lddtb8n/">(None, Reddit, 2024-07-16)</a></li>
<li>"Just started using Sudowrite and find it extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own, but I really LOVE the ability to give it an outline and letting it expand that into prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback</h2>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite is really impressive but monetize method is really greedy. I'd be happy to subscribe if there weren't a words limit." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kpb7cla/">(21limo, Reddit, 2024-02-07)</a></li>
<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load. After trying and waiting for a few hours, I requested help. Got an email asking me if I still wanted help. I replied and the only other email I get is one asking if I received the email. My subsequent email replies have gone unanswered. I am feeling very frustrated and rebuffed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kv497d9/">(Additional_Buddy7020, Reddit, 2024-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is too expensive. It's like 20 bucks a month for only 30,000 words. Should be flat fee for unlimited words." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/js2bcil/">(LordShozin6, Reddit, 2023-07-15)</a></li>
<li>"I agree that their allowed number of words is somewhat low and it turns out too expensive for any serious writing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/iitwg7n/">(Kellin01, Reddit, 2022-08-03)</a></li>
<li>"I think Sudowrite is a superior product in many ways, but the pricing is completely insane." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/">(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Something major changed on the platform a short while ago... Most prompts just stall and don't do anything. Others are fragmented lines that don't even make sense or change the context completely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdtteq0/">(Qomplete, Reddit, 2023-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I had a similar experience with SudoWrite. It used to be better, but now it's totally oblivious to instructions and the content/style of the prompt." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh9yq9p/">(One_West503, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
<li>"I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective... Immediately, it got it wrong." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback</h2>
<h3>Censorship and Content Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite now actively refuses to generate depending on what you write and even threatens account removal. Avoid this service if you value a censorship free service." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/">(AstorSigma, Reddit, 2023-03-08)</a></li>
<li>"I feel your pain! It keeps doing the same thing to me!!!! It said I was violating content with sexual content about minors when there are no minors being mentioned and the two characters having sex are both overage!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k0etloi/">(bre2123, Reddit, 2023-09-13)</a></li>
<li>"Good news, I found the censor function can be turned off. Sudowrite just doesn't make it obvious how to do it. You have to go into SETTINGS and switch the AI to UNFILTERED." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/keczoej/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-21)</a></li>
<li>"For the last several days I've received various apologies from the AI... Some of them say that there are consent issues when there are none." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kfgy73g/">(Welsh_Bard, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have mixed results. The whole rewrite is much more miss than hit. I get 85% results of nonsense." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3dy9d2/">(NoalFey, Reddit, 2023-10-04)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite can do a lot of things well, but a variety of styles isn't one of them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/ki9qmw7/">(paranoidletter17, Reddit, 2024-01-17)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is so helter skelter and childishly designed. It’s not ready for prime time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/l1wc77a/">(No-Type5536, Reddit, 2024-04-30)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: General Observations</h2>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"With Sudowrite I always feel like there's a lot of friction as I struggle to get it to do what I want." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp92468/">(ZobeidZuma, Reddit, 2024-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite gave really good results but I had trouble getting used to it initially." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/kwtpboi/">(inkrosw115, Reddit, 2024-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I literally only just got started, but already I’m feeling a bit <em>ugh</em> about the whole thing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison with Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"Honestly, I can't confirm any of this. Sudowrite is still far superior to any alternative for story writing and it never balks, even at the most graphic scenes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jh4ls40/">(Odd-Cat-5650, Reddit, 2023-04-21)</a></li>
<li>"I currently use NovelAI as my writing companion simply because I feel safe from prying eyes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/j6ar4wt/">(None, Reddit, 2023-01-29)</a></li>
