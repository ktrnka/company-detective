<ul>
<li>"I love Sudo. It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3cufnw/">(GlitteringKisses, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite has made many changes including expanding the story bible to include better character bios." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/">(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)</a></li>
<li>"I was able to link my existing chapters to the outline and then... I used the generate chapter feature." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/">(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite helped me fix my plot and now I'm writing it on my own at the same rapid pace I wrote the first book in the series." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/">(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)</a></li>
<li>"I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/">(ednever, Reddit, 2022-05-05)</a></li>
<li>"Just started using Sudowrite and find it extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own, but I really LOVE the ability to give it an outline and letting it expand that into prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>
<li>"I did the Sudowrite trial and was extremely impressed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/jfe0eby/">(YsCrackNsnickerdudeL, Reddit, 2023-04-08)</a></li>

<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I have mixed results. The whole rewrite is much more miss than hit. I get 85% results of nonsense." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3dy9d2/">(NoalFey, Reddit, 2023-10-04)</a></li>
<li>"People get more and more heavily into complex headers and guardrails and style guide and beats and genre, but the output still has 'that AI feel'." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3cufnw/">(GlitteringKisses, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>

<li>"I found Sudowrite gave really good results but I had trouble getting used to it initially. It’s great for beginners, but getting good results takes some tinkering in the beginning." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/kwrwm1u/">(inkrosw115, Reddit, 2024-03-27)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite is so helter skelter and childishly designed. It’s not ready for prime time. It shouldn’t cost what it does considering how non-user friendly it is either." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/l1wc77a/">(No-Type5536, Reddit, 2024-04-30)</a></li>

<li>"I don't like how SW doesn't roll credits over. That's a big problem for a lot of the users and why so many move on." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lohnjw7/">(coolpop78, Reddit, 2024-09-23)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is too expensive. It's like 20 bucks a month for only 30,000 words. Should be flat fee for unlimited words." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/js2bcil/">(LordShozin6, Reddit, 2023-07-15)</a></li>

<h2>Usability and Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite packs in a ton of features to boost your writing, which can be a lot to take in." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/m31oj3v/">(m31oj3v, Reddit, 2024-12-20)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite uses a credit system; each AI feature uses up some credits." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/m31oj3v/">(m31oj3v, Reddit, 2024-12-20)</a></li>
<li>"I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective... Immediately, it got it wrong." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
<li>"It started writing in the first person for the wrong character.

<li>"I’ve used a fair few generative AI tools, and what I’m used to is them taking the backstory/permanent memory/definitions etc., and then the <em>context</em> of what’s been written... But Sudowrite seemed to just… ignore me?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
