<h3>Product Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite is by far the best AI writing tool, but it is so damn expensive." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/">(WGW30, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/">(ednever, Reddit, 2022-05-05)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own, but I really LOVE the ability to give it an outline and letting it expand that into prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>
<li>"I did the Sudowrite trial and was extremely impressed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/jfe0eby/">(YsCrackNsnickerdudeL, Reddit, 2023-04-08)</a></li>
<li>"In sudowrite, when I used their AI, it follows through with her character with thorough descriptions..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgo75jn/">(PortaSponge, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>
<li>"Even on the $10 plan for Sudowrite you can get a whole lot written using the new Chat4o Mini model. It’s a great way to get a ton of value." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgqdlit/">(deadfantasy, Reddit, 2024-08-06)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback</h2>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite is an overpriced, lesser version of Novelcrafter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp8vlxq/">(Clueless_Nooblet, Reddit, 2024-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite's biggest downside is that it's less flexible and customizable, and far more expensive per generation than Novelcrafter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/l6a4j3l/">(waker1771, Reddit, 2024-05-30)</a></li>
<li>"I think I’ve found a major flaw in how it generates stories, and I’m worried I might now be stuck without erasing everything and starting again." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kha7mdd/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite is IMO a superior product in many ways, but as you said...The pricing is completely insane. A straight rip off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/">(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load. After trying and waiting for a few hours, I requested help. Got an email asking me if I still wanted help. I replied and the only other email I get is one asking if I received the email. My subsequent email replies have gone unanswered. I am feeling very frustrated and rebuffed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/">(Thewrightrae_5591, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Something major changed on the platform a short while ago... Most prompts just stall and don't do anything. Others are fragmented lines that don't even make sense or change the context completely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdtteq0/">(Qomplete, Reddit, 2023-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"The whole rewrite is much more miss than hit. I get 85% results of nonsense, some derail, some are plainly the opposite of what I want." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3dy9d2/">(NoalFey, Reddit, 2023-10-04)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback</h2>
<h3>Usability and Flexibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>"With Sudowrite I always feel like there's a lot of friction as I struggle to get it to do what I want." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp92468/">(ZobeidZuma, Reddit, 2024-02-06)</a></li>
<li>"I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective... Immediately, it got it wrong." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>
<li>"I had a similar experience with SudoWrite. It used to be better, but now it's totally oblivious to instructions and the content/style of the prompt." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh9yq9p/">(One_West503, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Content Generation Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, I can't confirm any of this. Sudowrite is still far superior to any alternative for story writing and it never balks, even at the most graphic scenes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jh4ls40/">(Odd-Cat-5650, Reddit, 2023-04-21)</a></li>
<li>"I feel your pain! It keeps doing the same thing to me!!!! It said I was violating content with sexual content about minors when there are no minors being mentioned and the two characters having sex are both overage!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k0etloi/">(bre2123, Reddit, 2023-09-13)</a></li>
<li>"For the last several days I've received various apologies from the AI... Some of them say that there are consent issues when there are none." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kfgy73g/">(Welsh_Bard, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<h3>Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"If they offered their top plan as an unlimited plan I would use that, but the word limits are absurd for the cost." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k4bw70r/">(Kalta452, Reddit, 2023-10-10)</a></li>

<li>"Good news, I found the censor function can be turned off. Sudowrite just doesn't make it obvious how to do it. You have to go into SETTINGS and switch the AI to UNFILTERED." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/keczoej/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-21)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite interface is excellent and my only gripe with it is the limited text boxes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldfuq2o/">(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-07-16)</a></li>
