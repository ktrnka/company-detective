        <h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Pricing</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I stopped using it because it's prohibitively expensive, and also because they don't value your privacy in the slightest." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kd5q57h/">(paranoidletter17, Reddit, 2023-12-13)</a></li>

<li>"Sudo's new pricing looks exactly like NovelCrafter's platform where you pick your AI platforms when you generate words - just like NovelCrafter. But Sudo charges twice as much for it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/18h1rpe/thoughts_on_sudowrites_new_pricing_plans/kff8fp7/">(Minimum_Spell_2553, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite is IMO a superior product in many ways, but as you said...The pricing is completely insane. A straight rip off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgnijn0/">(whywhatwhenwhoops, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>

<li>"Something major changed on the platform a short while ago... Most prompts just stall and don't do anything. Others are fragmented lines that don't even make sense or change the context completely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdtteq0/">(Qomplete, Reddit, 2023-03-27)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Customer Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load. After trying and waiting for a few hours, I requested help. Got an email asking me if I still wanted help. I replied and the only other email I get is one asking if I received the email. My subsequent email replies have gone unanswered.

It’s great for beginners, but getting good results takes some tinkering in the beginning." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1borsgg/im_trying_out_sudowrite_tips/kwtpboi/">(inkrosw115, Reddit, 2024-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"Just started using Sudowrite and find it extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Positive Feedback on Product Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, I can't confirm any of this.
