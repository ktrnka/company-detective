<p><strong>Sudowrite</strong> is an AI-powered writing tool designed specifically for fiction writers.

</ul>

<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback</h2>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"SW is insanely expensive... I can't justify spending $29 a month for AI when I can get just as much done through OR and not even spend $10 a month." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/lohnjw7/">(coolpop78, Reddit, 2024-09-23)</a></li>

<li>"Sudowrite is too expensive. It's like 20 bucks a month for only 30,000 words. Should be flat fee for unlimited words." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/js2bcil/">(LordShozin6, Reddit, 2023-07-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Performance Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The generate chapter AI however was bad... the amount of the same characters reentering rooms they were already in, completing the same action again but with a different side action, or other junk writing was EVERYWHERE!!!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1dvnmix/my_experience_with_sudowrite/">(Direct-Secretary-279, Reddit, 2024-07-05)</a></li>
<li>"I didn't think the pricing was terrible. My issue was the ai really didn't do a good job of using the input that I added to craft the story." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kqe5m9u/">(Resident-Mine-4987, Reddit, 2024-02-14)</a></li>
<li>"I spent around 3 hours creating all of my backstory, character definitions, example writing, etc. I was very specific about the perspective...

<li>"It used to be better, but now it's totally oblivious to instructions and the content/style of the prompt." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/193gi4w/struggling_with_sudowrite/kh9yq9p/">(One_West503, Reddit, 2024-01-10)</a></li>

<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load. After trying and waiting for a few hours, I requested help. Got an email asking me if I still wanted help. My subsequent email replies have gone unanswered. I am feeling very frustrated and rebuffed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/">(Thewrightrae_5591, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback</h2>
<h3>Usability and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have to say, some of its models are very powerful (and very good), but I feel like there are a lot of ways to use it and a lot of ways to screw it up." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1akj00y/novelai_vs_sudowrite_vs_novelcrafter/kp8y37n/">(PartyMuffinButton, Reddit, 2024-02-06)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Censorship and Content Generation</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite now actively refuses to generate depending on what you write and even threatens account removal. Avoid this service if you value a censorship free service." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/">(AstorSigma, Reddit, 2023-03-08)</a></li>
<li>"I just tried to write a murder scene for my sci-fi/horror novel and Sudowrite responded with: I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable continuing a story containing graphic depictions of violence." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kdymc1u/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-18)</a></li>
<li>"Good news, I found the censor function can be turned off. Sudowrite just doesn't make it obvious how to do it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/keczoej/">(Ishii_Grey, Reddit, 2023-12-21)</a></li>
