        <h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback</h2>
<h3>Censorship and Content Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sudowrite now actively refuses to generate depending on what you write and even threatens account removal. Avoid this service if you value a censorship free service." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/">(AstorSigma, Reddit, 2023-03-08)</a></li>
<li>"I feel your pain! It keeps doing the same thing to me!!!! It said I was violating content with sexual content about minors when there are no minors being mentioned." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k0etloi/">(bre2123, Reddit, 2023-09-13)</a></li>
<li>"For the last several days I've received various apologies from the AI... Some of them say that there are consent issues when there are none." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/kfgy73g/">(Welsh_Bard, Reddit, 2023-12-29)</a></li>
<li>"I just bought a year sub a few months ago and now it's neutered.

</ul>
<h3>Technical Issues and Customer Support</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I subscribed to Sudowrite last week. The editor failed to ever load. After trying and waiting for a few hours, I requested help. Got an email asking me if I still wanted help. My subsequent email replies have gone unanswered. I am feeling very frustrated and rebuffed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/k20s62o/">(Thewrightrae_5591, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Something major changed on the platform a short while ago... Most prompts just stall and don't do anything. Others are fragmented lines that don't even make sense or change the context completely." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jdtteq0/">(Qomplete, Reddit, 2023-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I have a serious issue I need to discuss, but when I click on the 'contact us' link it only takes me to a Google search page and not an actual contact site." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/kf4reiy/">(Available-Credit4055, Reddit, 2023-12-27)</a></li>

<ul>

<li>"Sudowrite is too expensive. It's like 20 bucks a month for only 30,000 words. Should be flat fee for unlimited words." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/js2bcil/">(LordShozin6, Reddit, 2023-07-15)</a></li>
<li>"I agree that their allowed number of words is somewhat low and it turns out too expensive for any serious writing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/iitwg7n/">(Kellin01, Reddit, 2022-08-03)</a></li>
<li>"The high quality write use claude 2 and it's ridiculously expensive credit wise on sudowrite." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1f8y3hk/chatgpt_vs_sudowrite/lln6an8/">(ecchirhino99, Reddit, 2024-09-05)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Positive Feedback</h2>
<h3>Product Quality and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, I can't confirm any of this. Sudowrite is still far superior to any alternative for story writing and it never balks, even at the most graphic scenes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/comments/11lthuu/sudowrite_now_actively_refuses_to_generate/jh4ls40/">(Odd-Cat-5650, Reddit, 2023-04-21)</a></li>
<li>"I have been VERY impressed. It uses GPT3 as its backend but I have found the stuff I get from it is better than my attempts in the playground." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/">(ednever, Reddit, 2022-05-05)</a></li>
<li>"Sudowrite is extremely useful so far. It's more geared towards specific co-writing use-cases rather than generating a whole story on its own, but I really LOVE the ability to give it an outline and letting it expand that into prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/uj4zg7/sudowrite/i7wo0gc/">(monsterfurby, Reddit, 2022-05-09)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>

<li>"From a UI perspective (plug and play) SW is better for beginners." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e47dyi/what_work_similar_to_sudowrite/ldef2r9/">(killerdinodeeno, Reddit, 2024-07-16)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Creative Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>"In Sudowrite, when I used their AI, it follows through with her character with thorough descriptions like 'she suspects it to be the murder weapon supported by the fact that it's found in the crime scene'." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1ekf637/is_there_a_way_to_make_novelai_similar_to/lgo75jn/">(PortaSponge, Reddit, 2024-08-05)</a></li>
<li>"The ability to create novel-esque material. Sudowrite seems to be the only AI tool that can create content that could easily pass for an actual novel." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3codl8/">(WGW30, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"I love Sudo. It is amazing for helping get my ideas and characters into a tight outline." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/16z5xzs/sudowrite_is_by_far_the_best_ai_writing_tool_but/k3cufnw/">(GlitteringKisses, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Learning Curve and Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"With Sudowrite as far as I can tell I can just tick off elements I want it to improve on -- more description etc... is there a way to give it more specific details about what I want it to rewrite the way I do with CHATGPT?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1e5ol00/sudowrite_how_to_give_it_rewrite_instructions/">(BigOldComedyFan, Reddit, 2024-07-17)</a></li>
