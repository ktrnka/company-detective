      <p>I used to like this app. Now started to show incorrect caller ID info. It displays information of people from my contact list. If that doesn't get resolved, I will probably delete the app. UPDATE...just made a call. Name of caller correct. Picture displayed was of someone else in contact list. Address of caller was of a totally different person in mycontact list. This app is messed up bad!!! Update. Problem still there. This app really sucks. UPDATE. Still a problem. Seems like no effort to fix!</p>

I help care for my family numbers saved in my contacts like the school and nursing home should come through correctly. Since im not a premium member, I should have no call blocking period. It certainly doesn't stop the scam calls, so why is it stopping the legitimate ones?</p>

      <p>Updating this to say it's still working. Despite what sounds have written it does block but you have to configure it. Great at blocking all unwanted calls. Don't let your life be miserable due to debt collectors and unwanted calls! ☎️ Does not have multi SIM capability ☎️</p>

      <p>Not aure why I'm still getting numerous calls coming through, even though I've paid for premium AND using the feature where you can 'block numbers that begin with' and I input a whole LOAD of numbers beginning with 07...!!! So what's the point? It did block quite a few numbers before but I'm struggling to comprehend why it's so hard for the app to simply block ALL 07 numbers. So a bit frustrated really. On one day it blocked 5 out of 7 calls, so it does work... just not as good as it could.</p>

      <p>We have enough to pay for, I am not going to pay for an ineffective spam blocker. The free version is completely useless. The problem today is not flagged spam calls that can be blocked by free programs already in your phone, the problem today, is unflagged nuisance calls that are not blocked by these apps. You have to do better and effective ad free versions must be available</p>

      <p>It doesn't block spam, it just tells you Suspected Spam on screen. I can figure that out myself. The other thing it doesn't do is show your Contacts anywhere, even though it insists on access to them. What kind of phone dialer can't show Contacts? How are you supposed to make a call, unless you memorize every single contact you have??</p>

I received still has some hiccups. That I'm experiencing and a few features that I wish it had, maybe it does. Still learning about all the features. Has more features than I know about.

      <p>1. If you navigate away from the dialer to look up something, you can't get back to it. Even going to the app has no effect you cant end a call! 2. Many numbers still come up as unknown despite being unknown numbers hidden being turned on in settings. 3. Still slow to show up when phone is ringing. Often gobe to voice mail before i coukd answer. 4. No way to import current block list. Can't believe this isn't done automatically!!! Or even a manual import option! 5. No way to hide scam/tele calls</p>

      <p>I finally realized this app is showing what I need as Spam they are not I need a lot of the apps they show as Spam and now I get so many spam calls I have to shut off my phone I think over 30 to 40 spams and those they don't block or show up not spam is really 🤪 out of hand. I used to like this app for many years but now they have a long way to go so 🤷 I really think at this time I'm canceling until these issues are resolved it was a 5 now no rating 😅.</p>

      <p>I appreciate the ability to block entire prefixes. That’s the main feature needed to block angry spammers & scammers. Unfortunately I p!ssed off a scammer after I cussed him & told him to stop calling. Right after I received a threatening text from the guy LoL! telling me how he was going to keep calling. Then a barrage of spam calls started coming in. iPhone settings weren’t enough to completely silence the attack so I tried out a few spam apps, most have a bunch of unnecessary useless goofy features, cost over $120 a year, and don’t work (the robo one) but this app actually works, is simple to use & costs $24 a year. Their prefix blocker is the best feature it allows just three digits rather than a 5 digit minimum like other apps.This feature is in addition to their standard phone number blocker</p>

      <h4>Completely Useless App, 1 stars (TheOptiMystic1, Apple App Store, 2024-04-18)</h4>
      <p>It’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.

I previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.

Despite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.

Secondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.

So, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?

As I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.

I know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!</p>

You can’t just unregister your number, you have to replace it with another number, deleting the app doesn’t stop it either. I had to make a google voice number to register it under to get my phone number back. Their customer service was non existent, the customer support is an email which you get an automated response saying they won’t reply.

      <p>Spam callers are such a nuisance. They are also clever and seem to outwit spam blocking software with ease. I've tried several, and Hiya seems to be on a par with all of them. Spam increases with elections and other seasonal activity, and some get through. When that happens I block them both on my phone and in Hiya. I believe phone companies could do more to stop spammers, but they make money from calls so they have little incentive to do so. The FCC should impose regulations to incentivize them to do more.</p>

      <p>This app used to be free and worked pretty good. You had to enter area codes you use that may be spoofed. The app would update with numbers found to be questionable when the app wasn’t force closed. I don’t know if the app scanned for these, or if they were shared by other users. It reminds me a little of Waze though. For years, I recommended that people try it. No more. 

Now it does nothing except allow me to report questionable calls, and I just reported my last number to them. $25/year is just too high for this kind of automatic service. But then, there’s a lot of people who think they’re worth more than they are too.</p>

I really like the “neighborhood “ screening when the app looks at your area code and blocks the area codes that associated with that area. I use my old number in a state that has a different Area Code and the app blocks all the junk calls in my old area. Junk calls use fictional numbers to make the calls and the app keeps track of the locations. Really good app and it’s less expensive than the Verizon app and is a lot smarter.</p>
