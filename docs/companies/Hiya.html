      <p>I'm rather disappointed. There's no dark mode and it is seriously lacking features. I also don't see much point in paying when I don't get many spam calls. I also don't see the point in having the options shown after each call is ended if the screen disappears automatically. It literally gives me just 2 seconds to decide before closing. If you included contact photo and info sync (collected from social media), I'd sign up up for life!</p>

      <p>This app sucks. I hate all the intrusive forced call overlays - that aren't even responsive!! So you are stuck on screens when you're trying to answer a call or even when you're trying to make one. If you're going to force an interface on folks, at least make it not glitchy and filled with delays. Garbage.</p>

      <p>Lowered my rating and uninstalling. Premium was already too expensive, but now that the service is worse, it's totally not worth paying for. Calls in my contacts get blocked. Spammers come through and Hiya somehow lists them with names from my contact list and with my contact's cities even though the phone numbers listed are not from those cities. 5+ years paying them and no change to amount of spam or to putting spammers out of business. They could be the best but keep getting worse instead.</p>

If that doesn't get resolved, I will probably delete the app. UPDATE...just made a call. Name of caller correct. Picture displayed was of someone else in contact list. Address of caller was of a totally different person in mycontact list. This app is messed up bad!!! Update. Problem still there. This app really sucks. UPDATE. Still a problem.

      <p>Not aure why I'm still getting numerous calls coming through, even though I've paid for premium AND using the feature where you can 'block numbers that begin with' and I input a whole LOAD of numbers beginning with 07...!!! So what's the point? It did block quite a few numbers before but I'm struggling to comprehend why it's so hard for the app to simply block ALL 07 numbers. So a bit frustrated really. On one day it blocked 5 out of 7 calls, so it does work... just not as good as it could.</p>

      <p>We have enough to pay for, I am not going to pay for an ineffective spam blocker. The free version is completely useless. The problem today is not flagged spam calls that can be blocked by free programs already in your phone, the problem today, is unflagged nuisance calls that are not blocked by these apps. You have to do better and effective ad free versions must be available</p>

      <p>It doesn't block spam, it just tells you Suspected Spam on screen. I can figure that out myself. The other thing it doesn't do is show your Contacts anywhere, even though it insists on access to them. What kind of phone dialer can't show Contacts? How are you supposed to make a call, unless you memorize every single contact you have??</p>

      <p>This App has been so useful, I've been plagued with call, from unsafe numbers, trying to hide their identity. I would consider an Add free function. Thank you.</p>

      <p>I'm giving your app another try. After I installed it, I was verifying my phone number as it requires, but then before completing, an error message pops up saying "Sorry but the system unavailable now, try again later"! Now what's up with that? Cmon developers, I really like the app but FIX IT!</p>
