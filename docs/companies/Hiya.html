      <p>+good job identifying the spam calls and identiting the business caller ID (back had some good features for free) Update: all the good necessary features are behind the paywall. The free version is useless/garbage. I uninstalled. Also, I found a few apps together you can install together in the Google play store that does all of what hiya does for free. To be fair I won't say it but do your research. It was tough to find them but I found them. With those apps: you find the caller id name</p>

      <p>I despised the pop-up feature by Truecaller. The Truecaller in iOS doesn't pop up when trying to show details of callers. It only appears in smaller font sizes under the number. It shows the caller id in the call list under ones number. I hate the constant popups on my screen, and here you are, adopting similar features</p>

      <p>It says it needs to verify your number before you can use it.. justifying freely offering your number by consent. But if left alone the phone rings through and dials out without giving them one stick of information. They just want your consent to own your data to sell it</p>

      <p>Doesn't do much good. Making calls is less convenient. If a legit number gets flagged by enough people, like my union outreach, there's nothing you can do to fix it. Likewise with any number that's been assigned the wrong ID, unless you want to add it to your contacts (and sometimes even then you can't fix it). After a few months of use, all new caller info gets hidden behind premium. Also, phone number links from the web or elsewhere get lost when tapped to call. Have to go back and copy again.</p>

      <p>I'm rather disappointed. There's no dark mode and it is seriously lacking features. I also don't see much point in paying when I don't get many spam calls. I also don't see the point in having the options shown after each call is ended if the screen disappears automatically. It literally gives me just 2 seconds to decide before closing. If you included contact photo and info sync (collected from social media), I'd sign up up for life!</p>

      <p>This app sucks. I hate all the intrusive forced call overlays - that aren't even responsive!! So you are stuck on screens when you're trying to answer a call or even when you're trying to make one. If you're going to force an interface on folks, at least make it not glitchy and filled with delays. Garbage.</p>

      <p>Lowered my rating and uninstalling. Premium was already too expensive, but now that the service is worse, it's totally not worth paying for. Calls in my contacts get blocked. Spammers come through and Hiya somehow lists them with names from my contact list and with my contact's cities even though the phone numbers listed are not from those cities. 5+ years paying them and no change to amount of spam or to putting spammers out of business. They could be the best but keep getting worse instead.</p>

So what's the point? It did block quite a few numbers before but I'm struggling to comprehend why it's so hard for the app to simply block ALL 07 numbers. So a bit frustrated really. On one day it blocked 5 out of 7 calls, so it does work... just not as good as it could.</p>

Negative ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I had this app years ago. I hated it! Getting untangled from the plan was a nightmare! I still hate this app! Batched voicemails that won’t play and repeat often is awful. Each of the last, generally three, calls keep sending day after day. They have exactly the same received date. As a result, I have no idea when the call/vm was received. For voicemail messages I have to use Transcript to get Hiya’s interpretation of voicemails. 

Last week, I submitted a request for help with numerous app issues and received a fill-in-the-blank reply that there is no guarantee that they will respond personally. What??? There is NO telephone support. So…too bad customers in need of support. I canceled my subscription because this app bites. I want a subscription refund and my contacts back. 

I will not try Hiya again! 😡😡😡 Warning to the wise: Beware!</p>

      <p>Pros- Does a good job of protecting and providing info on known phone numbers that are identified as spam by other users. Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them. But do Report them through this Hiya app for now and hope that spam call scientists find a way to neutralize this curse to our existence before we end up eating ourselves out of the trap to break free into a new more nub-centric experience.</p>

      <h4>Basic Caller ID, 1 stars (Matt Grutza, Apple App Store, 2024-10-02)</h4>
      <p>The free version of this app is just caller ID which works sometimes.

All of the good features like preventing voicemail from callers is locked behind a subscription.

Just block the number on your phone if you want it's the same as the free version.</p>

      <h4>Charged me $21.59 the second I signed up for “free trial”, 3 stars (Temis370, Apple App Store, 2025-02-02)</h4>
      <p>I signed up for the free trial to try this app out the second hit the free trial button which mentions charging you $3.99 a month after the free trial end it charged me $21.59…

I think I sent an email using their help section. However, whenever I wrote out the email and hit send it seems like that portion of the wrap purposely works slow and doesn’t give a confirmation the number was sent. 
I will give them 48 hours, but then I will stop payment.

Seems like a scam but hopefully they respond.</p>

      <p>I used Hiya years ago but can’t remember why I stopped. Tried again some years later but there was a terrible lag after the call rolled over to the Hiya voicemail and notification. All of that seems to be resolved now. It works well at identifying callers. It uses call forwarding like many call blocking apps now but is no frills. Hiya is a good alternative to silencing calls of numbers not in your contacts. I have found it useful but I can’t speak to the actual spam blocking capabilities.</p>

      <p>Terrible app! People leave voicemails within the app cannot play them back or have them transcribed. App just sits there and never starts playback. Tried to uninstall and reinstall the app to find out that the entire blocklist that I’ve built up over the past six months as well as all saved voicemails and call logs have disappeared and are not synced to iCloud. Further the call log has specific phone calls that are stuck forever that cannot be deleted that always come back. The app has some serious bugs. Not only have I lost money on this 1YR subscription, I’ve lost voicemails that I never heard that are important for my business and a block list that I’ve painstakingly built up over the past many months.</p>

If you have ever filled out an application online for monster jobs, Indeed, etc. you know how annoying this can be. It’s your phone, your time, and your money so where does this give these arrogant, narcissistic, dishonest and disrespectful telemarketers and these thieving people spoofing, and spamming, etc. I really recommend getting this and the app also has a Caller ID that is definitely worth paying for if you want to stop all the wasted time dealing with these persistent distractions!</p>
