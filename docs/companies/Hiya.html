      <p>I was told by cricket wireless cell phone service that you are affiliated with the service but, I don't understand why you allow phone calls to get through my phone service and when I call back they're not in service. They should be blocked by the app not by me. And yet you want to be paid for a service that you can't provide!! You should be able to look into the data base and know for sure if a number is in service before I get a call.</p>

      <p>The app kinda works,I guess. But it's so sloppy and unreliable. Most numbers just say "unknown caller", for example. It spams useless notifications, like letting you know that you just ended a call. And there's this dangerous feature where it offers to text spammers back to ask if they're really a spammer. Probably just going to knock off my subscription after this year. It's really not worth it anymore.</p>

      <p>Not fit for purpose - Always sends private numbers to voicemail and they do not even show in call log. Private numbers are set to warn but they are blocked without any log. I have missed important calls from hospital etc, only way to recieve a call from a private numbers was to uninstall. Recently upgraded to a new samsung phone and exactly the same problem. Uninstalled and cancelling premium. I doubt Hiya will respond to this looking at all the other reviews they have ignored</p>

      <p>Awesome app!!! With scams,frauds and identity theft on the rise it's reassuring knowing your carrier has an app that prevents your phone from even ringing.... tempting you to answer it. Not to mention the 2 & 3 am calls finally stopping! The paid version even gives you the name associated with the number. It's great!</p>

I was getting so many spam calls and voicemails it was driving me crazy. I thought I had finally stopped them with this app. And then the spam voicemails started again.

      <p>So far, it's OK. The HIYA app does not allow my phone to capture the call history. It does not save to my regular voice mail. Is this intentional? This does not make me feel confident that the app is as useful as I thought. Hopefully, my experience improves.</p>

      <p>Spam callers are such a nuisance. They are also clever and seem to outwit spam blocking software with ease. I've tried several, and Hiya seems to be on a par with all of them. Spam increases with elections and other seasonal activity, and some get through. When that happens I block them both on my phone and in Hiya. I believe phone companies could do more to stop spammers, but they make money from calls so they have little incentive to do so. The FCC should impose regulations to incentivize them to do more.</p>

      <p>I used to be able to search and get a name of a person that’s associated with the phone number that called me. For a long time now, though, all it says is “personal line.” It never gives me a name anymore.  I was only paying for the subscription for this feature, which is now useless. I just wish I had come to this conclusion BEFORE my automatic renewal. Now I’ve paid for another useless year through next August.</p>

      <p>PSA: don’t download the HIYA App to block numbers. it took over my phone number, it took over my voicemail completely, the greeting was different and I didn’t get any voicemails,  every incoming call (in my contacts or not) came with another outgoing call on my usage from hiya. You can’t just unregister your number, you have to replace it with another number, deleting the app doesn’t stop it either. I had to make a google voice number to register it under to get my phone number back. Their customer service was non existent, the customer support is an email which you get an automated response saying they won’t reply. 

Don’t use HIYA.</p>

      <h4>Fails to deliver on its promise, 1 stars (Iarneson, Apple App Store, 2024-08-09)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded this app with high hopes that it would finally put an end to the constant stream of spam and scam calls I receive daily. Unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its claims, the app barely blocks any unwanted calls. In fact, I’ve noticed no significant reduction in the number of spam calls I’m receiving. The app’s interface is clunky and not user-friendly. It’s difficult to navigate and offers very few customization options to better tailor the blocking features to my needs. Worse yet, legitimate calls are occasionally blocked while spam calls still get through. This defeats the entire purpose of the app! I’ve tried adjusting the settings multiple times, but nothing seems to improve its performance. It’s incredibly frustrating to be expected to pay for a service that doesn’t work as advertised. Save your money and look elsewhere if you’re serious about blocking spam and scam calls.</p>

      <p>So, have used this app for years, purchase the premium upgrade every year, recently the app doesn’t show calls for 12+ hours, lists them with inaccurate days/times in the log, rarely transcribes the messages, and overall has been buggy. These things happen. That’s not why the 1 star, the reason for the poor review is that there is no contact for them through the app, they don’t list a phone number, just a link to their twitter/X (which you have to upgrade to premium and get verified on before they let you message them), and a link to rate…so here’s to hoping someone from their. Customer service dept reaches out to help…</p>

      <p>It’s not just Hiya. Spam call blockers just don’t work well on iPhone. For most to work properly now, the calls have to go to their service first, compared against a database and stir/shaken protocol and then sent to your phone. For those complaining about their voicemail being broken, it’s because your phone is forwarding out to this service. Search disable call forwarding codes for your mobile carrier to get your VM back. Spam really needs to be blocked at the switch level with your carrier and is the whole point of stir/shaken.  Check to see if your carrier has a spam tool for your phone and use that. I use Hiya mainly for lookups of numbers and to block calls which it does ok.</p>

      <p>Pros- Does a good job of protecting and providing info on known phone numbers that are identified as spam by other users. Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them. But do Report them through this Hiya app for now and hope that spam call scientists find a way to neutralize this curse to our existence before we end up eating ourselves out of the trap to break free into a new more nub-centric experience.</p>

      <p>I really had high expectations for this app and was excited for it since it says you can block entire prefix area codes (which does not work) by the way. I still get repeated calls from the area codes I blocked and even the repeated calls the app doesn’t auto block even though I have it set to auto block! Super annoying. Plus they make you change settings on the iPhone like the incoming call screen which I don’t get. I don’t want the incoming call screen to take up the entire screen especially if I’m using maps or using music. It’s annoying. Lastly, I contacted support about the issues I’m having with this and it says “we MAY NOT respond to your inquiry in some cases” what the heck kind of customer service is that? I am disappointed to say the least. And hoping they can get the bugs fixed.</p>

      <p>Everything works pretty much as it should here, but there needs to be some simple way of copying or jotting down phone numbers, so they can be pasted without parentheses and so forth at the Do Not Call site, which requires a 10 digit format and makes pasting a longer string impossible. This obviously isn't Hiya's fault, but I will add that when switching out of the app and back, it often displays my contacts on the block page, which was alarming before I realized it was a bug. This gave the impression that the app had mistakenly blocked calls from family.</p>

Today, they screened a call I’d been waiting for from a doctor whose name is in my contacts, so I missed an important medical call. My phone was in my pocket and it never rang! They’re pretty good at screening the auto policy people, but they need to work on allowing contacts through without tossing them into voicemail.</p>

      <p>App seems to catch spam and block but the “knowing who is calling” is overstated.  I tested numbers I have screened through Verizon Call Filter and it at least identified the VOIP service supporting the scammers and solicitors.  These are firms supplying the local phone numbers scammers and solicitors use to try to get you to pickup.   This is important because soon such firms will be held accountable for supporting such communications under FCC regulations.  If Hiya had a more robust research feature it would be a contender.  I’m sorry I paid for a full years premium subscription based on its marketing and marketing driven news articles.  Now let’s see if they will honor a cancellation.</p>

      <h4>Completely Useless App, 1 stars (TheOptiMystic1, Apple App Store, 2024-04-18)</h4>
      <p>It’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.

I previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.

Despite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.

Secondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.

So, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?

As I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.

I know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!</p>

      <h4>Keeps dropping out of settings, 1 stars (equals 42, Apple App Store, 2024-04-16)</h4>
      <p>Update (2024): It wants to screen all calls to be useful. I cannot allow them to intercept my business calls.  Useless. I also need to be able to block whole blocks of phone numbers. One company with +1(XXX)XXX-712# as their block of phone numbers should be easy to block in one swoop. I’m not asking for regex but maybe anything matching but the last two numbers would be useful. Heck, I would like to block whole area codes. 
Update (2023): Still drops off in iOS 17 I can’t keep this in working order. The beta for iOS 14 is over and they still can’t get it together so the app appears in “phone” settings to choose as the call blocker. It also doesn’t show anything it actually blocked. Still getting telemarketing calls.</p>

      <p>The app has the ability to hijack your phone. It answers your calls before you get a chance to answer them and might pass it to you., otherwise it goes to a black hole. All your calls are automatically forwarded to their system. I want to opt out of everything except spam block. This app has gotten so robust that it’s all or nothing. It takes over your phone. I’ve sent at least 15 emails to support trying to find out how to get the app to stop answering my calls and storing my voicemails which I can’t stop it from recording. All I get are irritated responses to disable everything. Well, every time I open the app, it re-enables EVERYTHING!!! I’m tired of fighting with this app and the no help support. When my subscription expires…I’m gone. I DO NOT recommend this app.</p>

That said, for now I'm sticking with the latter, as I need the ability to block all calls except for ones in my contacts. Or, there was a briefly lived app that required an access code to put calls through. That was super, as I am a professional who gets a lot of business calls on my cellphone--even though I guard the number zealously. So being able to limit calls to my family and my answering service would be ideal.</p>

      <p>This app used to be free and worked pretty good. You had to enter area codes you use that may be spoofed. The app would update with numbers found to be questionable when the app wasn’t force closed. I don’t know if the app scanned for these, or if they were shared by other users. It reminds me a little of Waze though. For years, I recommended that people try it. No more. 

Now it does nothing except allow me to report questionable calls, and I just reported my last number to them. $25/year is just too high for this kind of automatic service. But then, there’s a lot of people who think they’re worth more than they are too.</p>

      <p>Don’t waste money on the ‘premium’ service, unless you are going to set the app up to screen your calls.  I can’t do that since I use the number for business - I’m not going to put a prospective client through that.  Short of using the call screening service, the app is useless.  In the 5 days I’ve had the premium service active it has blocked 4 calls.  I still receive between 20-30 spam calls a day.  Even numbers that come through as ‘likely spam’ are not blocked.  Sorry, it’s just pretty useless when it comes to foreign spam that is routed through internet and spoof numbers.</p>

Spam..etc. I gives me the opportunity to see if I do know the number without app deleting it. If I decide, it can be permanently blocked.

      <p>I give this a poor rating because I am missing business calls from people I need to talk to.  It seems if the number is not in the contacts then I do not receive the call.  Very very bad.  Not all unlisted numbers are spoofed or spammed  and Hiya should not block these calls nor should I have to answer these calls through Hiya.  If this problem does not resolve I will not be renewing.</p>

      <p>Love this app! I never answer calls from numbers I don’t know. Then I check the number on Hiya. It tells me either the name of the person calling or that the call was suspected spam which I can then block. Whenever I get a spam voicemail I report it on Hiya so other people using the app can know it’s spam. The key is for everyone using the app to report spam numbers so hopefully everybody using it is doing that to help everyone else out!</p>

      <p>The blocking is so good, you never see the numbers except momentarily on your screen. I really like the “neighborhood “ screening when the app looks at your area code and blocks the area codes that associated with that area. I use my old number in a state that has a different Area Code and the app blocks all the junk calls in my old area. Junk calls use fictional numbers to make the calls and the app keeps track of the locations. Really good app and it’s less expensive than the Verizon app and is a lot smarter.</p>

      <p>The app blocks spam calls. Maybe others but I haven’t discovered if it has got it wrong. The two flaws… my voicemail is set up correctly. Notifications told me today I got a voicemail but it was not there. Then hours later SMS told me I had the same voicemail. So I went thinking it just took a while… no voicemail. Second flaw, only FAQ support. There is no option to communicate with a human to get support. I’ve got the premium that is paid until Dec 2024 and now I can’t trust that the app is doing what it should.</p>

      <p>To those reviewers complaining that the app does not block spam calls and scam calls, just go to the settings within the app and configure the app to block the respective calls. That said, one area for improvement would be if the app were to provide a log of the blocked calls. This would afford the user to see that the app is definitely doing its job and would also allow the user to check whether some desired calls were accidentally blocked by the app. Last, but not least, it would be great if a Hiya add-on were to be made available for Skype as well.</p>

      <h4>Functionality deterioration over the years, 2 stars (amathews, Apple App Store, 2024-01-11)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been a paid subscriber since 2018, at least. When I first got the service, basically every call would have an ID, spam alert, or SOME notification from HIYA verifying / advising. 

I have had 71 spam calls in the last two weeks. Hiya recognized no spam calls as spam. The 2 numbers it did identify were the chase fraud department, which was nice, but they leave voicemails. 

As this app doesn’t block calls at all for me anymore, nor has it for almost a year. I simply block all unknown callers at this point. Making this app basically worthless for me at this point. 

I have tried to fix this, reset the phone, reinstall the app… the intermittent functionality is continual.</p>

      <h4>Horrible support/customer service, 1 stars (iluvtofumt, Apple App Store, 2024-01-09)</h4>
      <p>Apparently there is no way to prevent a number Hiya has decided should be blocked from being blocked for yourself, aka whitelist. I’ve asked support three times and each time I only get a canned response saying they unblocked the single number I was referencing. Here’s the problem. The number is for Uber. Uber uses a number exchange so when drivers and riders communicate their personal numbers aren’t shared. When Hiya blocks one of these numbers, drivers and customers can’t communicate. So the one number they unblocked is fine but there are many many more numbers they use for the exchange so having to contact support with each number they block is very inefficient and I have better things to do. And also, it’s too late, the call was already blocked. In the third email with Hiya support I said that if there isn’t a way for me to whitelist numbers I would have to request a refund. They didn’t care, just send me instructions on how to get a refund.</p>

Hiya - Not so excellent anymore—- As of November 2023 I like the Hiya App less. It was then they started or near then that call screener came on the scene, and at that time it was personal contacts, people and family I know would call and when I’d pick up on the call it would disconnect and send them to VM. That’s very disturbing. The screening aspect is fine and good but not when it cause’s disconnect from people you know and don’t like causing an convenience of being hung up on. If this is the way Hiya service will continue I don’t see myself continuing another year at the end of my current subscription.</p>

      <h4>Newest update & redesign, 2 stars (Lucky13624, Apple App Store, 2023-11-28)</h4>
      <p>I pay for yearly premium service as I get a lot of random calls that are spam. This newest upgrade to the app and redesign is a step backwards. It’s take away the option to actually look up phone numbers, and now only seems to give the option to view “screened” or blocked calls, which are now located in 2 different places instead of being able to see them in one more centralized location on the app. You’re provided with no information to confirm if when the last time things were updated or if that update is in process and how many numbers you may now be protected against. Giving only 2 stars at this time because of features being removed that are part of the subscription. Please bring back the old version with all of the features that subscribers are supposed to be getting by paying for this service!!!

Update: this app seems to get worse with at least every other update. The “call screener” that’s supposed to actually screen calls by having the person calling say something so you can decide if you want to answer or not, hasn’t worked in months and is letting almost as many if not more spam calls through as it’s blocking.</p>

      <p>This never tells you it’s spam and blocks it.  It still rings though even when suspected spam.  So then you report it as a robocall and it adds to their database of robocalls. 

It’s like a Ponzi scheme.  Telling you it’s spam after the fact is like letting a burglar take you stuff as you watch, then setting off the alarm afterwards. 

The only value is the lookup tool, but it’s so hard to get numbers blocked it’s a waste because these robocalls make up new numbers all the time.  Stupid really, and I fell for it. 

Have to leave app running all the time for it to supposedly showing you about blocked calls.  It’s always different numbers and so I’m leaving the app open for no good reason 

Save your money, this in itself is a scam that doesn’t really help lessen spam calls.</p>

Those days are gone one we were only looking in the city where we live now it’s all over the World. Technology is changing every day every second and yes every minute! Are you going to get every time you’re phone rings information as who is calling? ( good luck on that thought) why because the people who created the words Spam and Fraud are changing their numbers every day every second and yes every minute. The Developers of this app are working hard to make this app the best they can to meet the technology changes that are taking place as I write this and I hope you read. How do I know the Developers are working hard look at the number of updates that are being made! So download this app today now will you be sorry? I don’t think so will you get who is calling information all the time ( good luck ) , these great Developers are working hard to some day soon do that for you and myself. Too the Developers thanks for a 5 star app with a great unique design! I Tip my Hat 🎩 for all of the Hard Work you’ve done over all the years to create a Unique Outstanding Design App! “ Thank’s “</p>

      <p>This was once the app I would recommend to anyone needing effective call blocking. At this point though they are the top of my list to avoid. Essential call blocking features for which users pay, such as blocking numbers that start with a particular string, can no longer be activated unless you also use their extremely invasive third-party call screener function. No, there is no direct connection between the features. They just want access to your calls.  The call screener nag screen also pops up on a regular basis when trying to block numbers individually. I have no intention of letting anyone be funneled through a third-party redirect. I own an iPhone which offers the security that is needed. I’m not giving it up so that Hiya can screen and manage all of my calls and have direct access to that data in the process. This is unacceptable and I am not sure why Apple has not blocked the current app.</p>

      <h4>Can’t understand Call screener, 1 stars (AlaskanGuy94, Apple App Store, 2023-11-11)</h4>
      <p>When the call screener is enabled, it forwards your calls to identity themselves before they connect you, but it fails to tell the caller that. All it says when someone calls is “this user is protected by hiya” or something like that. In a very computerized voice that most folks don’t understand because it’s too quite. It doesn’t tell them to identity themselves, just says that and beeps like it’s a voicemail. Leading to the person calling to leave a message instead of staying on the line while the app connects themselves. There are far better alternatives then this app. Get Robokiller instead. It’s the only one that I’ve found that has a customizable personal screener.</p>

      <p>After iOS 17, Hiya requests a bunch of different setup steps than it had, some of which appear invasive and potentially difficult to undo. Some of it also appears to conflict with iOS 17 call screening. The setup steps don’t appear to take dual sim iPhones into account either.

If they’re radically changing how the app works, it needs to explain that up front. It also needs to show that it works alongside Apple’s features (if it does). And it’s also long overdue for supporting dual active sims. iPhones have supported dual active sims for years.

Going to the support site, the FAQ has a bunch of tags that basically blame Apple for missing or incomplete features such as neighbor spoofing not blocking contacts. That’s not terribly professional looking either.</p>

      <h4>No More Lookup, 3 stars (Fadel 26, Apple App Store, 2023-09-22)</h4>
      <p>I have been using this app for maybe 5 years or more. This app has always helped me figure out random numbers that text and or call me. Now this feature doesn’t not work anymore and I don’t know why. Every number I look up says “personal line” and does not give any information to help me figure out who text me called me before I respond back. I hope a dev can explain why this is happening or fix it.</p>

      <p>I got this app with the claims that it identifies cell phone callers. It did for awhile. 60-70% of the calls now have no information with it. I am getting inundated with unwanted calls daily even though I paid for the premium plan and continuously update the spam list. I won’t renew this again. There are other apps that must be better than this one.</p>

      <h4>Hiya is the Best!, 5 stars (Badbeaver, Apple App Store, 2023-09-19)</h4>
      <p>I don’t answer calls from unidentified numbers. If someone calls and I don’t answer, they have the opportunity to leave a msg. If they don’t leave a msg I figure they didn’t really wish to speak to me in the first place. I then submit the number to Hiya and Hiya tells me who belongs to almost every number, or, if there’s no one registered to that number. Hiya gives me a link to block that number. I block almost all who don’t bother leaving a msg because all they want is to con me anyway.</p>

      <p>I have cancelled my subscription, uninstalled the app multiple times, followed every piece of advice available online through the app support, YouTube, etc and my voicemails are still being sent to some hiya app voicemail that I never even set up.  I don’t even have the app anymore and every time I miss a call I get a text saying “ You have 30 new voicemails! Open the Hiya app to listen to them. Reply STOP to opt out of any future SMS from us. “ I don’t even have the app or any sort of subscription anymore!! I also have reached out three times now for help in the past year and have yet to hear back at all. There is no phone number, all you can do is email them and apparently nobody cares enough to reply. I never wanted my voicemails redirected and I have no way to access them. Again, I DON’T EVEN HAVE THE APP.  I am beyond frustrated and disappointed with the app as well as customer support.</p>

      <h4>Pretty good but treats contacts as spam, 4 stars (TheNewEnglandah, Apple App Store, 2023-09-06)</h4>
      <p>Overall, I would say this app is pretty decent at preventing 98% of spam calls!
The trouble is with how it handles contacts in my phone directory, if I don’t pick up my phone in time or if for some reason, my network is disconnected like I’m in a bad service area and my phone doesn’t ring at all people I know get directed to my call screener and have no idea why! I would prefer that contacts automatically get routed to my phone and not screened letting my phone treat a missed call like it would any other missed call by sending it to my personal voicemail not the screener.</p>
