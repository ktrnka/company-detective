      <p>Great effort to replace system caller and its call blocking works pretty well. Thank you for that. But lacking other numerous features still devalues this app, unfortunately. It doesn't have a message button during a call. There is no contacts button in the app. Doesn't support call assistant during the call. Doesn't show the number during the call (when it knows the name, it shows only that. Good and bad at the same time). Doesn't separate call logs by days. And I think there is more to it</p>

      <p>First off, I have been a paying subscriber to this app for several years now. However, since getting a new phone, it has stopped working. I have been trying for weeks to get ahold of customer support to no avail. I like the app and want to continue using it, however without offering any sort of support, I cannot recommend it. I'm hoping someone from the company reaches out to rectify the situation.</p>

      <p>It's a great App the only thing I don't like is that when you make or Receive a call there's a white popup screen with the logo on it I can't for the life of me find out how to stop this from continuing help But On every other thing this app offers is Worth it and it does stop scam and nuisance calls it also has a look up the number when it tells you it's spam you hit that and it tells you what it been reported for scam or fraud Brilliant App</p>

      <p>Doesn't display "fraud, spam, nuisance" ect as the call is happening. It only displays caller information after the call has ended so you can't look at your screen and see if it's a scam call as your phone is ringing you have to end the call then look at your call log to see if a scammer was calling. So quite useless I'd say.</p>

      <h4>Totally Useless – Never Works!, 1 stars (mozeich, Apple App Store, 2025-02-26)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded Hiya with high hopes of finally getting relief from spam calls, but this app has been a complete disappointment. I also paid for the premium service. It NEVER works! It doesn’t block calls, it doesn’t identify spam, and half the time, it doesn’t even load properly. I’ve followed every troubleshooting step, checked my settings, and even reinstalled the app multiple times—nothing helps.

I still get bombarded with robocalls daily, and Hiya doesn’t catch a single one. It’s like the app is just there for show. I feel like I wasted my time and money on something that does absolutely nothing.

Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere. This app is a total flop.</p>

      <p>App seems to catch spam and block but the “knowing who is calling” is overstated.  I tested numbers I have screened through Verizon Call Filter and it at least identified the VOIP service supporting the scammers and solicitors.  These are firms supplying the local phone numbers scammers and solicitors use to try to get you to pickup.   This is important because soon such firms will be held accountable for supporting such communications under FCC regulations.  If Hiya had a more robust research feature it would be a contender.  I’m sorry I paid for a full years premium subscription based on its marketing and marketing driven news articles.  Now let’s see if they will honor a cancellation.</p>

      <p>Hiya used to work as advertised. If anything, it blocked calls too well. In the last tree, though, it doesn’t seem to block anything, and since I upgraded to a paid subscription, the volume of spam calls that Hiya is not blocking has gone up dramatically. The Call Screener feature seems to do nothing at all except on the provided test call. 

I’m left wondering if the scammers now control Hiya’s development.</p>

      <h4>Completely Useless App, 1 stars (TheOptiMystic1, Apple App Store, 2024-04-18)</h4>
      <p>It’s hard to fathom how this company stays in business with such a poor app. It must be because it’s used as the default call ID/blocker on Samsung phones. On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.

I previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.

Despite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.

Secondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.

So, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?

As I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago. Doesn’t really instill confidence that there’s any attention given to this app.

I know this review is harsh, but that’s how ineffective and frustrating the app is. Do not waste your money!</p>

      <h4>Excellent in identifying spam calls, 5 stars (nicoladie, Apple App Store, 2024-11-27)</h4>
      <p>It is one of the best call identifying and blocking apps. Their crowdsourcing identifies the spammers and scammers phone numbers much better than other spam blocking apps. Their spammer database is very up to date, apparently more users are reporting the spam calls to them than other platforms. They do not keep displaying annoying advertising page to make you pay for their services before you report the spammer’s phone number like the other apps. They give you free service for identifying, reporting, and blocking spammers. They don’t keep asking or tricking you to subscribe to their premium service.

For some reason, their FAQ on the website said you can block spoofed calls with specific area code and prefix by tapping the Protect tab, but the Protect tab doesn’t exist in the latest version. I don’t know if it’s a Premium subscription feature only b

I only allow them to screen and block callers. For privacy reasons, I don’t allow any app to screen my text messages (or collect any data from messages even though most email apps scan for junk emails, they could collect data on your private communications which is why most public email accounts are free to target their ads to you, text messages are much more private than emails to allow them to collect data from). I don’t know if they could screen your encrypted and-to-end messages when you turn on the text message screening option.</p>
