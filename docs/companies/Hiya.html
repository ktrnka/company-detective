      <p>A complete bloatware in 2025. Does nothing as per what it advertises. Contacted Hiya team and they told me that app is discontinued in providing spam protection since they are partnering with businesses and spam callers for business growth. You might see updates but that is just formality. App, in terms of, functionality is fundamentally broken. It amazes me how Samsung has partnered with Hiya for spam protection for their devices. See Truecaller premium which I had to use unfortunately.</p>

      <p>I should be able to mark a call as spam & be confident it will be blocked on repeated calls, but no. I have to remark it a lot before it remembers that. There should be a setting you can mark types of calls to block, send to VM & alert a type went to VM. It should be able to identify simple types of calls like that. My last scam block had no problem identifying any kind of calls, followed my setting exactly. Also my VM to TX Message is non existent. Never had worked. Was a priority</p>

      <p>I wonder if coders are getting dumber every day or google is getting more and more intrusive for your privacy forcing them to insert privacy-threatening backdoors in their coding. For more and more apps are becoming slave to google libraries, forcing users to stay signed in to google all the time and to keep the play store running all the time. If you don't do both, like this app they all refuse to run on your device.</p>

      <p>1. If you navigate away from the dialer to look up something, you can't get back to it. Even going to the app has no effect you cant end a call! 2. Many numbers still come up as unknown despite being unknown numbers hidden being turned on in settings. 3. Still slow to show up when phone is ringing. Often gobe to voice mail before i coukd answer. 4. No way to import current block list. Can't believe this isn't done automatically!!! Or even a manual import option! 5. No way to hide scam/tele calls</p>

      <p>I was told by cricket wireless cell phone service that you are affiliated with the service but, I don't understand why you allow phone calls to get through my phone service and when I call back they're not in service. They should be blocked by the app not by me. And yet you want to be paid for a service that you can't provide!! You should be able to look into the data base and know for sure if a number is in service before I get a call.</p>
