      <p>I love this app it has all the games I want and love. The problem is it gives so little credits to play with ,I don't want to log on with my email address . Other game apps give enough for you to play an enjoy there games come on you surely can do better . I'm not paying to get credits to play an I don't do it on the other games either,,but they give enough to play there games</p>

      <p>Been disappointed lately. Love playing the slots but lose more than I win. Can't afford to keep buying chips to play. Especially since you don't get a lot of chips for the money. Wish they offered better deals. Tonight I see that Doubledown Casino has changed my level down to One and the measly points I had disappeared. I'm back to white diamond level when I had been yellow diamond. I've been playing for years! I feel cheated anymore. This use to be my favorite app. Very unhappy.</p>

      <p>Y'all are some tightwads, I mean wow. These slots are hungry and will gobble up all of your coins with no remorse whatsoever. It's so bad they have to give out free coins so people will play their game. Whatever you do don't use your real money to buy fake money that can't make money. Loss after loss kinda takes all the fun out of it. 🫤</p>

      <p>Collected 2,600.000 in free play, lost 26 spins in a row. How in the world can I possibly rate this above a one star. Random number generated they say How about fixed. Why in the world would I pay to play if losing 26 in a row is something even possible. It's a shame because a lot of the slots are fun to play here.</p>

Let the players win when they should. ! Balance out and you will keep loyal players longer! Still feel like there's more take then give. I try to b optimistic in playing games with double down but still feel like they r greedy and don't care about the player ever winning!Would love to play everyday but u can't play if u don't get to win ever!</p>

You can’t possible bet 10k on 5 mil in chips and lose 90% of time … and have winner combinations under 20k.   Congrats - you make me no longer ever (ever ever) want to go to a casino and play slots.

      <p>I have to log into FB every single day to be able to play.  It’s frustrating and it isn’t my permissions on FB.  They are working on it but it has been at least 3 months.  The daily spin should be better.  It takes forever to tier up.  I love to play but it’s really just taking our money with less rewards all the time.</p>

      <p>I like playing but not the rewards. Some of the games have little to no payout no matter how long you play. 
I’ve lost money by accidentally pressing the Max bet while trying to spin. There should be a button to disable the Max Bet or move it from by the spin button.
Also brought 99.00 worth of chips, and a few minutes later they went on sale. I would like notice of impending sales so I can get the best for my buck.
Other than those issues, I enjoy the app.</p>

But now it’s just all about how much real money Double Down can get from us. The bonus rounds that use to be so fun to play are few and very far between. If they show up at all! And when we do buy credits, and let’s be real about this, it is JUST CREDITS not Real money that you play with, the games have been sooo bad that the $100 we send is gone in an hour. Needless to say we don’t have gambling night anymore. WE CAN’T AFFORD IT!!!!</p>

If I go on my phone to my email on phone. I get the bonus only on phone. So here’s my dilemma, I had over $150M on my phone. I had to delete program on my phone because of internet problems. When I reloaded, this version is not the same. The appearance of the front page is different in the app. And I lost my money now. I only have $4M now. Anyone else have this issue. Were you able to resolve and how? There is no icon that looks like the one I had in the App Store. I also was a Pink Diamond level and now I’m back to start. No friends in this one either.</p>

      <p>Don’t waste your time building points and chips. They just randomly steal it all back after a year or so. They have done this to me twice in the last 4 years.
Bye Bye😡</p>

      <h4>Fun slots, 4 stars (Mimi DML, Apple App Store, 2024-10-26)</h4>
      <p>I have been playing DoubleDown for years. It is a fun game. I play nearly every day and enjoy all the different kinds of slots that are available. You are not limited (at least when I started, I don’t know if it is still that way) to one or 2 slots until you have played awhile. I do not like that you have stipulations on if you can play big money rooms but I still play every day almost and enjoy most of the games.
My only down is I have never won big but I also play free. I can’t afford to pay to play. So maybe the winners are all the people who play big.</p>

      <p>Typical ploy once you have millions.  They turn off the bonuses and payouts from most slots that you cannot remain consistent in your winnings.  Takes all winnings back just to encourage you to buy more coins.  I was at the top and as I keep spinning, no more winnings regardless of changing games or adjusting amounts.  Took it all back!  Keep it!</p>
