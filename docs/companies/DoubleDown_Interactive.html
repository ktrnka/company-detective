      <p>I love playing but I have one complaint. I would like the play max button moved. I keep losing my chips because the grand kids hit it and I don't realize my bet was changed. And of course when I go from a 200 dollar bet to 24 million that breaks my playing. I'm sure I'm not the only one this happens to. Anyway I love the games and really enjoy playing.</p>

      <p>Wow. Kudos for really making an effort to improve this game app! Last post gave the game 3 stars only because the selections of games were good. I was never really able to play because of how fast I would go through tokens without any wins and considered deleting this app. Gift tokens have increased and I noticed that the games are not so tight. I'm jumping you up to a 5 star and a recommendation to download this app! Good job Double Down!</p>

      <p>I'd recommend it, possibly the best slot game I've tried thus far. But they do a great job of keeping it interesting along with bonuses and other side games. Definitely receive a good portion of daily rewards for logging in, keep an eye once you catch a steady groove just like the real thing money can easily come & go!

      <p>Games are fun but trying to win and actually keep chips is hard as heck. I've been playing for 10 + years and have yet to win a jackpot! The highest I've ever got was 500,000 no matter what game, how long or how many chips I play the chips disappear in minutes. Trying to keep it high enough to be able to play for a hour or so is next to impossible. I guess if you spend loads of money it can be done but, I don't have extra money to throw away.</p>

      <h4>My thoughts, 5 stars (VanCheryl, Apple App Store, 2024-11-05)</h4>
      <p>I’ve also been a long time fan and player of DD ( referring to July 30 review) I love the app and the realness of its game offers I Do play my favorite as the one I love at my local casino for years Secrets of the Forest DD/Pixies of the Forest 
And I have a real problem with the way it all the sudden cuts off and I have played this game for years intensely yeppers but this is ridiculous yall I don’t understand why it’s a shutdown if I’m playing it’s Still on your app and doesn’t that count lol seriously and yes I know and realize I’m just one little nothing in the magnitude of subscribers and others have been years longer I believe I wasn’t too far behind the 2 year anniversary of original subscription 🤷‍♀️
But I know I’ve been fairly a Grateful one and always been respectful and try to show appreciation for the perks and blessings via random emails of thanks and thanks for the freebies when rec it’s really nice I even cried when yall once sent a 250 chip bonus for  “ my meaning something as a fan “ I’d never had anything in real life as an acknowledgement to my mattering  but anyway I’m just not understanding why it’s only when I’m on my secrets yall stop it I am not an expert but I Do Know that game literally almost every system of the combos it has and know what how it is when it’s all the sudden shut down the program 
Anyway I’m sorry I’m just really irritated by it this morning so I just wanted to make it valid to myself I guess and knowing I’m probably gonna be banned out and that’s the risk of trying to be more assertive in my life and I still love yall DD and Thank you for all the years of fun and you’ve helped me through some really tough hard times and I will always appreciate that! 
Be Blessed and yeah I would still recommend you to anyone 🔥👍</p>

      <h4>Not Enough Chips, 3 stars (Tortsthoughts, Apple App Store, 2024-11-05)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been playing this game for many years…and always have place large bets.  I used to be able to win more chips, and also be gifted more chips.  Now you have to go through too many steps to get too few chips.  I’m lucky to get 1 or 2 bets with what I get.   It’s no fun to play when chips run out after a few spins.  Friends gifts are consistently paltry.  And now the games where you have to build up something before you win is so frustrating, as you need lots of chips to keep betting.</p>

      <p>I’m sure you know by now that the last update has made it so that you can’t open it. It starts to load & then it just stops. So much for keeping all my apps up to date🤦🏻‍♀️.
I’ve had this app for YEARS….this last update gets thumbs down 👎🏻 from me because since I “updated” the app, it doesn’t load, I can’t send a message from in the app because I can’t get in. I can only hope that there’s no response to this because you’re too busy trying to fix this problem 🤞🏻! Hope to hear back from you soon 🙏🏻.</p>

I’m willing to buy points and have - repeatedly, but then blow through those points within a few dozen spins takes away from the enjoyment of the app.</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing this game for years and I was so disappointed and I would say the last two months have been the best ever. I’m so excited. I can’t wait to play this game every day all day. All I can say is it’s been amazing last couple of months. Wow give us and you take us away. I give the best review I probably ever given. It had been totally amazing soon as I gave the review. I started losing everything again and not winning a dime. I’m so sad because this is my most favorite game. I shouldn’t have to spend money to have fun playing a game. I wish I could go back to just winning a little bit here and there and being able to do the daily challenges.</p>

If you continue to play the same slot you will also lose your money. Play these games for fun but expect to lose in the end.</p>

You can’t win or get a bonus spin for any thing!  But win they let you win, they want you to rate the game!   Wis you could win more, so you can get better ranked! Sometimes the wheel will jump or it will tell you to recount!  I will you could just leave the settings alone, so the people that spend money to get coins, can actually play for more then one or two days!  So sad you have to do this to everyone!

      <p>I have been playing DoubleDown for years. It is a fun game. I play nearly every day and enjoy all the different kinds of slots that are available. You are not limited (at least when I started, I don’t know if it is still that way) to one or 2 slots until you have played awhile. I do not like that you have stipulations on if you can play big money rooms but I still play every day almost and enjoy most of the games.
My only down is I have never won big but I also play free. I can’t afford to pay to play. So maybe the winners are all the people who play big.</p>

      <p>I’ve had this game for years, bought coin packages etc at times.  After a while you start to get the same repetitive feeling, the games only objective is to get you back to the store to buy more.  There’s no incentive for the game to let you have any type of big wins after it figures out your play style over a period of playing.  Then it’s just all about trying to sell you coins.  I guess that’s gambling though!</p>

      <p>I have beenPlaying for quite a few years. In the beginning, it was a lot of fun, but things have changed. I have noticed patterns that I feel is manipulative. Example,I will get a good spin, and then the app asks you to rate themAnd if you say no thanks or remind me later you start losing. The only time you don’t lose your chips in a flat second is if you rate them and you rate them good.
I know I have said this before but unfortunately things are not getting better they’re getting worse so I may have no choice but to go onto a different app and just delete double down which is too bad because I really did enjoy playing some of the games, but there are nothing but discouraging anymore</p>

      <p>I have been  playing this game many years and not sure why? You are stingy with the bonus wheel and have now started using it for gifts. All but three of my friends have stopped playing. Another slot on fb gives at least a million coin every 2 hours and even more about every third spin, they have a wheel spin where you can get up to 30 mil, it takes me all day to even gather 3/4 million to play on your game and play usually lasts less than 15 min before I am broke again. I don’t purchase chips because it would be a huge waste of my money. I used to get free chips on email but you stopped that for whatever reason and I could not get them started again, so I used another email and got the verification email with the standard gift but have never received another email from you, so you tell me, why should I continue to play your game????</p>

      <p>I’ve played this app for a number of years, and it has changed along the way. First, I enjoy it! I play it daily, but  I can only
afford to buy chips once every 2 months. I appreciate the artistry of the slot game creators. Over time the games have gotten “tighter” in payouts, bonus games winning zero, payouts in general tight. Just like the REAL casino I visit on occasion. However, I stick to my budget, cut my bets back and wait for the free chip emails to keep me going til I can make my next purchase. So, all in all, I really like this game and have been loyal by keeping it for at least 8 years to date.</p>

      <h4>Trash, 1 stars (Apple App Store, 2024-10-08)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been playing this game for a little while I’ve bought coins and lost them quick. I just recently spent 40 bucks for 30 million coins here’s how it went. 37 spins zero wins 38th I got my bet back 41 spins zero wins 42 got my net back then spun out to zero coins. All this in 5 minutes. So 40 bucks got me 4 minutes of playing time where I spun over 80 times winning my bet back twice then broke. I’ll let you decide how fair this app is cause I feel robbed and I’m shocked apple sticks by all of this.  Going to add a little more to this.  Cause I just spent 40 more bucks and the outcome is hilarious.  I played a game where I was losing just about every spin then I hit a bonus that paid me 17 million coins. Yay right um no it cost me 23 million coins to win that 17 then they sent me a message saying hey that’s a big win you want to leave feedback.  I was thinking um for what losing 6 million on this game. After that hit I went to another game where I spun 100 times winning only 4 spins and those wins where very small. So the moral of my story is your big wins will be coins you have already loss to them then after that they think you hit big so they will not let you win again.  It’s trash and disgusting how they operate.  I wish there was a layer that could sue these creeps.</p>

I have been playing for 5 years or more and have never won a Jackpot playing the Wild Cherry game.
Also, I never buy chips anymore either.</p>

      <p>Used to love playing double down daily. Really looked forward to the rewards, bingo for extra chips, etc. Now the betting levels are so high, they are unattainable.

The “seasons” daily challenges, etc., are so much higher, I am not able to play near as often, and of course, the payouts when you do win, or get a bonus, often don’t even cover your bet.  They could do better.</p>

      <p>I enjoy the variety of games Double Down provides but when they double charged me for chips that I bought, I disputed the the second charge from Xsolla and my money was returned and I received an email from them acknowledging the double charge. When I tried to buy some chips after that, they blocked my ability to buy chips, stating there were “irregularities “ when there were none. So be aware that Xsolla is not a credible payment system and will black ball you if you dispute their charges.
Also, I have noticed over time, that they’re payouts on most games are diminishing and bonuses are fewer and far between.</p>

      <h4>Great Games but Don’t Waste Your Money, 2 stars (teudiosensi, Apple App Store, 2024-10-06)</h4>
      <p>Double Down offers the best games available. It is fun to play fun to collect tokens when the opportunity allows and most importantly it is a form of entertainment if you enjoy playing slot machine games. This is especially true if due to injury or old age you are no longer able to go to a real casino. 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS WHERE FUN ENDS!!
I have no problem buying what many would say are useless tokens because they are a waste of money. 
Lately they have been a definite waste of money.
Should you be fortunate enough to be able to buy tokens Double Dawn has made the slots so tight you can lose 150 million in less than 45 minutes. Buying 500,000,000 for $100 and losing that much in just a few minutes there is NO value vs the reward of having fun. Literally you could waste 50 million tokens and never see a bonus round.
If Double Down wants me and others to play let us play. 
Loosen the games. Until then I will save my money and find something better to do with my cash.</p>

      <p>Some of the slots are lame and not fun to play while others ore fun to play. Most of the slots give very little and take a lot. If you do get a good sized win. The next turns are designed to take it all back. I once had a winning streak on one of the new slots. The next day the game was removed and all of my next plays in the other gamesb took all of the my winnings away. You have to play every day otherwise you don’t receive the return points. The bingo game within the game awards you 2 numbers each day. Sometimes you win additional numbers. I once saved up a lot of numbers. I played all of the numbers and did not win. The next day the game cleared all of my numbers I did get on the bingo card.</p>

      <p>I appreciate that you guys do have some of the best casino slots on here but there is one problem, you guys aren’t an actual casino. Here is the problem, you get a minimum of $30,000 credits every hour but your most popular game’s minimum are $10,000. So I only get 3 spins an hour at that rate. Oh yeah I forgot about the daily spin and that gives me the only real opportunity to have enough credits to play maybe 10 spins. Guys, please don’t treat this like an actual casino because here nobody here actually wins anything but the house.</p>

      <p>This is crazy: Now, instead of keeping you signed in so you can just open the app every time you want to play it, you are now required to sign in every single time you open the app! What has that done? Well, it has certainly discouraged people from using the app. I have several friends who play the app, and we would exchange "gifts" in the app every day. Not anymore. I might get 2 to 4 of them now. This means that the number of people using the app has dropped a lot, simply because it requires you to sign in every time. Pretty stupid move, Double Down. I imagine you are losing players like crazy now.
I contacted them about it and received a canned generic email from them that did not even address the question. It had one suggestion that was a possibility, to delete the app and re-install it, so I tried that. It made no difference. So, apparently this is not a glitch! Apparently, they now purposely want us to sign in every single time we open the app. I am considering quitting this app now, even though I have played it for years. Other casinos don’t require you to sign in every time you open the app. That used to be the case with Double Down Casino, too. Not anymore.</p>

      <p>Can not win any coin. They want you to just spend your money. The slots are nice but you end up losing all your coin and they only give you 300,00 free coin or free games that don’t end up winning anything. Spent 40.00 and couldn’t even win.  I won’t spend anymore money on this app.</p>

      <h4>Finally!! A Scarab Bonus Round!, 3 stars (Flacoinohio, Apple App Store, 2024-09-19)</h4>
      <p>On December 25, 2020 I played Scarab and won a Bonus round. I was only betting $36k per spin so the win was only $236k. Today, March 5, 2024 I played Scarab as I have for the past 53 days and finally spun a Bonus round, in fact I won a second round during the first round of spins! I bet $1.5 million per spin today when the first Bonus came up. It’s ironic my winnings amounted to $236 million credits. I chose the five spin option with ten Scarab wild icons being put in each spin. I have not spun a Bonus round in the Scarab game for 4 years, 2 months, and 5 days. Its amazing how long it takes to get a Bonus Round in the Scarab game. I am betting the next 8-15 ten spin rounds will produce no winning spins, wild scarab icons, or princess icons, and my current winnings will be gone. Here’s to counting how long it takes to spins another Bonus round! Now I am eager to see how much longer it takes to spin a full screen of Princess icons, I haven’t seen one of those since the game was first released. I just bought the $39.99 package and it says it’s two days of bonus spins. Two days means 48 hours to me, I didn’t get 48 hours the last three times. I had 1 day and 2 hours at 3:47 PM this afternoon. At 4:30 Am my bonus spin time was over. You all owe me some free spins or more time. Your not giving 24 or 48 hours.  The card collecting game makes no sense either.  I started a new card collecting game and after collecting 5 cards, I only received those same cards for a month.  Then got 7 in a row to 12 and again got zero new cards until I spent real money buying play credits.  After spending $1million or more on spins I won for a minute or two and earned 85 cards I have won cards 37 times and earned no new cards.</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing since this game came out. It use to be so much fun and you could actually win but something has definitely changed now. I keep the company more rich as much as I spend and I can’t do it anymore. So frustrating!!!
I love playing DDC but buying the 99.00 dollar package to lose it within 15 minutes is ridiculous. I understand DDC has to make money but good grief loosen up the slots some. They tell you not to bet so much and I’ve tried that too but they still don’t pay off. In the economy we live in now I have got to stop buying the packages. 

Thanks DDC for the years of fun but I’m at the point it’s time to delete the app and find something else to play.</p>

      <p>I have to agree with a lot of these reviews. I have been pretty for several years and have learned to not expect more than two weeks of winning and then three weeks of losing. I’m a retired old lady and on a fixed income and can’t afford to buy extra chips, so I just play with what comes up. But it’s disappointing when you haven’t played for a couple of hours only to find you have been disconnected and your time bonus won’t go past 20K. 
Also I can’t sign up for extra because I get a message that my email is already registered.

I am tired of never winning and it just isn’t fun anymore when you take take take.

Additionally, I have experienced a lot more technical problems like freeze ups or spinning into infinity that require exiting the app.  I also get many Load Game failures while linking from an emailed invitation.

      <p>I’ve invested thousands over 10 years and have never felt like I was really winning. I think unless you play millions at a time, you don’t win. I think the “contests” to play certain games to win are set to let only the really big bettors win! They sell packages of chips for people who bet big (really big, like over several hundred million) so that makes me think that you might favor the big bettors more than the smaller betters like me. Do you rotate the winners equally? I mean, do as many smaller bettors win as often as bigger bettors win? I like the games: they’re fun, entertaining and usually interesting. I just don’t like the percentage of payouts for us smaller bettors!</p>

Free spins are RIDICULOUS: (on a 12k amount chosen by the app ) and then you win 6,600 in 30 spins, seriously??
It’s not even worth my time to wait for the free spins to be over☹️😖. 
There is only (Low) winning amounts on low spins like 10-15k and loosing is all too easy so I’m afraid I will have to delete the game AGAIN for a couple of years and again find a different game that will actually PAY OUT.  What a shame because there are só many games that I love but the payouts stink, where are the jackpots??
———————————————————————————

Update Aug 8th 2024- Game still freezes in piggy game, winning is hard and when you win you lose it faster than the speed of light that is SUCH a shame😞😖 Winnings are bad, you only win big when your bet amount is tiny, never ever won thé jackpot☹️. Played it for years, deleted it cause I got SO frustrated by not winning big, installed again couple of months ago and feel same way now..
Signed up for emails again, free money and free spins.</p>

      <p>This app is a scam. It’s regulated on how much you spend do not buy into it. There are much better games out there to play that don’t cost you as much. They have this game set at 95% loss or greater they treated as if you’re playing with a chance to win real money and I’ve played games that you can win money on that don’t cost near as much. Double down and I GT are not about providing entertainment at a low cost.  it’s high cost to play them with very little return.</p>

When I play now and try to complete the missions, I lose consistently. I have bought $30 worth of coins and it didn’t last a month playing to complete the missions. 
Now I have quit playing the missions and just play for fun, if a slot doesn’t win, I just move along and collect the bonuses.

      <h4>DD game, 5 stars (beckhop, Apple App Store, 2024-08-28)</h4>
      <p>Since it’s really about filling the imagination with idea of betting 10 million dollars but losing it wasn’t fun. I like building my pot then bragging about it as if it’s really a thing.  Thanks for the wins. But I do wish there were more adult like machines.  Not kitty cats, honey bears, mermaids and Harley pigs.  
I stay away from those. Other people like them but I feel like it’s a child’s game. More real to life people in kids games. Just a suggestion. Most of us are seniors.</p>

      <h4>Computer manipulated game, 1 stars (jack21 53628892, Apple App Store, 2024-08-28)</h4>
      <p>This game is computer programmed!!! the spin always pay low so you can keep buying. Crooks taking people money they should be ashamed....be aware and save your money!!!!! The game is rigged. Don’t pay real money for a fake no real payout programmed game. Go to Vegas at least you will have some action when you lose. Be aware scam</p>

      <h4>Mixed bag, 1 stars (Wkess, Apple App Store, 2024-08-27)</h4>
      <p>This is a computer generated casino and they can change the method on payout by flipping the switch. I play often my favorite is the Mermaid and the Piggy what’s amazing about the Mermaid is if your bet is below 
One million you will get the jackpot for a minor but you don’t qualify for it. So you have to bet a million or more in order to qualify for Jackpot minor but you will never get the jackpot minor because they have programmed it out and they will say that’s not so but I’ve ran this so many times and it just does not appear, This is a man made computer program but it is programmed to take you to the cleaners. And They have really gone down hill on this happy hour that is a joke. It can be entertaining at times but I think they too many so called slots and the good slots have been reprogrammed so many times like the Piggy slot 
This slots has changed drastically.</p>

      <p>I really like this game but today I went to put auto spin on so I could answer the door and where the button for auto spin usually is was a bet max button. Lost all my chips on one bet 😢. I know it was my fault but 200 million gone on one spin. Can’t play again for awhile now. So just be careful and have fun all and all it’s a good time</p>

      <p>Such great games but free spins & bonuses are rare, the games just eat your coins. Once in a while a big win comes but I counted over 300 spins & no bonus or free spins came up. That is no fun to play at all!!!</p>

      <p>Love the games.
However, you need a lot of money to maintain a good level of coins to play.
Not enough bonus points to play. Plus the wheel only gives one spin a day and it’s not always big amounts.</p>
