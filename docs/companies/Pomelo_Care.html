        <h1>About Pomelo Care</h1>
<p>Pomelo Care is a virtual maternity care company founded on January 1, 2021, and headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey.

<h2>Acquisition of The Doula Network</h2>
<p>In September 2024, Pomelo Care acquired The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the U.S. This acquisition aims to create a hybrid care model that combines virtual and in-person support, significantly expanding access to high-quality maternity care.
