        <h1>About Pomelo Care</h1>
<p>Pomelo Care is a digital health company founded on January 1, 2021, and headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey. The company specializes in virtual maternity and neonatal care services, aiming to improve maternal and infant health outcomes through a combination of virtual and in-person care. Pomelo Care partners with health plans and employers to offer comprehensive support for pregnancy and newborn care, complementing traditional in-person OB-GYN or midwife care <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pomelo-care">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Pomelo Care's services include a Virtual Maternity Care Program, which provides personalized support throughout the fertility, pregnancy, and postpartum journey. The program offers patients unlimited access to a dedicated care team, including doctors, midwives, nurses, dietitians, and therapists. The company also provides care coordination services, collaborating with in-person healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care <a href="https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Pomelo Care operates on a B2B model, serving employers and health plans. The company has grown significantly, covering over 3 million lives across 46 states as of June 2024. Pomelo Care's services are often available at no cost to members through select employers and health plans <a href="https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $86 million in funding, with the most recent Series B round securing $46 million in June 2024. This funding is intended to expand partnerships with payors and address the root causes of the maternal health crisis <a href="https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Pomelo Care has been recognized for its innovative approach to maternal and neonatal healthcare, being named one of Fierce Healthcare's "Fierce 15" companies for 2024 <a href="https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Marta Bralic Kerns is the founder and CEO of Pomelo Care. She has articulated a clear vision for the company, emphasizing the importance of addressing the maternal health crisis in the U.S. Her leadership is supported by a team that includes Vineeta Agarwala, MD, PhD, from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), who brings valuable expertise in strategic partnerships and investor relations <a href="https://leadiq.com/c/pomelo-care/627008cd1c78b3366676e812">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Funding and Financial Growth</h2>
<p>Pomelo Care has experienced significant financial growth, securing $46 million in Series B financing on June 20, 2024. This round was led by existing investors First Round Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The funding will be used to accelerate partnerships with payors and expand the company's reach <a href="https://www.pomelocare.com/articles/pomelo-care-raises-46-million-and-publishes-data-proving-its-virtual-care-model-improves-outcomes">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Acquisition of The Doula Network</h2>
<p>In September 2024, Pomelo Care acquired The Doula Network, the largest network of credentialed doulas in the United States. This strategic acquisition allows Pomelo to offer a hybrid model of care that combines virtual and in-person services, significantly expanding access to high-quality maternity care <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/pomelo-care-acquires-doula-network-expand-hybrid-maternity-care-model">(Anastassia Gliadkovskaya, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Clinical Outcomes and Research</h2>
<p>Pomelo Care has published peer-reviewed data demonstrating the effectiveness of its care model. At the 2024 ACOG Clinical &amp; Scientific Meeting, the company presented findings showing that its telemedicine care significantly improved rates of evidence-based aspirin prophylaxis and mental health screenings among high-risk populations <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pomelo-care-publishes-peer-reviewed-data-demonstrating-significant-impact-of-its-virtual-maternal-health-care-model-302328938.html">(Pomelo Care, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Market Position and Competitors</h2>
<p>Pomelo Care operates in a competitive landscape that includes companies like Maven Clinic and Babyscripts. The acquisition of The Doula Network positions Pomelo uniquely as the only maternity care model offering both virtual and in-person services at scale. Recent legislative changes mandating Medicaid reimbursement for doula services present a significant opportunity for Pomelo to expand its market share <a href="https://femtechinsider.com/pomelo-care-acquires-the-doula-network/">(Marta Bralic Kerns, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Pomelo Care is poised for significant growth in the maternal and neonatal healthcare sector, backed by substantial funding and strategic acquisitions. The company's innovative approach to combining virtual and in-person care, along with its commitment to improving clinical outcomes, positions it as a leader in addressing the maternal health crisis in the United States.</p>
