<p>Classmates.com was acquired by United Online in 2004 and later sold to PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, in 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com">(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)</a>. The company generates revenue through paid subscriptions and advertising sales, with a business model that relies heavily on user-generated content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com">(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)</a>.</p>

<p>Classmates.com remains a significant player in the niche of social networking for alumni, despite facing challenges from larger platforms like Facebook.
