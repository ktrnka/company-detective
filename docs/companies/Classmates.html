<li>"after no emails in forever I started getting daily+ emails from. Classmates.com - wanted to at least reduce or choose which emails I'd get, but I guess that's not an option. Way to run your members off your practically pointless website." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/zn5lwq/after_no_emails_in_forever_i_started_getting/">(BJntheRV, Reddit, 2022-12-16)</a></li>
<li>"classmates.com was basically a precursor to Facebook. Back in the late 90s/early 00s it was really the only way to connect with classmates. It's basically useless now, and I guess their attempt to fight that was to start sending out mass emails to anyone who had ever signed up." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/zn5lwq/after_no_emails_in_forever_i_started_getting/j3xrfph/">(BJntheRV, Reddit, 2023-01-11)</a></li>
<li>"It's even worse when you randomly start getting these emails as a Brit living in the EU who has never interacted with the US school system or classmates.com. Looks like someone signed up with the wrong email address, and apparently email verification is something that's beyond technical capabilities in 2024… Fucking amateur hour." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/zn5lwq/after_no_emails_in_forever_i_started_getting/kq4isq8/">(Next-Damage3839, Reddit, 2024-02-12)</a></li>
