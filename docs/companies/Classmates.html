<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: The platform has been instrumental in fostering community ties. A notable example is a mother and daughter duo at Illinois State University who reported that attending school together brought them closer, allowing them to support each other academically and socially <a href="https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2024/05/redbird-legacy-being-classmates-brought-mother-and-daughter-closer-together/">(Illinois State, 2024-05-07)</a>.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>

<li>
<p><strong>Competition</strong>: The social networking space is highly competitive, with platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn also catering to alumni and professional networking. Classmates must continuously innovate to retain its user base.</p>

      <p>I would say that the website classmates.com has the highest membership-to-quality ratio of any website I’ve seen. 

But at least you can use it. 

All the app does is display a picture of two graduates, and the word “loading…”, and that’s it.  

Have reinstalled the app a couple of times, no luck. 

Pathetic.</p>

      <p>Tried to stop my auto pay for renewal and was told I could not get a refund. Very rude young woman hung up on me. Tried to explain that my email address had changed and I had not received any contact for over a year. I graduated nearly 60 years ago! How many of us are left and would anyone remember me or even themselves by this point! Forget it! Wehave scattered all over the country and other life events are more important! Anyone wants to find me or anyone else we are in other places on the internet. Don’t bother with this one. Save your money. What a waste. They should be investigated. No customer service at all.</p>

      <p>So much potential, so little effort!  This app is slowly dying from obsolescence.  If you log on it triggers a visit to whoever is the featured person.  They then log on and the cycle continues.  My subscription, turn off auto renewal, has officially expired.  YAY!!</p>

      <p>All subscriptions are auto-renew unless you go into the website and turn it off. 

Not too many of my classmates are active so Facebook turned out to be a better way of reaching out.

I would get notifications that someone visited my profile but I never could find out who they were.

It is easy to load pictures when using the App, but impossible to delete.</p>

      <h4>Waste of Money, 1 stars (T4731, Apple App Store, 2023-07-29)</h4>
      <p>I purchased a subscription last year without researching this app (shame on me) as my 40th HS reunion was coming up.  Unfortunately, virtually no one uses this app.  Welp, they renewed the subscription this year without sending a reminder that it’s renewing. I completely understand why because that’s the only way they’re going to get more subscription money. I sent an email to their administrator to cancel my subscription and refund my money. Nothing but crickets!
Do yourself a favor and save your hard earned money and skip getting this garbage.</p>

      <h4>This could be great, 1 stars (cheese burger deluxe, Apple App Store, 2022-11-15)</h4>
      <p>TBH this app could be great as it would separate and cater to only your school and classmates who attended. But with social media giants like Facebook and IG that are free, there really is no point in this app. Also, you can’t speak to a human or troubleshoot or get a refund. The app and website are trash and don’t work unless you pay. Then you pay and it works a little more but still doesn’t. It’s like a dating app. When you sign up for free then you get all these notifications like 5-10 times a day saying someone checked out your profile get premium to find out who! And with a low price of 3 dollars, I’m like sure why not? Once you pay premium you see that it’s basically a scam as you’ve never heard of or can even see a picture of the alleged people who messaged you or came to your profile. I signed up and am class of ‘03, tell me why the website has me as class of ‘01? Because no one in my class that went to my school uses this website platform!!! So it’s bogus and a scam as the website fraudulently emails you as if it’s real people. If you want a refund dispute with your bank.</p>
