        <h1>About Disney</h1>
<p>The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Burbank, California. It is a leading multinational entertainment and media conglomerate, operating through various segments such as Media Networks, Parks, Experiences and Products, Studio Entertainment, and Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International. As of 2024, Disney employs approximately 223,000 people worldwide, making it one of the largest employers in the entertainment industry <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-75-staffers-abc-news-stations-1236165850/">(Variety, 2024-10-02)</a>.</p>
<p>Disney generates revenue through a diverse range of products and services, including television networks, theme parks, film studios, and streaming services. The company primarily operates in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space, catering to a global audience with its entertainment offerings. Disney's products are distributed through various channels, including direct sales at theme parks, digital platforms like Disney+, and traditional media outlets.</p>
<p>Over the years, Disney has evolved from a small animation studio into a global entertainment powerhouse. The company is known for its iconic characters, theme parks, and a vast library of films and television shows. Third parties often describe Disney as a leader in family entertainment, while the company itself emphasizes its commitment to creating magical experiences for its audience.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy is a notable executive at Disney, serving as the president of Lucasfilm since its acquisition by Disney in 2012. She has played a significant role in the expansion of the Star Wars franchise into both film and television. Despite facing criticism from fans, Kennedy has been instrumental in shaping the creative direction of the franchise <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/">(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Financial Performance and Layoffs</h2>
<p>Disney has been undergoing significant restructuring to address financial challenges. This includes layoffs affecting around 75 staffers at ABC News and local stations, as part of broader cost-cutting measures across the company. This follows a trend of job reductions, with about 300 jobs cut in various corporate departments in late September 2024. The company is adapting to a rapidly changing media landscape, where traditional TV viewership is declining in favor of streaming services <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-75-staffers-abc-news-stations-1236165850/">(Variety, 2024-10-02)</a>.</p>
<h2>Partnerships and Agreements</h2>
<p>In September 2024, Disney reached a new agreement with DirecTV, restoring access to Disney's channels, including ESPN and ABC, after a dispute over carriage fees. This agreement allows DirecTV customers to include Disney's streaming services in select packages, reflecting a shift towards more flexible subscription options <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/directv-disney-agreement-channels-restored/">(CBS News, 2024-09-14)</a>.</p>
<h2>Disney Parks and Experiences</h2>
<p>Disney's theme parks, particularly Walt Disney World in Florida, continue to be a major draw for tourists. Recent weather events, including Hurricane Milton, have led to temporary closures of certain resorts and attractions. Disney has implemented flexible cancellation policies for guests affected by the storm, demonstrating a commitment to customer service during emergencies <a href="https://allears.net/2024/10/07/is-disney-world-closing-for-hurricane-milton/">(AllEars, 2024-10-07)</a>.</p>
<h3>New Developments in Parks</h3>
<p>Disney has recently introduced new merchandise lines and themed experiences at its parks. For instance, a new merchandise line specific to Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa was launched, showcasing the company's focus on enhancing guest experiences through unique offerings <a href="https://wdwnt.com/">(WDW News Today, 2023-12-20)</a>.</p>
<h2>Disney's Streaming Services</h2>
<p>Disney+ has been a significant focus for the company, with recent announcements about new features such as continuous playlists aimed at enhancing user experience. This move is part of Disney's strategy to retain subscribers amid a competitive streaming landscape, where Disney+ subscriptions peaked at 164 million in late 2022 but have since declined to around 153 million <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/">(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)</a>.</p>
<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
<p>Disney has shifted its content strategy towards streaming, with a focus on original programming. The success of shows like "The Mandalorian" has been pivotal, although recent series such as "The Acolyte" have faced mixed reviews and lower viewership, prompting questions about the future direction of the Star Wars franchise <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/star-wars-disney-analysis-ratings-box-office-1236011620/">(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-10-03)</a>.</p>

      <p>Warning! When you accept the terms and conditions, Disney are doing some scummy tactics where they are making you agree to not sue them for anything. A guys wife died at one of their parks and Disney tried to argue that he could sue them since he had signed up for a free trial to Disney plus. Google it and sign up at your own risk!</p>

      <p>05.10.24 Looks like Disney+ no longer supports 1st gen Google Chromecast devices. Thanks a bunch. 20.09.24 update but Chromecast still doesn't work. No longer able to cast to Chromecast device. Seems to have happened since 09.09.24 update. Can stream to phone, but I don't want to watch movies on a small device. When attempting to cast, get to see the Disney splash screen with the doughnut of death spinning for about a minute, and then the app returns an "error loading content" message</p>

It takes awhile to get your characters built up, but the more you play, the more fun it gets.

The only thing the developers haven't thought of yet, is having the ability to customize where the time, pause button, skill button, and shuffle button are, to make switching between a handheld or phone, and a tablet, easy.</p>

      <h4>Error 12, 1 stars (callida88, Apple App Store, 2024-07-28)</h4>
      <p>Update 2: basically a month now and still no response from the developers and no fix. Hopefully the next update will resolve things but to get absolutely no acknowledgment of this ongoing problem is extremely disappointing and (while this is perhaps silly) it feels really disrespectful towards all of the people who have spent years playing this game.

Update: it’s been over two weeks and I still can’t access the game, it’s error code 12 every time

I’ve been playing this game for 8 years, and across multiple devices because of the ease of having it linked to my Apple account. I guess I’m paying for that ease now because I’m completely locked out of the app! Every time I attempt to open it I’m met with the same error message saying that, “In order to play with this game data, you’ll need an SNS account that was linked with the data.” Well, I didn’t have that because the game had previously told me I could keep my data attached to my Apple account instead and since I can’t open the app to attach another account now I guess I’m just locked out until they fix it, which I hope they do. I genuinely thought this was the perfect mobile game, if I had to choose just one game to keep on my phone it would’ve been this. Too bad I guess I’ll never play it again since it just won’t open 🤷🏼‍♀️</p>

I sent multiple requests for assistance both though developer contact in Apple Store and once I finally got into the game on July 2.

Nothing for the many of us affected after that time, including the time periods of 06/30 to 07/04. So much disrespect for long time players</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing this game for about 2 years now, but about a year ago I started running into issues with login. It wasn’t consistent, so I just ignored it. The past few months, however, have changed that. I have not been able to log into the game in about four months because every time the game tells me that it failed to connect to the server, and that I need to check my internet connection. I’ve done enough internet checks to know that my internet is fine, and that the problem is in the game. I’m not sure what it is, but I would like for it to be fixed, because I used to really enjoy this game and it’s characters.</p>

I’m nervous to uninstall, I’ve always used my app with my apple game center login and don’t want to risk possible retrieval by deleting and reinstalling. What a way to kick off the “celebration raffle”…. When I tried to login with my Apple ID I got “error code 18” with no explanation of what that even means!</p>

      <h4>After playing this for almost a decade…, 5 stars (GiveusyourmoneyNOW, Apple App Store, 2024-07-02)</h4>
      <p>I am a Tsum Tsum veteran with many years of manually sending hearts every hour that I could.  I want to thank all my friends who I met through Line, FaceBook, and Discord who helped me throughout my experience with this wonderful game and want the world to know that it will always be one of the best games I had ever played.  This is coming from a guy who was playing console games since the 1980’s, only to give up all of gaming in order to play this for the last 6 years.  My only real disappointment with this game is the manual heart receiving.  You have to manually accept hearts sent to you within the hour it was issued from a friend for 200 coin each, and the option to accept all of it at once does not automatically return hearts to all senders; you literally have to sit there for as long as it takes and accept one by one in order to return everything that has been sent.  It totally could have had an auto-return option, even if it was a monetary (or gem) purchase option, but no, they left it without auto-returning hearts for 10 years.  Still, I like the fact that you start off with so little, and then build your way to buy random characters from a box, a premium box, a special box, a limited prize-ball machine, and free gifts every now and then.  Oh, the memories.  As I edge closer to retirement from this game, as can attest to the interesting annual events with different themes, new characters from many Disney movies and shows, each with their own special move that includes colorful graphics.  Not bad from a game where you have to match and clear stuffys!  Long live Disney TsumTsum!</p>

      <p>I have been playing this game for years.  It was very relaxing for me and I had over 100 tsum tsums and I don’t know how much I spent to get special characters.  They just did an update and now it looks like everything is lost. I’m an adult playing this game, I can’t imagine if a child is playing and how they would feel losing all they played with what was a very fun game that could be played without paying big bucks.  Also recently it seems AI is running this game and making game playing harder with less prizes.  You also purchase bonuses without knowing what the bonuses are or if you received them.  For now I can not recommend this game.  😢😢😢</p>

I tried to see if any of my other log ins were tied to the game, but they were not. So I left myself logged in under Facebook and gave up and decided to start over. I then got the message to re update to get all my old data back. So I did. Now I can’t even play the game as I was logged in under Facebook before the second download (I didn’t know I would have to log out first) and now I just “Error 13” because I can’t log in to Line. I’m so annoyed by this whole situation so I try to report this issue. Because this game is free, I can’t. Was a great game in the past, such a shame :(</p>

So I saw the thing about the new update and I didn’t have an account so I asked my mom what to do. She said I should turn off auto updates and take a screen recording of all the tsums and stuff I had. I do have a video but the game updated anyway. What should I do. Also will there be a way to get all the raffle tickets that people without accounts are missing? Again I know you’ll probably get a lot of reviews about this but I just want to know if there’s anything I should do.</p>

      <h4>Change to original review/Lost years of play, 4 stars (M Maru, Apple App Store, 2024-06-29)</h4>
      <p>I wrote the original review below a few days ago, with 1 star, when we lost years of play. Apparently there had been a glitch in a recent download by the developer. Although no one contacted us to let us know the glitch had been resolved, we are now able to get back in the game with no loss of coins, gems or characters. This is a fun game to play, and as long as there are no glitches, it’s worth playing. I just wish the developer would have let us know that the issue had been resolved, instead of me finding out at the time we thought we were going to have to start the game from scratch. But thanks for retrieving all lost data.

This morning I played 5 hearts, like we’ve been doing for years. I came back about an hour later, and all my game history is gone. The game is making us start from the beginning. There was a new download so I don’t know if this screwed things up, but I hope they are able to recover my account. I had purchased gems. We won’t start all over. Too much lost time. Customers lost.</p>

      <p>Okay, so I’ve been playing this game for SO long and it’s just been so addicting! I’ve been playing for over 9 years and I CANNOT put it down! The characters in this game are SO cute! I don’t know if I should be concerned that I’ve been playing this for so long… but it’s nothing bad. This is a pretty good game! The developers definitely made it as addicting as possible. There has been no issues for me, so I’m happy they’ve all been patched.  Five stars, would recommend.</p>

      <p>Constantly crashing. No way to add friends in game. You need a whole other app to add friends with the Line app which is just as bad. While it’s a fun game, I do not recommend. Uninstalled today along with the Line app because the game is completely unstable and constantly crashes. It crashed today during an event and I lost my coins, the hearts, and the win. I’m done.</p>

      <p>I have been playing this game since August 2014. Mostly, it’s great. But I just found out they did some shady, sneaky, underhanded, gross thing. I had all Tsums until now because the game didn’t announce they added a new Tsum. For YEARS, new Tsums have ONLY been added in events and Premium Boxes. The game HID Daruma Mickey in a Select Box, not announcing that it was NEW to USA players. And now I am missing it because I thought it would be added in an event or Premium Box. The game needs to allow US players who didn’t know a second chance to get the Daruma Mickey. It’s so gross and underhanded not to announce they added it as a new Tsum.</p>

      <p>I love this Game I have played it since right after it came out my only issue that I found is when changing over devices and when y’all started adding being able to link LINE to Facebook to Apple well when I had an Apple phone you know I already had issues getting into my LINE so now I had a new game on Apple and I couldn’t combined the both of the games because it said I already had stuff on there and it was the same thing with Facebook because the Facebook was linked through my android phone which has been a frustration the other is there are so many characters now and it just seems that they don’t give out new characters very often whenever I go to buy them and then leveling them up with skill is very hard because there are so many characters and when I got to looking on Reddit and seeing for certain characters how many times you have to get that character to level it up to its full skill level it’s almost impossible for people that don’t want to have to go and put money on Google play or have to spend money on the game through the App Store which a lot of people can’t and I was wondering if these are some things that that y’all might be able to take into consideration other that I absolutely love the game.</p>

      <h4>Not Rewarded For Playing, 3 stars (Rani.—, Apple App Store, 2024-02-21)</h4>
      <p>I’ve played this game for 6+ years because of how cute the effects were on some Tsums and because of the limited events.  There’s always something to do on this game and lot to look forward to. 

    Unfortunately as you’re leveling up [for context I’m on level 132] the rewards decrease tremendously. Eventually you’ll be given one ruby for every level you pass. Which is weird since it used to be a variety of either skill tickets, premium tickets, and multiple rubies. Also doesn’t help that it takes longer to fill up the bar so you’d think you’d be rewarded handsomely for reaching the next level. 

    Another problem I noticed was the bingo cards. The rewards don’t really match the difficulty. I’ve gotten better bingo rewards on the 1-3 star (easy) cards vs. the 4-5 star (challenging) cards. Shouldn’t the prizes get better based on the difficulty of the cards? Why wouldn’t the players get better prizes on the hardest cards. Especially since you’re encouraged to spend rubies to make them easier. 

    Other than that, the game is still enjoyable & consistent after years of playing and there’s always something to do. Whether it’s the bingo card, time limited events, the coloring book, or the exclusive monthly cards for certain Tsums. I hope they continue to make updates and put care into it.</p>

      <p>I have played this game off and on for over seven years. Game wise, it is a great app with great graphics. The game play is fun. However, it is next to impossible to get new tsum tsum. I have spent millions of coins and never get to open the new tsums. This makes the game not fun and is why I often quit playing. Coins are difficult to earn, and it is frustrating when you open box after box of the same low scoring tsum that isn’t really relevant to the game. It is time they overhaul this game play. Skilling up tsums takes a ridiculous amount of coins and time. This game is not going to last much longer if they don’t shake it up and change the way tsums are earned. Please change the way tsums are earned.</p>

I have spent quite a lot of funds to get rubies to either get hearts to play or to just purchase coins so I could get a premium box during the so called “lucky time”… Currently this is the 7th BOX I’ve opened that is a tsum I already have!!! This is totally unacceptable considering the myriad of characters you have that I continue to get the same ones over and over! It’s false advertising and I believe anyone that feels as strongly as I do should join e in filing suit against your company for said false advertising! 
I demand a refund of some of my many purchases or the different tsums I’ve been deserving all these times I’ve received the same ones at least a dozen times during the so called “lucky time”! Lucky my foot! It’s only lucky for you and the money you scam us out of!</p>

      <h4>Remembered why I stopped playing. Same Lame Tsums, 1 stars (MaaziFarmer, Apple App Store, 2023-10-04)</h4>
      <p>Short story — you will never get the monthly, limited time or special tsums even if you buy multiple boxes a day. nEVER!! 

Last month and the last couple days reminded me why I put this game down 5 years ago and I’m about to give it up again. I’m so tired of lame “Lucky Times” — last month I bought over 60 boxes and got 1 Sept Tsum . Just one. Not even multiples of the same one to level it up. Literally just one.  

This made playing the “you can only use this month’s characters” ridiculous and impossible. 
This month I’ve already purchased at least 5 or 6 boxes (boredom fills my life) and I’ve gotten nothing new. Not 1 new Tsum and not one Oct Tsum even though it’s apparently “lucky time”. What a joke. As I said at the start I put this down for years. Which means dozens of tsums have come out since I last played but I haven’t gotten any of them. The special boxes and gumball machines are just as bad. If there’s a tsum I have and never play, i get multiples of it and nothing else. Nothing new. Nothing special. It’s annoying. This game annoys me. I want my wasted time back so I can fill it with something less annoying.</p>

      <p>It’s pretty much the best game for matching and I play it every day! I just wish they added more new Tsums, Bingo cards, and events but the monthly events are still pretty fun right now. They recycle a lot of abilities but that’s a given as there’s only so much you can do!

The animation is great and there are so many Disney character Tsum Tsums to collect! Join Facebook groups to get hearts from friends through Line.</p>

      <h4>TsumTsum’s are all gone?? Girl BFFR., 2 stars (Maddie Adkins, Apple App Store, 2023-07-16)</h4>
      <p>I adore this game— I used to play this game a lot, for years, and I’ve collected a GOOD amount of characters. Afterwards, I took a break for it, causing me to have to redownload the game and update it as a whole. Because of that, I had to of course log in again. When I came into the game, everything seemed fine. I still had my hearts and rupees that I bought, along with the thousands of coins I earned. It gave me a card to have free access to a new lil guy, so when I got him, that character specifically and Mickey were the only ones I had. Every character I had collected was complete gone. I looked it up, and apparently people have had the same problem with their TsumTsum’s disappearing. This makes me literally not want to play this anymore, and tbh I haven’t since this has happened lol. I don’t know why this occurs, but it’s not cool. I really want my years worth of TsumTsum’s back. :(</p>

      <p>I will start off with saying my family loves this game.. BUT, I give it three stars for two reasons. 1, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and 2 the fact that the issues that so many people have are not being addressed and fix. If you start the game as someone under 13 your account never gets out of the child account. Me sing there’s a ton of things you can’t do on it. Instead of fixing it or letting the child accounts become regular accounts at a certain age, they just don’t care. Customer service just tells you to delete your game and restart it.. which means losing all progress and anyt hing you want have paid for. Also tsum tsums that aren’t available anymore that have been earned. This needs to be fixed asap.</p>

      <h4>Less fun every time, 3 stars (Royal Montgomery, Apple App Store, 2023-06-27)</h4>
      <p>I used to have so much fun playing this game, but it's turned into a really frustrating experience. Right now I'm stuck between bingo and another event because both the bingo and the event card cannot be cleared without using rubies to make the card playable. Card challenges in tsum tsum shouldn't be impossible without rubies, but some of them are, and rubies take a long time to replenish and I'm not paying real money to make a game actually playable. For a long time you could just play the game without playing a card, but now you have to play a card which is not as fun because the missions are impossible without rubies.
The coin cost for the gacha is ridiculously high and there is no way to get rid of tsums you don't want, so if you're trying to get a limited edition tsum from a pickup capsule and you use 30,000 coins per try & never get what you want, you can't even trade or sell back the ones you don't want & you're out of coins. The game also seems to favor certain characters - it's wild to play with a lvl 20 tsum and get the same score you get with a lvl 2 tsum. It needs a lot of work honestly.</p>

I’ve been playing this game since it came out. You used to be able to get new characters and level them up easily. Not anymore. It’s absolutely impossible. Not being able to get new characters takes the fun out of playing because YOU CAN’T PLAY SOME GAMES IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS!

      <p>I have been playing this game for about 3 years.  In fact, it has been my favorite, go to game but it is rapidly losing that title.  When there is ‘lucky  time’ for specific Tsums for the current game, I save my coins & red tickets to purchase at one time.   I have been unsuccessful in attaining even one game related Tsum for the last five or six ‘lucky times’.  Some of the challenges cannot even play w/o the  specific Tsums.  This is very disappointing to say the least.  I realize this is just how the cookie crumbles but again it is very discouraging.  Thank you for allowing me to vent.</p>

      <p>This app doesn’t work. I downloaded it, played the introduction piece, and then it said “extra download” of 470MG needed. I thought, “sure why not, I have over 200GB of free storage left” so clicked “Ok” and an hour and 7 minutes later it had only downloaded 38.83 of the 470MG. So I thought, “maybe I can’t close the app and I have to wait for it to download while the phone app is open and screen unlocked. After staring at my screen for another 15 minutes, and it only moving yo 40.1 out of 470MG, I decided to just give up and delete the app. I was bored and wanted to play the game, so I tried again! Same thing, only I gave up after another 10 minutes and it only making it to 1.7MG of the 470 needed. I never have this issue with any other app that I’ve ever downloaded. They always download super fast! In fact, after I gave up and deleted this one a second time, I downloaded Emoji Blitz, and it was finished downloading and ready to play in under 2 minutes. F this game! Haha</p>

This game can serve to relieve stress or could just be fun to play. My sister plays and so does my husband. As of two months ago after the last update it erased my account. It made me begin from the beginning and I lost all my tsums, the coins and the level which was quite high. A week ago it kicked me out and when I downloaded it again it erased my sister and husband on the game. I tried to reach out to line customer service and they were no help! They kept saying to write all the information about the game and account I had before. I did everything asked of me and unfortunately to no avail.I played this game since 2008 and invested time and money for nothing ! I lost all of them! The people “customer  service” do not want to assist in recuperating loss account or otherwise! It is a lovely game but if you loose the account of have to download it again you will loose all you accomplished in the game! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! 😡</p>

Wish the tasks were more obtainable. Stuck in missions, you can’t move forward. Because of this , play gets boring and monotonous. When you do earn enough (30,000) to get a premium box you get the same characters leveled up. You could have purchased the level up for cheaper on your own, so the 30,000 coins it takes , you lose. I could level up the tsum for less, how is that the same as getting a new Tsum?</p>

      <p>I haven’t played this game in yrs, so I decided to download it again. Once the download was complete I went straight to it. I clicked on the app and it would take me to a white screen for a bit and then it would close out. I tried it again a few more times and still the app would not open. I deleted the app and re downloaded the app and it’s still giving me the same issue. What a complete waste of 30min….was really looking forward to playing this game again but I guess not anymore.</p>

      <p>This is NOT a bubble popper game !!! It’s a super satisfying find (3 alike) and swipe motion type game .   It’s fast paced !! It’s super satisfying !! You play 1 minute rounds and is so great for multitasking !! You never have to devote more than a minute !! AND you get to collect ADORABLE DISNEY Characters!! This is my longest played game !! Since it came out , I play in phases . The finger swiping concept is so satisfying and addicting !!! It gives super sensory type feelies… so great for people with ADHD !! Along with the whole collecting of things but not drawn not like other games such as city building ! It’s close to instant gratification!!! This is the only game I’ve spent real money on . You can get friends and trade hearts but I don’t want that commitment to ruin my game play . I’ve been building my squad organically just by earning hearts and sometimes buying rubies a few times a year.BUT if you want a fast track to lots of in game money power and obtaining characters faster  , the option is there. If you like connecting with people there are plenty of groups you can find to do that with on social media .</p>

      <h4>Lucky Time is a Bunch of Baloney!, 3 stars (UKWCatfan1, Apple App Store, 2022-08-30)</h4>
      <p>Have played this game forever, but the last year or so, it has become increasingly hard to collect the new Tsums. So called “Lucky Time” is rarely lucky. For the latest event, after grinding to buy probably 40 or 50 boxes, I got 2 out of 4 of the new Tsums a total of 4 times; 3 of one and 1 of another, and they were the weakest of the bunch. This has happened to me more times than not; really tiring of this! I rarely get the paired or dual Tsums! Also the heart send receive dynamic stinks! The send one at a time is ridiculous! Why do we have the option to collect all at once, but not send all at once! Please do something to address this! Get tired of having to send one at a time while also having to tap again to confirm. It is a colossal waste of time! It also appears that most players I send hearts to either do not understand the dynamic or don’t have the courtesy to care about sending a heart back. Hope creators are listening! If so, thanks, if not, please do!</p>

      <p>With there being hundreds of tsums now, most of which require 36 copies to max out, pulling for them individually gets really really tedious and just seems like a massive waste of time. Almost every gacha game has a multi-pull system now, it’s really surprising to me that this one being so large doesn’t. I like this game, but it seems like the game doesn’t want you to actually play the game.</p>

      <p>Like most I’ve been playing this game for a while. And yes I do enjoy playing it and the characters are super cute! However, they don’t make things easy. Sending and receiving hearts manually takes time and also purchasing new Tsums! What a headache😩. Everything is manual and you can purchase more than one Tsum at a time! I have considered deleting this game more than once but I’ve invested so much of my time getting every Tsum that if I delete this now it would confirm all the time wasted on the game. Hope the developers find a way to make it easier for us who are busy but still want to play by allowing us to do multiple things on here... when that happens I will gladly come back and give this game better ratings!</p>

      <h4>Don’t waste real money., 2 stars (Irritable., Apple App Store, 2022-06-25)</h4>
      <p>Look it’s a good game.  I play it a lot, but the more I okay the more I realize there is an algorithm at work.  The odds to get new tsums aren’t boosted.  I don’t care what they say.  They just aren’t.  Currently we are in an event that is only playable with this months tsums and the only one I’ve managed to get is garbage and makes the event almost impossible.  It’s by design to get you to spend money to get coins to buy the boxes.  And 30k coins for a premium box is a LOT for how much you get per game.  You can get up to 1500 per day in missions.  But that’s it.  Typical Tsum Will average you 200-500 coins.  If you get a good one and get food with it you can get 1000-1300 a game.  But that’s still close to 30 games with 5 hearts that take 15 mins to replenish EACH.  And then when you start getting good with a Tsum…it just kind of stops falling.  I have one I can consistently break a thousand coins with and after farming her for a while she suddenly got horrible and wouldn’t fall.  Now I’m lucky to break 5-600.   I have another couple tsums I use for scoring.  If I use them too many times in a row they don’t fall right.  And the more I play consecutively (it I’ve stored up hearts) the worse ALL the tsums fall.  Make sure you don’t okay with the same one on repeat.  Mix them up.  And don’t waste your real money on this game.  Because it’s literally designed to make you do just that.</p>

      <h4>Waiting for the best update to make this 5 ⭐️, 4 stars (Rev runner, Apple App Store, 2022-05-27)</h4>
      <p>I have been playing this game since it first came out and I love it. The only gripe is have is what others have mentioned is the manual collection and giving of hearts. It’s the dumbest part of the game. I want to be playing not giving and receiving hearts on an hourly basis just to have coins and points. Way too tedious. I am almost at the point where I’m over playing this game bc of it. Keep in mind I’ve always been a manual sender/receiver for hearts. There are hacks to do it so it’s automatic but it’s a lot of work to set it up and it may have to be on another device that has to run all day like a laptop. 

Also, when u give/receive a heart there are multiple confirmation buttons to get thru. WHYYY?? We don’t need confirmation. If I press it once, do it, don’t ask to confirm if that’s what I want to do. And this has to be done for every single one. It’s hard if u have 100+ friends. I can spend almost 20 min/hour giving/receiving hearts. And that’s not even playing the game!!

There should also be an option to purchase more skill tickets and more ways to earn rubies than purchasing them</p>

      <p>I absolutely love this game! I have been playing it off and on for years, this is one of those games I download into every new phone I get!!! As much as I love this game there is one downside to it……. Unfortunately, sending hearts to friends (if you have 100 or more) can be a little tedious. Between having to tap each heart one by one you also have to confirm each heart being sent and tap past the confirmation of it being sent to tap the next heart to send. Only thing I ask for in this game to help make it better, is a better way to send hearts faster and easier so we’re not taking up a lot of time to send hearts to our friends every hour. Other then that I love this game and play for hours daily keep up the good work!</p>

Also I’ve seen a lot of good games that are starting to have their game be available offline too. Thank You for your hard work in designing such a cute, fun, sweet, adorable, and cool Disney game.</p>

      <h4>The only thing they need to fix.., 3 stars (MuraeR, Apple App Store, 2022-03-05)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded this game for my daughter 6 years ago when she was 7. The game has been great with just a few glitches here and there over the years. But now that she’s almost 14, we were trying to figure out why she can’t log into an account. For some reason, when Line made this game they didn’t also add some sort of counter that tells them the user is now old enough to be able to have an account login. So now if she wants to create and account she will have to uninstall the app and lose SIX YEARS of progress. There’s got to be some sort of fix for this that they could do. I can’t be the only one that sees this as a problem. I realize that in their terms and conditions it explains this, but 6 years of updates and that wasn’t one of them??</p>

      <p>I am addicted to this game, it’s so much fun! BUT.  It’s so annoying that they are constantly adding new tsums, and sometimes even putting them in the game you’re playing so it isn’t earning points or coins so then you have to keep buying boxes hoping to get that one. And good grief it’s expensive trying to level and skill up so many tsums! I have been playing for over three years and still don’t make over 2,000 points routinely, and that’s with my highest level tsum! Another thing is that if you decide to play, don’t play as a guest. I did and I still have to because if I want to now make it “official” I will lose all of my data. All of my tsums. All of my everything and be starting over from nothing.  I can see that eventually I will delete the game, sooner or later I will get tired of spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere, but I’m having fun now.</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing this game since it came out & became available for iOS at App Store. I really like the game. But I don’t like what I’m experiencing lately through it again. It sometimes crashes middle of the game. I can’t seem to send & ask for hearts from my friends anymore because it doesn’t show me they’re logged on when clearly I know they are as well. I even asked if they could send me a heart in the game but they couldn’t see me as logged in as well. I’ve tried to reset the WiFi & tried to redownload the app many times, but it didn’t help at all. I always make sure I have the latest IOS updated & this app is updated to the latest version too. Now I’m wondering why all of the sudden I’m having trouble logging into the game??? Please fix these problems As Soon As Posible it would be very much appreciative if you all are able to fix it asap. Thank you.

      <p>I think there’s lots of good things in this game but at the same time there are elements that I feel are not satisfying.  Every step of this game, you need to get an extra download.  What’s even more annoying is that regardless of the storage or speed of your phone, it takes a whole lot of time to download.  I downloaded about a 500 mb download and after taking about 5-10 minutes, it brought me immediately to a new screen in which there was about a 100 mb download.  The overall theme and quality of the game when in gameplay is great though!  However, if impatient or you want to quickly head into playing this game, I definitely would not recommend this.  But yeah, a solid 3-4 stars from me :D</p>

It’s very frustrating and I have to start all over again as a new user for all the tsum tsum games. I love this game and I spent a fortune on this game when it’s first came out. I just can’t stand the frustration with the new phone transfer and LINE kept asking you to verify your account. They even send verification code to the old device which it doesn’t make sense at all. I really don’t want to start this game all over again. So now I guess it’s time for me to let go of this game. Goodbye TsumTsum.</p>

      <p>Other than the two items below, the game is fun to play. I love the challenges, the bingo cards, and just playing to relax. I enjoy the three daily missions, but wish you didn’t need to play progressively more games to complete them.  First mission 3-4 games; second mission 7-8 games; third mission usually takes me 15 games. 

1) Lately, whatever TsumTsum I choose to play with will only have a half dozen in the play window - and they aren’t close enough together to link them. And, that’s playing with four characters instead of five. It can take 20 seconds (out of the sixty allotted per game) to get the TsumTsum close enough to link.

2) Lucky time boxes. I get so frustrated trying to get the new characters. I only try during “lucky time” when the odds of getting one of the new characters is “supposed” to be greater. Still, don’t get the new TsumTsum. When events can only be played with a new TsumTsum and you can’t get them, it is very frustrating. They have managed to program it so you don’t get TsumTsum that have maxed out; they ought to be able to program lucky time to give you TsumTsum you don’t have. I spent real $ to see if I could get a new TsumTsum during lucky time.  I spent it all trying to get a new TsumTsum - and didn’t get one new TsumTsum (or a TsumTsum I didn’t already have).</p>

      <h4>Good gameplay but bad RNG, 1 stars (Appledas, Apple App Store, 2021-07-30)</h4>
      <p>Game plays well...  but the most fun is collecting and playing all the new tsums.  Well, because of some sketchy RNG practices, you won’t be able to get all the tsums.  I’m not sure if that’s their way of trying to make you purchase things with real money, but something is afoul.

October 2020 event...
3 featured premium tsums.
Lucky time = 14% chance of getting one of them.
20 premium chance, 0 hits.
Odds of that happening is less than 5%... bad luck maybe?  Not likely since this happens ALL THE TIME!!!  (There were details of other months, but my previous review must have been removed)

December 2020....
3 premium tsums
Lucky time = 20%
25 premium boxed opened, 1 hit.... serious cheating here.

December 2020 (lucky time)
3 premium tsums
Lucky time = 15% chance for featured tsum
20 boxes opened, no hits.  (Less than 4% chance of that happening)

July 2021 (lucky time)
4 premium tsums 
Over 80 boxes opened, only got 2 of the featured tsums

Still going to be a 1 star rating until they are honest about this RNG.</p>

      <p>I haven’t touched this game since I upgraded my phone and this game and the larger screen do not mix well. It reminds me of the days when I would download games made for my itouch to my ipad. The quality just isn’t there.

For the larger screens, it’s super laggy and you just can’t make connections as easily anymore. I play a similar game (Pokémon Cafe) and it’s not laggy at all. Disappointed</p>

      <p>i spent time and money playing the game…to complete all sorts of task games. but it gets really tiring when u play more effective without using the bonus items, but not enough to complete the task. this would tempt me to use one of the bonus items esp. 5>4. but after countless tries playing while spending ur coins to using that item…u would think i would have more of the advantage, but NO! the system tricks u…they add less of your selected tsum and add more of other tsums which prevents u from completing the task, making u spend more money. UGH THE SUCH A CHEAT!!! of course, they give u that option to make the game more easier but for a price. Shame on all of u tsum tsum developers.  smh.</p>

      <p>This game is unlike many I’ve seen. The time limit to collect different TsumTsums, cute animations and fun cards keep this game fun. There is just enough to keep it interesting, but not confusing. I love playing this game. The only problems is a lot of times you get repeats of the tsums which is really annoying! Please fix this I know I’m not alone. It’s so frustrating to get the same repeat. 
Also a glitch that could be fixed . Sometimes the internet goes out or says I need to restart. When I get back in it has taken away my heart but says I still haven’t completed the tasks! Slightly annoying when you just completed a hard level.
If these two small problems were fixed, I’d give it 10 out of 5 stars!!!</p>

      <p>This is an ongoing frustration with this game. Last month I couldn’t play the bonus rounds at the end of the month because I didn’t get rewarded with the months new tsums.

I got one from April twice (it powered up) and finally got one from last month, but the rest were repeats.... out of 15 or more tsums! I’ve paid real money in the past and stopped when this started happening the first time. It’s unfortunate that they don’t reward loyal customers who have been playing the game for years.</p>

      <p>I loved this game at first.  They are cute and I enjoyed getting new Tsums since they have different abilities. After awhile, all you get is repeats. The lucky time is not lucky for me and I see other reviewers have also noticed. So it’s not just me. 
They used to rotate the premium box’s, but now there are 98 in there!  During lucky time you usually have a 2-6% chance of getting a “lucky” one, yet you will probably get one of the other 90+.  Because you can keep getting the same ones over and over again and they get stronger. To get from a skill of 4 to 5 you will need about 10 of that character and to get from 5 to 6 you will need about 20 of that character.  Since it costs 30,000 coins to buy a box, you can see how long it will take you.   I am losing interest in this game because of this 

They could make this game so much better by actually making the lucky time lucky.  Also, rotate the characters in the premium boxes like they used to, so you actually have a small chance of getting  one you want.  Finally please bring back the characters that have never been back since we haven’t all be playing this game since it started and some characters have never come back.</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing Tsum Tsum for years, and it’s very addictive. Once I start playing I find that I can’t put it down until I’m too tired to play because you keep wanting to earn enough coins to buy one more box, then another, and another. It’s always exciting to get a new Tsum you don’t have, but it’s extra thrilling to get a Tsum you keep hoping to get in order to skill up your favorite(s). 

One feature I’m hoping can be added to the game is the ability to choose to have skills automatically activate as soon as the meter is filled without having to tap the skills button on the lower left. I understand that you may not always want skills to activate immediately, and that some people may want to control when skills are activated at all times.  So it would be great if we can have an “auto activate skills” button in the settings that we can turn on or off, similar to how gyro can be turned on or off.

Thank you to LINE for adding a +Combo to items! I’m able to achieve 90/100+ combos when I’m not trying but when it’s required for a mission I sometimes mess up under pressure. So this addition really helps.

My most recent try the game glitched, took 30,000 coins and didn’t even give me a box to open. 😬The other thing that gripes me is when you move to a new level and earn a 5 heart reward. If you happen to have any hearts at the time it doesn’t bank your reward but just limits it to 5 total. The game knows how to store more than 5 hearts, so why cheat players on their earned reward?</p>

      <h4>Lovely game, but it is exhausting., 1 stars (tttttfxashjfsc, Apple App Store, 2021-02-19)</h4>
      <p>Many people would agree that they play this game for collecting Tsum-Tsums.

But since I’ve been playing this game for four years, I had to address few problems

1. It is really hard to get tsum-tsum: It is too pricy. It is almost impossible to open one box unless you spend long time. I would recommend reducing its amount to reasonable coin spending. 

2. Even we are able to open the box, we get the same tsum-tsum?: After spending LONG LONG time to get one box, there is high chance for you to get the same tsum-tsum to “raise it's skills”. Which was frustrating, since you need to get MANY of them to reach it’s full skills. (when the people wants new tsum tsum.) I recommend selling tickets separately only for raising skills and separate the box just for getting new characters. 

Please consider making big changes before you lose its fans...</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing the game for years and it was a little concerning when they started adding ads you could view for rewards. I was thankful they were optional. But then soon after the drop rates on new and event specific Tsums went into the toilet. Seems every box you buy nowadays is a repeat of a Tsum you already have even during “Happy Time”. Then they started doing shady things like requiring certain new Tsums for events as well as events that require objectives that are absurdly difficult to complete. All aimed at pushing players to buy rubies with real money. It’s sad to see how bad the game has gotten and honestly if it wasn’t for my wife still playing I would’ve quit by now.</p>

      <p>Folks, this “lucky time” is truly a joke. For the December “tsum” I bought so many boxes during lucky time and finally gave up. Then went in and got one several days later not in lucky time.  So frustrating!  For this month’s tsum I’ve bought 5 boxes thus far in their so called lucky time and have not gotten one.  My sister also plays and she bought ten boxes during lucky time and never got one.  This is the most reticulum thing. Either actually make it lucky time or stop saying it is so you don’t get our hopes up.</p>

I just decided to give it a try again.  This time I only bought 5 premium boxes and again not 1 new Tsum Tsum.  So I am done with this game.</p>

      <p>Played Tsum for hundreds of hours over the course of 4+ years loved it so much I was willing to spend lots of $$ to play on and on until I got a new iPhone which caused me to lose everything!  Lost over 300,000 coins, 30 red premium tickets, 30 level tickets, 6 skill tickets and lots and lots of tickets like the 5>4 and others collected while playing the decorate the room event not to mention over 900 rubies that were purchased just a week earlier!
As a player I was unaware that LINE would just dump you when you get a new phone, it is impossible to “verify” your account when your “previous device” is no longer in your possession. Just plain dumb for spending so much time and money, I felt so cheated to deleted this app.</p>

After this updated, it’s stuck at “Retrieving Data....” I tried reloaded the app. Nothing works! This is annoying and frustrating!!

      <p>This app has been glitching for several months now. Lots of us have spent real money on this and our concerns aren’t being heard. Every single time I log in it makes me download 375 mb of data. It takes 5-10 minutes and happens all day. This has made the game unplayable for me. So if they’re not going to fix it, id like all my money back since the game can’t be played unless you wait the entire time every single time you log in. It’s ridiculous. Don’t waste your time or money on this game until they actually care if it gets fixed.</p>

      <p>I have been playing for years now. I love all the additional new characters, game cards, events, etc. The issue I have is that every time you do a sticker book or have new characters for them or a special even they are nearly impossible to get. I have been using all my coins and premium tickets to try and get one of the 3 newest brave Tsums since they came out and all I get are repeats. It would be nice if they changed up the algorithm a little bit for those “Lucy Times”</p>

Then you spend 30k coins to get a new tsum and end up with one you already have and the skill up is super low too even when the tsums skill is still small. If you’re going to make it that hard you should lower the cost of the box. Super frustrating.</p>

      <p>I have been playing this game for so long, and I often quit and come back to see anything different.  Eventually is still the same.  If you want your game to be good and popular then there are a few tithing need to change.   Getting a new character is super hard and you keep on getting junky repeated character.  If the developers can make that we can select a character to buy but to get the character we want either increase the cost or after 10 straight buy it a guaranteed.  This repeated buy the same junky character is bad idea.   Secondly it so hard to get coin and life in this game especially you have no friend to send you life and coin reward is so ridiculous low.   Not everyone is capable of playing good to gain thousands of coin every time.   Because it so hard to get new character the coin reward should be reward 10 time more.</p>

Can someone please fix this issue because I am not the only one having this problem my friend seems to have had the same problem occurring with her iPad as well. Also I find it a waste in regards to the new characters. It doesn’t matter how many boxes you buy you get the same old characters over and over you need to do something because that lucky time is also a rip off I can buy six boxes and get six of the same characters I’ve had before so I’m not sure what your definition of lucky actually is.</p>

      <h4>Fun addictive time waster, 2 stars (Ghost fare, Apple App Store, 2020-08-30)</h4>
      <p>Update. Down to one star now. I cannot play this game causally. It seems every time I wish to play a quick game there is an update to be loaded. And those updates are 330MB! And they will not load in the background for some odd reason, and they load pitifully slow. 

At least this game is not ad-infested like every other game I try to download and play. I do give them credit there. Lately it seems that most games are half ad, half play or offer ad-free for about $100 a year. 

Update. Loss of rating star because the game will only play if I have a cell phone data connection on my iPad and have turned off my (working) wifi connection to ComCast. It is the only app that has this problem. 

Tsum Tsum is a very simple game. It is mindless and fun to play. It is also very addictive. You will constantly run out  of 'hearts'. You can find a group on LINE to exchange hearts with. 

My only complaints about the game are that it is on line only, and advancement is very slow. There are currently 52 tsums available. You need about 15 of each tsum to reach the upper levels. It takes (me) about three hours of aggressive play to earn a single tsum. And they add new tsums every month or so. You are potently looking at several thousand hours of gameplay to max things out. Of course, you could always just buy the tsums for cash.</p>

      <h4>What happened!?, 3 stars (SallyMater, Apple App Store, 2020-08-27)</h4>
      <p>While I like this game a lot and have played it for six years, I am always disappointed that when there are special or limited time only tsums in the premium box, more often than not I just get a skill level raise to a tsum I already have (and it's usually one of the lamer ones that I don't use often). I think when offering limited time only tsums, you should usually get one of those when you buy a box!   I have recently opened about 10 premium boxes over the Lion King campaign and have yet to get one of the TsumTsums that would actually help me get bonus points!  The game ends today and i really could have used bonus points to play some of those cards.  Please quit being so stingy with the limited time TsumTsums!</p>

      <p>I have been plying this game for years and it scams you. For two weeks I have been stuck on a game where you had to get exactly 350 coins with a black tsum I played with max and have been trying this certain card for weeks. I finally just got 350 exactly and they didn’t take it. It didn’t update so I have to keep trying. I will not spend another dime on this game.</p>

There was a point where the game would make you re-download every time you opened it, so I stopped playing the game for a while since it was annoying. When I came back to start up again, it lost all of my progress and characters.

      <h4>Ups and Downs.., 4 stars (@siidneyt, Apple App Store, 2020-06-01)</h4>
      <p>This game is very fun and adorable!!! I would play it way more, if it didn’t keep crashing each round is done. Also, the graphics seem to be a bit blurry, so maybe that can also be fixed. Overall a great game, but please fix the crashing bugs!!!</p>

      <h4>Current version is buggy, 1 stars (FrustratedFurious, Apple App Store, 2020-05-22)</h4>
      <p>Update: The issue has only gotten worse.  I have had THREE hearts stolen after the game hangs then crashes so far TODAY, and I have barely played.  This is becoming untenable.  I really enjoy this game, except for how little playtime you get if you don’t pay, but not anymore!  If they can fix it I’m going to need to delete it and move on.  My precious downtime is more valuable than this.

I really like this game overall.  The characters are cute.  I think the cards are fun.  But the current version is SO buggy.  It crashes 5-6 times every time I play.  And in the past few days. It has been stealing lives when it crashes!  The biggest drawback of the game is the long recharge time for lives (15 minutes) versus the play time, which 60 seconds per.  So just as you’re building up to being fast enough to possibly complete the challenge, you’re out of lives and have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to get another five minutes of play time.  And when it crashes and steals one, it adds insult to injury.  Extremely frustrating.  I absolutely refuse to spend real money to play, and if my free lives are being stolen, I can only imagine how upsetting it would be to have one I paid for stolen.  I hope they address this issue soon.</p>

      <p>It's fun , yes but if you try to buy more tsums, it gives you the tsum that you already have, so you're just basically wasting your 30,000 coins. So for me, it's a rip off and it's frustrating!</p>

      <h4>Great, 5 stars (giraffegirljoely2019Apple App Store, 2020-05-19)</h4>
      <p>This is such a great game.  You continue to add events and give lots of time to play them.  The only tiny thing is that you might want to change it to unless you don't complete the goal that is when you loose a heart. But if you complete the challenge (from the event because there is almost always an event going on) then you don't loose a heart.  But that is entirely a personal preference. But I 150% recommend this.  It is so fun to feel the suspense when you are about to get a new character.  I have played this for so long.   My mother doesn't play games on her phone, but she did download this.  I have never gone back.   Download this if you are looking for a pass time in the car of just because you are bored of old games.  I can promise you will not get bored of this game.</p>

      <p>A really fun game to play with my kids but really frustrating since getting new tsums is all based on chance. Can’t tell you how many boxes we’ve bought, only to get the same tsums over and over and over again. And don’t be fooled by the so called “lucky time” - that’s a complete load of crap. Really wish they put coin values on tsums and let you shop for them- then you could get ones you need for challenges or the ones you want.</p>

      <p>The gameplay is fine but it relies too much on network for all the trivial things like scoring. And very often due to lost network connection a whole game progress is lost along with all the bonus items I bought. At least is should be able to cache those progress and upload once network is ok. This is like FRAUD.</p>
