        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment about Dolly (Product)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Dolly has been great for me every time I've used it. Just be accurate with your estimations and tip at the end. All the movers I've had were super helpful and hard working." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/emf9hmq/">(Travelswithcat, Reddit, 2019-05-03)</a></li>
<li>"I've used Dolly 3 times.. I hired a guy and their truck twice and then just hired a guy to help move some furniture. It's great. All three times my expectations were totally exceeded. Loved it and recommend it to friends who are moving." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/emgbz5t/">(NotTheFakeJeff, Reddit, 2019-05-04)</a></li>
<li>"I had a good experience, but I was also a little desperate and needed someone quick. I wouldn't use them for big jobs. Craigslist movers are better." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/f44i4js/">(littleMissMuffet1234, Reddit, 2019-10-17)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment about Dolly (Product)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"No, never use Dolly. I had a terrible experience with them. The movers are not professional and scratched up my floors. Dolly will not cover any environmental damage (food, walls, etc). The damage costs more than the items they moved. It is not worth the risk, hire professional movers and not the people on Dolly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/kf0p155/">(dongit, Reddit, 2023-12-26)</a></li>
<li>"Tried using Dolly two years ago and got massively screwed. Had movers 'accept' my move two weeks before it was scheduled to happen, but I never got information on the movers via the app. I started getting nervous and started contacting Dolly support the week before the move. I was assured that movers would be there on moving day. After continuing to contact support asking for more details, my support request was elevated and I was finally told, 48 hours before my move, that I actually didn't have a mover scheduled." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ht7agp0/">(mtf612, Reddit, 2022-01-18)</a></li>
<li>"AVOID AVOID AVOID. My pickup had a window of 2-2:30 PM. My Dolly mover cancelled at 2:35 PM and Dolly just messaged me 'Your Dolly Helper has notified us that they're unable to do your Dolly. Our apologies! We're working hard to find a new Helper.' But this is New York City." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ktta6o8/">(Obvious_Care8028, Reddit, 2024-03-07)</a></li>
<li>"I have used it twice when I moved. The first time…it went completely fine. The second time, however, it was the exact opposite. I had movers assigned like two weeks before, and they canceled at 7 AM the day of my move!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1f2v5xr/experience_with_using_dolly_app_for_moving/lk9kr32/">(appw23, Reddit, 2024-08-28)</a></li>
<li>"Dolly was so awesome when it first came out and was fully functional. I think some regulations on movers cut much of its usefulness here." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/19dd1un/alternatives_to_dolly_app/kj524t9/">(drshort, Reddit, 2024-01-23)</a></li>

<h2>General Sentiment about Dolly (Company)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"It's illegal for them to deduct your pay or make you pay for shit like that." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lckp8yg/">(Monsterrawrrrr, Reddit, 2024-07-10)</a></li>
<li>"Your DSP cannot take it out of your check because it's federally prohibited and they would get in big trouble if they did." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lby598j/">(lby598j, Reddit, 2024-07-06)</a></li>
<li>"Equipment loss is the cost of doing business." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbwq5cy/">(lbwq5cy, Reddit, 2024-07-06)</a></li>
<li>"They can’t deduct it from your paycheck because they are not allowed to force you to pay for it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbwih9n/">(lbwih9n, Reddit, 2024-07-06)</a></li>
<li>"The fact your dsp might’ve even said okay to that is a huge red flag!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbx9uhb/">(lbx9uhb, Reddit, 2024-07-06)</a></li>
<li>"I’d just recommend going to the apartment complex and asking if they have it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonDSPDrivers/comments/1dw920i/i_left_a_dolly_at_an_apartment_complex/lbumbux/">(lbumbux, Reddit, 2024-07-06)</a></li>

<li>"This isn’t even a satisfying picture of one. You can usually stack two hardcovers - one with the spine like it is here and another with the spike facing out." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0efx0/">(None, Reddit, 2022-09-04)</a></li>
<li>"I used to work at Barnes and Noble for years. Every Monday night after close, we would ever out several of these to put out the new releases for Tuesday morning opening when the new books of the week are released. Very useful dolly (except when the book you need is on the very bottom of the stack 😅)" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0ax4c/">(grizzlyblake91, Reddit, 2022-09-04)</a></li>

I bet the one pictured wouldn't handle the typical shop floor that most of the tank carts are used in." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/specializedtools/comments/x580vr/this_dolly_specifically_for_books/in0gzx4/">(Scullvine, Reddit, 2022-09-04)</a>]</li>
