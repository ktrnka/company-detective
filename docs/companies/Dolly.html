        <h2>Negative Sentiment Towards Dolly</h2>
<h3>Last Minute Cancellations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I read app store reviews and a lot of people seemed to have last minute cancelation by the helpers which would be a nightmare on a move day." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/">(sjung098, Reddit, 2022-01-18)</a></li>
<li>"AVOID AVOID AVOID. My pickup had a window of 2-2:30 PM. My Dolly mover cancelled at 2:35 PM and Dolly just messaged me 'Your Dolly Helper has notified us that they're unable to do your Dolly. Our apologies!'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ktta6o8/">(Obvious_Care8028, Reddit, 2024-03-07)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Poor Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Tried using Dolly two years ago and got massively screwed. Had movers 'accept' my move two weeks before it was scheduled to happen, but I never got information on the movers via the app." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ht7agp0/">(mtf612, Reddit, 2022-01-18)</a></li>
<li>"I was then stuck finding movers two days before my move. Fuck Dolly. Never ever again." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ht7agp0/">(mtf612, Reddit, 2022-01-18)</a></li>
<li>"Never never never use these scammers. Hired and paid for a closeby move. The mover picked up the load and refused to drop off at our apartment." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/s71qsp/dolly_app_for_nyc_local_move/ljaoet7/">(panalohgfd, Reddit, 2024-08-21)</a></li>
<li>"I had a terrible experience with them. The movers are not professional and scratched up my floors. Dolly will not cover any environmental damage (food, walls, etc). The damage costs more than the items they moved. It is not worth the risk, hire professional movers and not the people on Dolly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/bkagrh/is_dolly_a_good_app_for_moving_an_entire_bedroom/kf0p155/">(dongit, Reddit, 2023-12-26)</a></li>

Every Monday night after close, we would ever out several of these to put out the new releases for Tuesday morning opening when the new books of the week are released.
