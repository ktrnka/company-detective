      <p>Do not use this company or app, they are liars & are complicity participating in fraudulent activity. You use the automated system online to book your move, then they cancel your booking and claim you need to pay more because the website is wrong. Meanwhile, their website says "upfront, guaranteed pricing" verbatim. They're refusal to cooperate or remedy their fraud is blatant, even after the agent admitted the fraudulent activity on our call. Do not ever use Dolly. Period.</p>

Shows up with dad for the 2 hour assignment because his dad needs him. only has an hour and has to leave with dad after an hour. Dad will help. Weird.

      <p>Terrible experience. I needed movers on demands between 2-4pm and revolved our entire moving schedule around it. At 2:15pm when nobody showed, I messaged and was told they weren't coming til 3:30. The uhaul truck, full of our belongings, was due back at 5pm. I never received notice or confirmation from the app either way. When they did arrive, they were not big, strong, fast or sharp. I had to micro manage them the entire 2 hours. The whole experience was very frustrating and I feel ripped off!!</p>

I put in 10am on the website, however the app sent the helpers at 9am. 10am is when the store opens for pickup. They canceled because of this flaw, because they couldn't wait. Support says it's a "glitch". I rescheduled TWO times, with no helper assigned either times, this was DAYS without any assignment of helpers, for each reschedule. Wasted TIME!

      <p>Have had multiple experiences now where movers cancel at the last minute, no explanation, no opportunity to leave a review or hear what happened. This app clearly doesn't manage its movers well in ways that encourage them to follow through. It's very disruptive when you're planning to move something for movers to cancel at the last minute.</p>

      <p>Very disappointed as I really used to like working for Dolly up until recently. The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. 

The support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. 

They used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!

What really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work. Instead they take advantage and exploit hard working honest people on the daily.</p>

I have a 2008 Yukon Denali with a 7 x 16 enclosed cargo trailer. This is how Dolly response once I contact customer support.
. Helper,

Thank you for reaching out about an open Dolly. We rely on our app to match available helpers to the open Dollys in each market and no longer manually assign Helpers to Dollys upon request.

If you are consistently experiencing issue being assigned to open Dolly's your preferences may be contradicting the Dollys you are requesting. Our system determines eligibility of each Helper based on all their preferences: Day of the week, timing, and Hands/Assistant preferences. Updating your preferences to remove any specifics that no longer apply will improve your eligibility and help reduce any issues you may be experiencing.

If you have an issue separate from the one described above please respond detailing the issue you are experiencing and we'd be happy to help. Keep in mind I have a helper I have more than enough space in my enclosed cargo trailer. Can someone please tell me what the requirements are to make deliveries or be assigned deliveries from Rove Concepts?</p>

They don’t care about the workers, as far as clients go, they charge you one price that makes you think you’re paying top dollar for service, but the workers receive less than half and half to pay a helper as well as gas. They don’t accommodate for stairs. Dolly is HORRIBLE.</p>

      <p>They work you like slaves. Their customer service is based on the Middle East. They all have heavy accent. They don’t know how expensive is to live in the United States. All their gigs jobs are low pay. They think that an extra $20 is a lot to us. You can not ask for more pay when the job is more work. Customers can literally put whatever they want on the job description so it can be less money. Customers and the app take advantage of this platform. Instead of paying us the same or more for a job, they pay us less. I worked for them for over 3 years. I was one of their best drivers. I had nothing but 5 stars rating and reviews and they deactivated my account like nothing.</p>

They might have preference but at the end it doesn’t matter if you get requested for the job as they will give it to someone else so i don't get the point of being requested and not getting the job. Its not worth it gas prices are too high and they just give you the small jobs even if you get requested doesnt mean-you’ll   get the job so its useless to get requested.</p>

      <h4>Set for the benefit of the company not the helpers, 2 stars (jdh1994., Apple App Store, 2022-10-13)</h4>
      <p>This is another app primarily set up to protect the company itself and it’s interests rather than doing right by the helpers. Also BEWARE THE TEAMS SCAM. When you have someone (like a spouse) who can work with you, they’ll tell you to setup as a team rather than an individual helper and hands. When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company. Those savings are not passed on to the customer. 

Beyond this, job descriptions and sizes are often inaccurate. Support claims quick response times but average 3-24hrs. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.</p>

Most of the other people I’ve been assigned to work with (other “Hands”) have been perfectly find. Today (9/6/22), the individual i was scheduled with decided to threaten me when i started suggesting better ways to move the customers belongings because things were getting damaged. The customer even asked for more care to be taken. When I contacted Dolly support (something they make close to impossible to do) they simply said they’d make a note of it and I wont be scheduled with him anymore. I left immediately sacrificing pay as the support agent wasn't helping.

If you have a vehicle and drive, after you pay your expenses you will definitely end up working for less than the minimum wage. You are “own contractor “ but in the same time you have no rights or options to negotiate anything with the customers. Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will. If you do that, why don’t you just give it to the person you want. That’s why the moving companies have dispatch.</p>

      <p>The dispatchers on here are mostly all right, however, it is a normal to expect that little things will not be resolved in the Helper’s favor, just like in any other delivery company, from food and taxi to loads and freight, the driver is scum, dirt and filth and they do let you know that when there is a need.  The way they let you know is in tiny things, small change, scheduling and in a hundred other ways that is always taken out of your pocket.  For example, the algorithm will not let you take other jobs in the same directions so you could make up those tolls and gas,  it would rather give this miserly job pay to another sucker that didn’t want to be an office rat, or they would judge in their favor when the dump fees are involved,  stating one thing on the job detail and then stiffing you like a petty thief after you paid those fees out of pocket, all in a fairly good office language, polite, exact and rotten as their job descriptions are.   
If you complain of low earnings, being stiffed by them for dump fees, etc., this is when the true nature of this business comes out - your payout is lowered and there is nothing you can do about it.  Almost nothing.  However, for swine that resorts to power play when caught red-handed, almost nothing doesn’t penetrate their thick skin…
Always remember to acquire your own clients, this is a minimum wage type of a gig,  doesn’t matter what it looks like upfront.</p>

      <p>You’ll never get jobs. I bid on at least 2 a day and I haven’t had a job in a month. 

Also had a job where my partner didn’t show up, so I reported it to dolly hoping to get more pay since I did all the work for 2 people, but they ended up taking money away from me.</p>

      <h4>Their customer service reps are incompetent, 2 stars (teeko253, Apple App Store, 2023-12-01)</h4>
      <p>They are all over the place with what they say, none of them are on the same accord. And they speak EXTREMELY fast with heavy Indian accents it’s so hard to understand them. They listed a dolly through the Instawork app, I took it, but then changed my mind and deleted my Instawork account. Well since I’m already signed up with dolly they still penalized me for it through the dolly app when the Instawork app mentioned nothing about it being for dolly. And even in the Dolly app it says I have one last minute cancel from November yet they still claim I have 2 in the last 90 days when the app/my profile clearly states one. I showed them all the proof, they still refuse to try to find a resolution. Every rep I’ve talked to is extremely condescending, rude, unprofessional, and hard to explain. But then again being in a 3rd world country I don’t expect them to care about delivering quality service when what they charged me for cancelling last minute is probably what they make in a day</p>

      <h4>App needs a rewrite, 2 stars (MissChargers619, Apple App Store, 2023-12-19)</h4>
      <p>Whenever I get a notification of a job most times if the job is significant in value it tells me it’s been taken before I can even review it. What happened to the countdown? Even when I go to review it right away, same thing. How are the $100+ jobs always gone immediately, (bots?). Also, in the past if I had waited say 5 seconds before reviewing a job it meant my count down clock wouldn’t start for seconds which wouldn’t allow me to accept a job until 5 seconds later than anyone who had started reviewing it before me. Why not just start everyone’s clock at the same time? Finally, as a driver you are always asking me to give up a portion of my potential earnings to secure helpers, seems to me you should rework your business model.</p>

      <h4>Less than minimum wage, 1 stars (Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)</h4>
      <p>Just finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.</p>

      <p>I’ve been working with dolly for almost 2 years it’s pretty plain and simple pick up the item take it from point A to point B Dollys pretty fair when it comes to pricing the jobs and when I need help the support is pretty on top of it I’ve yet to have a problem with this company I personally love it unlike some other unmentionable apps that  may or may not rhyme with slug I’m happy to work with Dolly in the future I’d hope to see this company push more for contracts with furniture stores ect. It might even help to send some drivers flyers to get the word out a lot of people don’t know about this if you wanted to make it a rewards system for the contractors you could put barcodes on the flyers so you keep tally of who’s braught in the most customers threw personally advertising it seems like a win win</p>

      <p>Get your pay taken for small scratches and dealing with the worst customers. Support always sides with customers and will suspend your account.

They’ll say it’s just a table but it’s a full dining set and etc.</p>

      <p>They low ball you the pay out is half so if the job is 20$ you plus the person you work with get 40$ altogether and Dolly collects 40$. They don’t demand for the customers to post picture so you don’t get accurately paid for the job your doing. And making adjustments with the customer gets complicated sometimes.</p>
