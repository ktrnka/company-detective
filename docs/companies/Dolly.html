      <p>Dolly personalized abuse, evil, stress and crooked company control. I worked here for a while. You have no control, they set the rates and a lottery decides who gets jobs, also some jobs pay below CA min eage. Most jobs are already assigned before you even get the notification. When you request some jobs, they don't assign uou. To they also spy & block from talking too customers, giving your phone, and will deactivate you. These company trash. All negative reviews are true.</p>

I get an offer for a $43 job that is 55 miles away then will have to drive 45 miles back? This app is the fastest way to go broke I have ever seen. If you were truly your own business then you could also set your own rates. The only person making money by way of this app is the company doing background checks. Horrible app.</p>

      <p>They give you minimal information about jobs. The clients rarely answer messages when asking specific questions. By the time you do get details, it's usually too late to cancel the trip, and if you do cancel within a 24-hour window, they charge YOU $20. I have taken jobs based on information they provide and have found myself in very unsafe situations based on the details they left out of the order request. I suggest picking another app and using them ..</p>

      <p>Application seems to be okay, the only thing that I don't agree with is the fact that if you need two people to do 1 job they can assign you with another helper however you have to split the cost with them 50/50 which isn't really fair especially if you're the one who's hauling the items in your truck and having to pay for the fuel yourself. So in essence you're actually getting paid less than the helper. That is totally not fair.</p>

There are not many jobs that are coming in and when they do they go really fast. So unless you stay on the app all day long your chances of getting any work are slim to none. When you do get a job you're basically making $10 an hour or less after your account for travel time time spent the app looking and all the other stuff</p>

      <p>Seems like an OK app. I tend to receive a small handful of jobs daily. They tend to range generally from $40-$100. The thing is though, they usually always come in say 30 minutes before the job start time, and I may be that far or farther away, or it's not even worth the pay for the total time of driving there, to the drop off, then back home. I love moving type work, but this doesn't seem to suffice for me.</p>

Insanely low payout for the amount of gas you need. Gonna split a five a piece between you and your helper by the time your finished. Lol THIS IS NOT A $40-45 HOUR PLACE!

      <p>This is one of many places that I source jobs for my Hauling & Junk Removal business. It's also the least useful and lowest outputting source, mainly because of Dolly's "request job" feature when jobs come in. You can't just pickup jobs, you have to request them when they come in, and the last 10-12 jobs ive requested have been given to someone else. Been using this app for a few weeks and I've only been able to get 2 jobs. Really poor algorithm or manual review process for assinging jobs</p>

      <p>I'm done with this app. The pay out is so low, it's not even worth it. I got stuck doing a "quick" job for 8 hours straight for $161 today. Dolly doesn't care about the worker. Most jobs you'll find are between $18 to $35 for 1 hr of work. You can really only get one job, 2 if you're lucky, per day. It's sometimes pretty difficult to calculate what the load will be also, due to a lack of details. Tip, avoid appliances, couches, and stairs, it's not worth it.</p>

      <p>Their rates for helpers are so low. Most jobs are $60. Plus gas plus tolls you end upaling like 30 on 70 miles. Very few jobs are okay.. pick up options are killing the rates customers always go for that and if I have a van I get pay as a pick up which means like $30 less.</p>

As the months have gone by, there have been fewer Dollys available or we would be "outbid" every time. That never made sense since we couldn't "bid", they were set prices. Then in Oct, the helper pay was cut in HALF! When I contacted support, they told me they couldn't tell me why the pay decreased and if I didn't like it, don't take the Dolly job. Wow.

      <p>They let you feel good about the job when you first start. They give you a lot of jobs the first two months then after that you start getting one job per week. They also say that you get 100% of your tips but you don’t. We asked a customer how much tip he gave and he said $40 but Dolly gave us $36 and they do this every time. Not a good app they just care about making all the money for themselves. The reason a lot of people use Dolly is because their cheap and the reason their cheap is because they don’t look out for their drivers and pay them next to nothing. Don’t care where the job is or how the traffic is THEY JUST WANT THE MONEY!!!!
Trust me if you’re looking to get in to the delivery and moving business don’t use this app it’s a rip off. Speaking from experience.</p>

      <h4>Pay/ job acceptance used to be higher, 1 stars (The*Honest*Truth, Apple App Store, 2023-06-07)</h4>
      <p>I was once working for Dolly for 3-4 years (on and off). In my early stages with this company, I was actually making $500-$700 a week (as a hand). 2-3 years later, I got a truck and became a helper. Becoming a helper means more money a week. Normally, doubling whatever a hands would make a week. In my case, suppose to be $1000-$1,400 a week! Once I became a helper, it was hard getting accepted for jobs. They pay started to slowly drop overtime. Then, out of nowhere, Dolly just became cheap. This caused me to cancel or not show up to certain jobs. Really have to think long and hard about doing the job before/ after accepting it. I truly don’t know what happened to Dolly. I was one of the first people to sign up and work with Dolly. It was like a gold mine in its early stages. Now, they’re slowly putting themselves out of business!</p>

It might even help to send some drivers flyers to get the word out a lot of people don’t know about this if you wanted to make it a rewards system for the contractors you could put barcodes on the flyers so you keep tally of who’s braught in the most customers threw personally advertising it seems like a win win</p>

      <p>Every post seems to be false advertising with a higher payment amount to get helpers interested. If you are not willing to split, don’t ever expect to be selected for a job. I’ve requested 13 dollys declining splitting, but have received zero. Almost every one has told me that there was an under supply of hands, so I would have to accept a lower split rate if I was still interested. They should just post the lower rates initially since the application seems rigged to never give anyone the higher payout.</p>

      <h4>Less than minimum wage, 1 stars (Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)</h4>
      <p>Just finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.</p>

Whoever prices these jobs needs to get properly trained or fire them and get someone else who understands long term business growth. You are not gonna survive long term by being cheap and low balling your helpers when they are the ones who make your business possible. They are the blood of your business. Without them, you die. This company needs to learn to adapt to market conditions and understand that gas is near $6 gallon (higher in some places). Nobody in their right minds is gonna move a fridge for $20. It’s a smack in the face to the workers. You will be better off Starting your own moving company instead of working for Dolly. They can’t seem to keep their hands off your hard worked money.</p>

Well since I’m already signed up with dolly they still penalized me for it through the dolly app when the Instawork app mentioned nothing about it being for dolly. And even in the Dolly app it says I have one last minute cancel from November yet they still claim I have 2 in the last 90 days when the app/my profile clearly states one. I showed them all the proof, they still refuse to try to find a resolution. Every rep I’ve talked to is extremely condescending, rude, unprofessional, and hard to explain.

      <p>The first couple of dollys you will get will be a fair pay, after that it’s the bottom dollar amount. Living in Los Angeles and knowing the market I’m surprised people actually take those opportunities. Another disadvantage is that you cannot pickup two different orders from one location such as IKEA, and that would make more sense simply because they pay about $50 per dolly from IKEA.
The app is crazy laggy all the time. Needs to be updated, it feels like I’m using Internet explorer or something…</p>

      <p>Whenever I get a notification of a job most times if the job is significant in value it tells me it’s been taken before I can even review it. What happened to the countdown? Even when I go to review it right away, same thing. How are the $100+ jobs always gone immediately, (bots?). Also, in the past if I had waited say 5 seconds before reviewing a job it meant my count down clock wouldn’t start for seconds which wouldn’t allow me to accept a job until 5 seconds later than anyone who had started reviewing it before me. Why not just start everyone’s clock at the same time? Finally, as a driver you are always asking me to give up a portion of my potential earnings to secure helpers, seems to me you should rework your business model.</p>

Most of the other people I’ve been assigned to work with (other “Hands”) have been perfectly find. Today (9/6/22), the individual i was scheduled with decided to threaten me when i started suggesting better ways to move the customers belongings because things were getting damaged. The customer even asked for more care to be taken. When I contacted Dolly support (something they make close to impossible to do) they simply said they’d make a note of it and I wont be scheduled with him anymore. I left immediately sacrificing pay as the support agent wasn't helping. 

Use this app at your own risk, no one will help you if you are in danger.</p>

      <p>I have the app for more than 6 months and haven’t did a single job. The price what they giving is a total joke. If you have a vehicle and drive, after you pay your expenses you will definitely end up working for less than the minimum wage. You are “own contractor “ but in the same time you have no rights or options to negotiate anything with the customers. Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will. If you do that, why don’t you just give it to the person you want. That’s why the moving companies have dispatch.</p>

      <h4>Set for the benefit of the company not the helpers, 2 stars (jdh1994., Apple App Store, 2022-10-13)</h4>
      <p>This is another app primarily set up to protect the company itself and it’s interests rather than doing right by the helpers. Also BEWARE THE TEAMS SCAM. When you have someone (like a spouse) who can work with you, they’ll tell you to setup as a team rather than an individual helper and hands. When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company. Those savings are not passed on to the customer. 

Beyond this, job descriptions and sizes are often inaccurate. Support claims quick response times but average 3-24hrs. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.</p>

      <p>In order for you to make money you have to At least do 3-4 jobs just to fill up gas tank. They only give you the small jobs most of the time which is like 15-20 dollars its rare when they give you 30-80. I been getting requested by drivers to do the big moves 100+ but they never give the big moves only the least payed ones. They might have preference but at the end it doesn’t matter if you get requested for the job as they will give it to someone else so i don't get the point of being requested and not getting the job. Its not worth it gas prices are too high and they just give you the small jobs even if you get requested doesnt mean-you’ll   get the job so its useless to get requested.</p>
