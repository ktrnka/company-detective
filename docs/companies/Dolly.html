      <h4>SCAM SCAM SCAM, 1 stars (Leonardd08, Apple App Store, 2022-07-30)</h4>
      <p>It’s a big scam.

Less than minimum wage after everything. Doesn’t pay extra to be the one with a truck. The app constantly tries to get you to split 50/50 for jobs that will cost you more in gas than you will get paid. $20 job but your mileage will be over 100 miles round trip?? Do the math.

Putting your body, asset (vehicle), and time on the line isn’t worth it. You will never break even on this app after the cost of gas - don’t even bother. The math just doesn’t add up. 

Oh yeah and there’s $25 entry fee.</p>

      <h4>DONT USE THIS APP, 1 stars (nickxxx15, Apple App Store, 2024-01-11)</h4>
      <p>They let you feel good about the job when you first start. They give you a lot of jobs the first two months then after that you start getting one job per week. They also say that you get 100% of your tips but you don’t. We asked a customer how much tip he gave and he said $40 but Dolly gave us $36 and they do this every time. Not a good app they just care about making all the money for themselves. The reason a lot of people use Dolly is because their cheap and the reason their cheap is because they don’t look out for their drivers and pay them next to nothing. Don’t care where the job is or how the traffic is THEY JUST WANT THE MONEY!!!!
Trust me if you’re looking to get in to the delivery and moving business don’t use this app it’s a rip off. Speaking from experience.</p>

      <h4>WAS GREAT BEFORE, NOW NOT SO MUCH, 1 stars (murphdawwgg, Apple App Store, 2023-02-03)</h4>
      <p>Very disappointed as I really used to like working for Dolly up until recently. The bad experiences kept piling up and NOTHING was done to make it right despite reaching out to the customer concern team numerous times, trying to give them a chance. 

The support is absolutely garbage. They don’t even have a number to reach if there is an immediate emergency (which more often than not, issues arise). You can leave a voicemail over phone then wait about 3 days for a response or send an email and again, wait some time to hear back. Not very helpful when in a pinch. 

They used to pay well, now the wages are a joke for the drive time/work time combination (at least here in CA). Is $20 worth driving 25 miles each way to load and unload a couch worth it? With gas near 5 dollars a gallon, not so much. Sad part is they can afford to give their workers quite a bit more or actually pay for a support team!!

What really irks me is that this company literally only has to pay the help (us) and their little bit of staff,  meaning they have very little overhead. Although, like all other companies in today’s world, they are greedy and could give a **** about the people actually doing the work. Instead they take advantage and exploit hard working honest people on the daily.</p>

      <h4>Laggy app, low pay, 2 stars (Locallyhatedwrapz, Apple App Store, 2024-09-03)</h4>
      <p>The first couple of dollys you will get will be a fair pay, after that it’s the bottom dollar amount. Living in Los Angeles and knowing the market I’m surprised people actually take those opportunities. Another disadvantage is that you cannot pickup two different orders from one location such as IKEA, and that would make more sense simply because they pay about $50 per dolly from IKEA.
The app is crazy laggy all the time. Needs to be updated, it feels like I’m using Internet explorer or something…</p>

      <h4>Set for the benefit of the company not the helpers, 2 stars (jdh1994., Apple App Store, 2022-10-13)</h4>
      <p>This is another app primarily set up to protect the company itself and it’s interests rather than doing right by the helpers. Also BEWARE THE TEAMS SCAM. When you have someone (like a spouse) who can work with you, they’ll tell you to setup as a team rather than an individual helper and hands. When you do this, you get paid LESS than when you register separately. This is a ploy to make more money for the company. Those savings are not passed on to the customer. 

Beyond this, job descriptions and sizes are often inaccurate. Support claims quick response times but average 3-24hrs. Sometimes they don’t respond at all. Decent money can be made but you’ll have to deal with the frustrations. Also, dolly posts pay rates low and only increases to what they are able to pay if no one takes the job. They make massive profits by lowballing us contractors.</p>

      <h4>Pay/ job acceptance used to be higher, 1 stars (The*Honest*Truth, Apple App Store, 2023-06-07)</h4>
      <p>I was once working for Dolly for 3-4 years (on and off). In my early stages with this company, I was actually making $500-$700 a week (as a hand). 2-3 years later, I got a truck and became a helper. Becoming a helper means more money a week. Normally, doubling whatever a hands would make a week. In my case, suppose to be $1000-$1,400 a week! Once I became a helper, it was hard getting accepted for jobs. They pay started to slowly drop overtime. Then, out of nowhere, Dolly just became cheap. This caused me to cancel or not show up to certain jobs. Really have to think long and hard about doing the job before/ after accepting it. I truly don’t know what happened to Dolly. I was one of the first people to sign up and work with Dolly. It was like a gold mine in its early stages. Now, they’re slowly putting themselves out of business!</p>

      <h4>Terrible company to work for, 1 stars (saint0043, Apple App Store, 2024-01-13)</h4>
      <p>They low ball you the pay out is half so if the job is 20$ you plus the person you work with get 40$ altogether and Dolly collects 40$. They don’t demand for the customers to post picture so you don’t get accurately paid for the job your doing. And making adjustments with the customer gets complicated sometimes.</p>

      <p>In order for you to make money you have to At least do 3-4 jobs just to fill up gas tank. They only give you the small jobs most of the time which is like 15-20 dollars its rare when they give you 30-80. I been getting requested by drivers to do the big moves 100+ but they never give the big moves only the least payed ones. They might have preference but at the end it doesn’t matter if you get requested for the job as they will give it to someone else so i don't get the point of being requested and not getting the job. Its not worth it gas prices are too high and they just give you the small jobs even if you get requested doesnt mean-you’ll   get the job so its useless to get requested.</p>

      <p>They will charge you $40 if you are unable to make your appointment they won’t give you a warning or a email regarding it they will just take your money this is something they never disclosed prior to starting with them. Was unable to make one appointment on the first time and I also just started the same month the policy was implemented As of August 2021, if you relist an Apartment Move Dolly within 24 hours you will receive a $40.00 penalty. We have had too many Helpers back out at the last minute and ruin a Customer's experience, with difficult consequences. If you do not agree to this, then we advise you do not bid on any Dollys marked "Apartment Move". This applies to both Full Apartment Move Dollys and Itemized Apartment Move Dollys.</p>

      <p>I have the app for more than 6 months and haven’t did a single job. The price what they giving is a total joke. If you have a vehicle and drive, after you pay your expenses you will definitely end up working for less than the minimum wage. You are “own contractor “ but in the same time you have no rights or options to negotiate anything with the customers. Because they pay very low, once I needed a helper for one hour and try to hire one from Dolly. Usually they pay $30/hr, but at the end were asking me to pay more than $80/hr for one person. Do the calculations and think if it’s worth it even to open an account with them. I paid $25 fee, lost hours to complete the account and at the end, all it’s wasted. How someone will say that it’s easy to work with. Even if you bid for a job, most likely you won’t get it because they decide who will. If you do that, why don’t you just give it to the person you want. That’s why the moving companies have dispatch.</p>

      <h4>Less than minimum wage, 1 stars (Mneurp, Apple App Store, 2022-12-23)</h4>
      <p>Just finished my first 2 Dollys. One was a delivery route for The Container Store with 5 different deliveries all over L.A. it said there would be a tip for each delivery, but the tip was $0 for the whole route. It took 3.5 hours (locations were far apart) and paid $55. Used at least $20 in gas. One of the deliveries was to an $11 million dollar house in Beverly Hills. I don’t know if Dolly is pocketing the tips, or if there were really 0 out of 5 people that tipped. Either way it is less than minimum wage and not worth it. The 2nd Dolly I did was to move a dresser for $37. The dresser was very heavy and the location we delivered it to had a staircase that looked like it was designed by someone trying to make a staircase that was impossible to carry furniture up. It was the worst. After we finished, The client said they have had several delivery people just leave things at the bottom of the stairs and refuse to even try. Both of these jobs I knew would only be worth it when including a tip. Not one of them tipped. That 2nd client saw us laboring and dripping sweat and struggling to carry a heavy piece of furniture up the worst set of stairs. I have lost a little bit of my faith in humanity, my whole body hurts, and I’m never working Dolly again. You can make more money with Instacart or Uber Eats or anything but this. It’s not worth it. They need to pay more, or make the client tip beforehand like Postmates does. Then we can consider if we want to do the job. When you give people an option to tip after the service is provided, we apparently get screwed 6 out of 6 times. We aren’t waiters who should be tipped after providing good service with a smile. We are moving heavy things into small places and should know how much we are going to make beforehand. The tip should be made beforehand, and we can consider it when deciding whether or not to take the job.</p>

      <p>Don’t join this platform unless you want to work with overseas customer service and definitely don’t reach out to driver/customer support outside of normal business hours even when you’re handling a “dolly” and need support…You definitely will NOT make $1000 per week perhaps $100 if you’re lucky!! BEWARE Dolly will take a fee from you equal to the job order if you relist and this is NOT outlined in the agreement that you sign when you onboard…Dolly will ask you to do their work by contacting the customers to obtain order numbers and make adjustments to orders and if the customer doesn’t have the app to communicate with you that’s too bad you won’t get paid what you’re entitled to receive…find another reputable platform and leave this sham and scam of a driver platform to die!! Even the retailers are complaining about the way they do business you’re better off not being associated with this platform and company…drive away!!!</p>

      <p>Payouts are inconsistent. Some jobs they take well over 50% of the total amount the customer pays. Whoever prices these jobs needs to get properly trained or fire them and get someone else who understands long term business growth. You are not gonna survive long term by being cheap and low balling your helpers when they are the ones who make your business possible. They are the blood of your business. Without them, you die. This company needs to learn to adapt to market conditions and understand that gas is near $6 gallon (higher in some places). Nobody in their right minds is gonna move a fridge for $20. It’s a smack in the face to the workers. You will be better off Starting your own moving company instead of working for Dolly. They can’t seem to keep their hands off your hard worked money.</p>

They went from great a helper support team to only caring about profits and letting go of good hard working helpers for obscure reasons. Be careful if you decide to work for dolly and be reliant on it, they now terminate your account without any reason.</p>

Most of the other people I’ve been assigned to work with (other “Hands”) have been perfectly find. Today (9/6/22), the individual i was scheduled with decided to threaten me when i started suggesting better ways to move the customers belongings because things were getting damaged. The customer even asked for more care to be taken. When I contacted Dolly support (something they make close to impossible to do) they simply said they’d make a note of it and I wont be scheduled with him anymore. I left immediately sacrificing pay as the support agent wasn't helping. 

Use this app at your own risk, no one will help you if you are in danger.</p>

Even when I go to review it right away, same thing. How are the $100+ jobs always gone immediately, (bots?). Also, in the past if I had waited say 5 seconds before reviewing a job it meant my count down clock wouldn’t start for seconds which wouldn’t allow me to accept a job until 5 seconds later than anyone who had started reviewing it before me. Why not just start everyone’s clock at the same time?
