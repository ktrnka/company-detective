        <h1>About Actual AI</h1>
<p>Actual AI, operating under SprintReview, Inc., is a company focused on developing artificial intelligence solutions that enhance productivity and decision-making across various industries. The company was founded on June 21, 2024 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sprintreview-ai">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. Actual AI aims to provide innovative software solutions that improve the performance and productivity of development teams by moving beyond traditional metrics like story points and lines of code. The company emphasizes creating a more equitable work environment for developers by recognizing and rewarding their actual contributions.</p>
<p>Actual AI's primary product is a suite of AI tools designed to assist users in automating tasks, analyzing data, and generating insights to drive business decisions.

The company serves a diverse range of clients, primarily in the tech industry, who are looking to improve their development processes and enhance team dynamics. Actual AI's business model is primarily B2B, focusing on organizations that value fairness and transparency in performance evaluations.</p>
<p>The scale of Actual AI in terms of employee count and revenue is not explicitly detailed in the available sources. However, the AI industry is experiencing rapid growth, and companies like Actual AI may be scaling their operations to meet increasing demand for AI solutions. The company promotes a culture of justice and fairness, aiming to create an environment where hard work is acknowledged and rewarded appropriately, reducing biases in performance evaluations.</p>

<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h3>New Product Developments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Companion 2.0</strong>: Zoom launched an upgraded version of its AI assistant, designed to enhance productivity by surfacing important information and automating tasks within the Zoom platform. This development reflects a broader trend in the industry where companies are integrating AI into their existing products to improve user experience and operational efficiency <a href="https://news.zoom.us/ai-companion-2-0-launch/">(Taylor, Zoom News, 2024-10-23)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Incident Monitor</strong>: The OECD has initiated the AI Incidents Monitor (AIM) to track AI-related incidents and hazards. This framework aims to provide a reality check on AI incidents, which could inform the development of Actual AI's products by ensuring they align with real-world applications and safety standards <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/incidents-methodology">(OECD, 2024-05-01)</a>.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Skepticism and Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I can’t imagine sending my financial data to OpenAI, or any other AI company for that matter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dc1db5/sakowiczactualai_categorise_transactions_in/l7vis44/">(RandomName01, Reddit, 2024-06-09)</a></li>

<li>"Nifty idea, but for me the whole use of a budgeting system is me entering my transactions manually so I know where my money is going, so for my use case this is a bit counterintuitive." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1dc1db5/sakowiczactualai_categorise_transactions_in/l7vzitd/">(NightFuryToni, Reddit, 2024-06-09)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Insights</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The AI you hear about from corporations: It's just software using several databases simultaneously to execute what commands it was given, it can be fed existing content and learn how to replicate them, or create works similar to them. There's no intelligence to it, it's just better at figuring out what the user wants." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv5mk4g/">(Pussrumpa, Reddit, 2024-11-03)</a></li>
<li>"They are actual 'ai' but they’re not quite the same as something like ChatGPT - they’re language models that use similar systems (like neural networks), but not quite the same as generative ai." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1gi5ra0/someone_help_me_understand_neurosama/lv2ydak/">(FigsRoost, Reddit, 2024-11-02)</a></li>

<li>"I want it to be able to work through voice, so I don't have to pull a device out or open a computer. Like a TOOL." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/16womjf/is_there_an_actual_ai_assistant_available_that/ldjt59k/">(RobStoneCowboy, Reddit, 2024-07-17)</a></li>
