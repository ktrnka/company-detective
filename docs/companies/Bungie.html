        <h1>About Bungie</h1>
<p>Bungie, Inc. is a prominent American video game developer headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The company was founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones. Initially, Bungie focused on developing games for the Macintosh platform, gaining early recognition with titles like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Myth</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)</a>. Bungie is best known for creating the <em>Halo</em> series and the <em>Destiny</em> franchise, both of which have had significant impacts on the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Bungie operates primarily in the B2C market, targeting gamers who enjoy immersive multiplayer experiences. The company generates revenue through game sales, expansions, and in-game purchases. Bungie's flagship product, <em>Destiny 2</em>, is a live-service game that includes regular expansions and seasonal content. The company also engages its community through forums, clan management, and events <a href="https://www.bungie.net/">(Bungie.net, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie has undergone several significant changes over time. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, which led to the development of the <em>Halo</em> franchise for the Xbox console. Bungie regained its independence in 2007 but continued to work on the <em>Halo</em> series under a partnership with Microsoft. In 2010, Bungie signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, which ended in 2019, allowing Bungie to self-publish its <em>Destiny</em> franchise. In January 2022, Sony acquired Bungie for $3.6 billion, intending to expand Bungie's capabilities while maintaining its independence as a multi-platform studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)</a>.</p>
<p>As of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees, but significant layoffs in 2023 and 2024 reduced the workforce to about 850 employees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)</a>. These layoffs were part of broader cost-cutting measures across Sony studios due to a decline in revenue from <em>Destiny 2</em> and challenges in developing the next major expansion, <em>The Final Shape</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Pete Parsons has been the CEO of Bungie since January 2016. Under his leadership, the company has navigated significant transitions, including the acquisition by Sony and the restructuring of the company. Parsons has been vocal about the challenges faced by the company, particularly following the layoffs, stating that the decisions were made "after exhausting all other mitigation options" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)</a>.</p>

      <p>About 3 years ago I tried logging into my Bungie onto this app. It would make it to the Allow or deny buttons for signing in. Then it do a fake load and kinda refresh the page keeping you on the allow or deny screen. 3 years later today I tried again and it STILL Does it. I have no idea why I cant sign into my PlayStation account onto this app it's stupid.</p>

      <h4>1 stars (Kozo Morimoto, Google Play Store, 2024-11-22)</h4>
      <p>There is a new bug with the most recent version. The order in which the bounties are displayed has been changed. Now the most expensive bounties are at the top, which may trick new users into buying them. There is a bug where when you buy a daily repeatable bounty from Zavala that costs 3,000 Glimmer, Zavala will take the Glimmer but won't give you the bounty and you lose 3,000 Glimmer. This happens quite often, like several times a week. Please fix this bug.</p>

      <p>There are better apps, Ishtar, DIM to name a couple. I used to use to pull bounties butt it always loads or had an update and just says processing data. I've tried to fix it but the experience is the same. 1 star</p>

      <p>I like the other DIM app better. This app has an easier to use interface but is way more complicated. This app is not specific enough.</p>
