        <h1>About Bungie</h1>
<p>Bungie, Inc. is a prominent American video game developer headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The company was founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones. Initially, Bungie focused on developing games for the Macintosh platform, gaining early recognition with franchises like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Myth</em>. The company became widely known for creating the <em>Halo</em> franchise after being acquired by Microsoft in 2000. Bungie regained its independence in 2007 and launched the <em>Destiny</em> franchise in 2014. In January 2022, Bungie was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment for $3.6 billion, although it continues to operate independently in terms of development and publishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie is primarily known for its flagship game series, <em>Destiny 2</em>, an online multiplayer first-person shooter that incorporates elements of role-playing games and MMOs. The game has been expanded through multiple expansions, including <em>Forsaken</em>, <em>Shadowkeep</em>, <em>Beyond Light</em>, <em>The Witch Queen</em>, and <em>Lightfall</em>. Bungie also engages in community management and support through platforms like <a href="https://www.bungie.net/">Bungie.net</a>, where players can manage clans, access game-related content, and participate in community events.</p>
<p>Bungie's customer base consists of a diverse group of gamers who enjoy immersive multiplayer experiences. The company has built a strong community around its games, fostering engagement through events, forums, and social media. Bungie promotes a culture of diversity and inclusion, emphasizing equal opportunity in hiring practices and valuing the unique perspectives and experiences of its workforce.</p>
<p>As of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees, but significant layoffs have reduced the workforce to about 850 by July 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2023)</a>. The company has faced financial challenges, including a reported 45% drop in revenue from <em>Destiny 2</em> in 2023, prompting layoffs and delays in upcoming content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">(Wikipedia, 2023)</a>.</p>

      <p>they have made some improvements to it. truthfully, the only thing more broken in the game in 2023 and 2024 was the companion app. now direct messages seem to go through, which I started to Wonder if it was a dei initiative to prevent men from messaging women. that gets bad enough that my wallet closes as I walk away from apps that do that. ask x. The second that they stopped me from being able to message other users on the platform just because I don't know them in real life. it is really slow</p>

      <p>2025 Newest update works but new fire team finder is horrible! A MAJOR DOWNGRADE. From 4 stars to 2. You can go back to legacy but can't make it default 👎👎👎👎👎.final shape fix majority of issues - New season 19 it's now broken all the time.like every other company there's no one who actually tested these app - Old Works as intended , ui is easy . Forums work great . Lags every now and then . Only gripe is when using bungie rewards it launches another browser wishes it was within the app .</p>

      <p>There is a new bug with the most recent version. The order in which the bounties are displayed has been changed. Now the most expensive bounties are at the top, which may trick new users into buying them. There is a bug where when you buy a daily repeatable bounty from Zavala that costs 3,000 Glimmer, Zavala will take the Glimmer but won't give you the bounty and you lose 3,000 Glimmer. This happens quite often, like several times a week. Please fix this bug.</p>
