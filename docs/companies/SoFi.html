      <p>Updating review to share my frustration. Firstly, it keeps prompting me to update my annual income. I'm trying to do that, as I know it's complying with federal regulations, but it won't save/execute the change. This has happened several times. Very annoying. And they've just been very slow on improving the app in general over the years. Still feels really clunky. Can't believe how long it took them to get dark mode to work.</p>

      <p>SoFi has met all my banking needs as well as offer services I'd never considered as an option in banking. If I could change anything about SoFi it would be the extreme security measures they use from time to time (although i would rather be over protected than under protected) I can just imagine losing my phone and having an extremely difficult time accessing my account from a new device.</p>

Sofi said they were holding the funds until today 10/10 There are several issues with this. Number one this hold is excessive as per regulation CC, a law, Which state's funds must be made available within one to two business days It goes on to say however that the first $200 must be made available immediately it's 10/10 still no funds can't get food, meds</p>

      <p>The app has been decent for me so far, but I did have issues earlier this year. I have overall positive experiences with SoFi, unlike some of my peers, but the fact that I can't make a trust account, let alone add a trust as a beneficiary is a major drawback to banking with them. Ally and Capital One both have those capabilities, but SoFi seems to be prioritizing stock and investing features over basic banking practices. Thus, I'm probably closing my account or transferring my money out.</p>

It's an act of congress to remove your own funds. Response: 2/24 sign up APY 4.6; 8/24 email saying my new APY is now 4.5; 10/24 email saying my new APY is now 4.3. Thx but I have a better account that offers APY 5.10 w/o the hassle of removing your own funds.</p>

Many people (me included) have to file complaints with the federal commerce department to get access to our money because they randomly freeze accounts for an "unknown" amount of time. Mine was two weeks until i googled how to resolve as their customer service is a joke. Look it up online if you don't believe me.</p>

      <p>They decline every single transaction on my debit card the first time. They send a text message making sure it was me that made the transaction. I reply yes, then it works the next time. This happens for every single debit card transaction that I make. There's no way around it. It's so annoying every time. It's never been fraud and it never will be. Their 'fraud' department is pointless and should all find different jobs because what they're doing right now is pointless and unnecessary. Awful.</p>

Direct deposit as little as 50 bucks to be able to take advantage of the high yield savings account. As of now i’m keeping my Chase account and using SOFI on a trial basis but everything with the setup has been so seamless and easy to get up and running i could easily see this becoming my main bank… Am considering moving my investment account over to take advantage of the transfer bonus they are offering through the end of the year.

As the interest rate plummets the app is less and less attractive for the hassle.  Company hires the least capable and it shows in their development cycles.  App goes down randomly for half a day or more and they go silent on Twitter.

Transferring funds to investments is simple. Transferring funds out of investments to my savings account so I can enjoy a nice interest rate while the funds are inactive is very disappointing since it takes 5 to 6 days to clear or transfer. Other investment firms like my Webull account automatically starts interest earnings when funds aren’t invested.
Can we fix this please?</p>

      <p>I really enjoy Sofi, it has almost everything I could ask for, great rates on checking and savings, credit card rewards, IRA, trading account, and cashflow / budget tracker (really nice btws). I have signed up my best friend, girlfriend, coworkers, classmates, parents, the list goes on and they all love it.

But I do still have some minors wishes,

Invest:

1. I am a little bothered that I can’t sell cash secured puts in the brokerage account.

2. I can’t set GTC limit orders during non-market hours

3. I wish there was a more detailed breakdown of portfolio performance / .xlsx (excel) export function.

4. Fixed income products (Treasury accounts)

Loans:

Refinance of mortgage in New York is not currently offered ( I’m actually upset I can’t refinance with Sofi.)

Insurance:

Currently a “referral business” (if they ever offer home and auto directly I would switch in a heartbeat)

I think that sums it up for now, 

GREAT money management app and they have pretty decent customer service they’ve been responsive and helpful every time I’ve called ( a handful of times in the past few years).

The only regret I have with this company is that I didn’t switch to them sooner!</p>

      <p>The Sofi app has treated me very well since I started using it. I enjoy banking with this institution as it has been more convenient for me than any other bank I've been with in the past 30 years. Thank you, SoFi Bank. I value your excellent customer service and keep up the great work, Germaine Windley.</p>

      <h4>Mystery Fees and Chat for help doesn’t work, 2 stars (yfhhfcb, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>I liked the idea of SoFi and their app felt more intuitive than Fidelity to add money for investing. After opening an account in 2020, I noticed I’m suddenly getting charged random $5 paper statement fees. More than once a month! My email address is in my profile and my inbox isn’t full. I can’t find information on these fees in the FAQ’s. The chatbot didn’t understand me and said to chat with a rep. When I pressed that button, it said error. I tried about 10 times in a row with the same result. SoFi is the type of company that I expect to be able to handle all my business through the app but it seems I’ll have to call for an answer about this. The app looks pretty but if it doesn’t work when you have an issue, it doesn’t matter how pretty it is.</p>

      <h4>SoFi the Communists control of YOUR money, 1 stars (TheOG_Adam, Apple App Store, 2024-10-02)</h4>
      <p>I have multiple brokerage accounts for investing and by far this one has been the most difficult and frustrating one so far. The customer support is poor with reliable pick up times, but best believe you’ll be talking with someone that doesn’t understand there job. With the issue of withdrawing money is impossible and be skeptical of your money for as it takes 5 days to withdraw any money from your SoFi brokerage account, for any of my other brokerages there are no limitations or restrictions to withdraw money at any time. And second of all I waited for my money to pend into my account after 7 days of my money being deposited into SoFi, I wanted to withdraw it back to my bank which it could not let me. So I traded Amazon and sold it right after hoping to be able to withdraw my money since SoFi didn’t receive any money on my brokerage to withdraw for whatever reason. Still won’t work so I call support and she says it’s cause I made a stock trade and now I have to wait 5 days until I can get MINE MONEY, for as I asked her alright than why couldn’t I have withdraw my money before as I tired and she still have no clue or understanding. Please save your time and don’t invest with Garbage.</p>

      <p>Too many bugs and there is absolutely no customer service. What use is a bank account that you can't fund? No physical branches, no ATM's and their direct deposit system doesn't work. So, they won't pay the direct deposit bonus they promise.  And there is no way to fund any of the accounts. Need help? Too bad. They spend all the fees they charge on devising and implementing ways to prevent customers from receiving any customer service whatsoever.
Opening checking, savings, and investment accounts with SOFI has been a colossal waste of time.</p>

      <h4>Terrible tech and support, 2 stars (PirateNinjjaa, Apple App Store, 2024-09-26)</h4>
      <p>I can’t express how annoying it is when companies don’t have terms on the front page. This one has you fill it all out, tell you after if they can’t get you an account, then they say an email will be sent and you won’t get the email. On top of that if you filled it out for a reason like investing and you want to move on due to trouble it’s so lame it won’t let you delete your profile yourself. You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it. Since when do we need permission to delete our account including if we changed our mind and it’s empty cause it wouldn’t give us what we were looking for? In cases like this it makes you thankful for the branches you can go to because the lack of support with the technology glitches are lame.</p>

      <p>Every time that I try to use this card, It has some sort of issue! Why should I continue to use this application/account if every effort to use this, comes up with something?! I only need it for occasional use, but it seems to make this a challenge, no matter what! So I’m letting you know, this card,is not worth the hassle that I have to put up with. Geez!!

Just to make a single change to my profile, turns out to be a hassle as well.  It won’t recognize the new information as valid, so it keeps rejecting the change—Idiot Application!  What’s with the programmers working there?  Ugh!!</p>

      <p>The online banking is okay, it’s just direct deposit takes forever and a year to appear in your account. Sometimes 5p or 11:30p. Need to be faster.</p>

      <h4>Don’t use SoFi, 1 stars (mdl5150, Apple App Store, 2024-09-18)</h4>
      <p>Absolutely horrible customer service. Our account was breached and the bank was supposed to create new checkings and savings account but they’ve put that on hold while they “investigate” a $9 Pay in 4 loan that was fraudulently created. In the meantime, SoFi then emptied both my checking and savings accounts while it investigates. Customer service is unable to provide an eta on when my funds will be available even though it’s been 10 days. Also, Sofi’s terms of service on Pay in 4 loans requires a $50 minimum so I don’t understand how a $9 loan could be issued.</p>

      <h4>Fun bank, 4 stars (izayya, Apple App Store, 2024-09-18)</h4>
      <p>Update: I use SoFi as my primary bank. Love the APR on the savings account and can get a decent APR on the checking. I now have the credit card and it’s okay. Nothing special really. Relay is still great and helps me keep track of where my money is going. I REALLY wish they would make a widget and improve login speed. It take at least 30sec to login sometimes. That issue along makes me want to use another bank. Otherwise I recommend it to people if they are searching for a decent online bank. 

I had SoFi bank (checking and Savings) for a few months now and really enjoying it. Love that it give you spending breakdowns in Relay and you get a lot of features including investing. It feels very robust and can feel overwhelming at first but once you understand everything it give you a lot of information. The one thing I am begging y’all to is make a quick view widget. Having a quick glance into my balances would be extremely helpful. I find it slow and clunky to login every time I want to check my balance.</p>

      <p>SoFi's aggressive push to become customers' primary banking institution and appease shareholders is eroding the qualities that made the platform appealing in the first place. SoFi Plus should be available to all customers, not just those with direct deposit. Some customers may want to "test drive" the bank before fully committing by changing their direct deposit information. Offering those benefits upfront would be a better way to win over customers, but it seems SoFi has other priorities.

Right now, it seems to be working. I follow the stock market and see the CEO frequently on TV, boasting about growth to boost the company’s value and stock price. However, the hype will eventually fade, and when it does, the bank will need a new strategy to attract customers away from their current banking institutions.</p>

      <h4>Amazing Banking Institute!!, 5 stars (19HarLee83, Apple App Store, 2024-08-30)</h4>
      <p>Just opened my account and I am blown away by Sofi one on one communication! Sofi has so many variations to earn money & actual options for my own money to grow as well as invest in various products to prepare myself better Mortgage rates. Insurance travel and offers various benefit loan and credit builder services.
 Sofi is a One stop shop. Took a risk opening an account with a online bank without a lot of advertising. I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts. Sofi offers 10x more than Chime plus they actually assist you in any transaction, department or offer discounts upon lack of processing options. This Bank will be #1 Online Banking Services within next year! Guarantee!!!
Super Happy 😀💵💰</p>

      <p>DO NOT TRUST THIS BANK WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS APP IS NOT SAFE FOR USE THEY HAVE ADMITTED THEIR SYSTEMS ARE FAILING. 

Sofi mobile bank is horrible. The worst banking app I have ever used. 

They claim to have fee free withdrawals and deposits this is not true. The ATM locator is factually incorrect for almost every location.

Sofi bank wrongfully accused me of fraud for two Zelle transactions of $550. They have held $1100 of my money for days claiming someone is looking into it. I have spent hours on the phone trying to figure out why I was wrongfully accused and my money held. Spoke to two supervisors who hung up on me. Finally got on the phone with a representative who was willing to listen to me and put in a complaint. Not like they will ever take accountability. Disgusting.

DO NOT BANK WITH SOFI.</p>

Hopefully you guys can change this soon, otherwise I may have to go back to Chase, because I love their simplicity. All the nonsense on the homepage needs to be removed, so that we can focus on our accounts. I also think the font of the account balances and transactions should be bigger. Thanks!!</p>

      <p>I recently got scammed out of money and called to get the issue resolved, but they said that in order for them to dispute the transaction I would have to wait till it’s done pending. So I patiently waited, for a WEEK, until it was done pending. After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!! I guess it’s time to switch back to Chase now, I don’t even know why I bothered to switch to this bank. So do yourselves a favor and stay away from this bank if you value your money especially if you have the unfortunate experience of getting scammed because this bank doesn’t care.</p>

      <p>So they’ll process a payment for a loan and pull it from your bank the same day. They’ll take it out of your loan balance the same day as well. However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again. Not only that but after the interest hit my card, it went over the limit and writhing 15min I had alerts from EVERY credit report because SoFi quickly posted to them saying it was over the limit. Like what type of shyte is that! SoFi is horrible.</p>

      <p>I have tried using SOFI to invest in and monitor stocks, but the turn-around time between sending funds over to your SOFI account and being able to access those funds to invest is brutal, and from speaking to other users mine is not a unique case.  I’ve attempted to transfer funds over to SOFI in order to catch climbing assets, but am stuck losing money waiting around for those funds to find their way out of SOFI limbo. I’m told it’ll likely be a week or so before they become usable. To me that is unacceptable. Would not recommend SOFI if you’re trying to move on something quickly. I am looking for a more agile platform and have recommended looking elsewhere to coworkers and friends in the market.</p>

      <h4>Like Sofi but Needs Improvment, 4 stars (Gwear818, Apple App Store, 2024-08-21)</h4>
      <p>As the title says I like Sofi ALOT, it’s a great place to do 360 banking. I have actually shifted to use them as my primary banking and taxable brokerage investing. There isn’t much wrong with Sofi as an app with a WHOLE LOT of benefit. Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.

Here is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.
There are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.

I wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet</p>

      <p>They don’t dispute charges until 3 days once it’s posted. Then they only freeze your debit card. Not change account number. You can not close account even if your other bank of transfer has cleared transfers. They allow account to go into the negative. Customers service is hard to understand and wait time and automated system is a joke. Just say hearing impaired to talk to a person. Ask to speak to Management for clear English and customer service. If you use gas pump and issue arises your out that money for 7-10 days. So prepay incase pump is broke. Poor experience from day 1</p>

      <h4>Inconvenient Bank, 1 stars (offerupsucks2, Apple App Store, 2024-08-20)</h4>
      <p>I am in the process of getting my last direct deposit before closing my account down. My reason being is because you can not go into any branch and withdraw any large amount of cash even with a bank teller. Sofi bank teller withdraw cash limit is only $150.00 dollars and $1,000.00 dollars with the ATM, that makes no sense. Then Zelle’s transfer limit is $1,000.00 dollars as well. With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍</p>

I can say without a doubt SOFI is the best bank I’ve ever used and I’ve used them all over the years. Completely blows away the Wells Fargo’s, Chase, Bank of America etc etc. The SOFI app itself is definitely the best one out there. Banking with SOFI is easy and for once actually makes me money. No fees and only profit! My only wish is this bank would have been around 20 years ago as I’d have a lot more money today if they did. If you are young or old, you are missing out if you aren’t banking with SOFI</p>

I have not had a money in years and years and years and that was because of Check.. I hope you don’t take this review lately and you take steps to consider getting peoples money cleared faster than that because this is very hard on people like me who don’t have a lot of money at all because I literally put my last $50 into that account, which is causing me to go hungry all weekend until Tuesday because I only work extreme part-tim

      <p>It’s a horrible investment and banking platform. Their banking side of the business does not communicate with their investment side. It was set up like this on purpose. Nikki in the investment/brokerage explained to me that they have layers built in on purpose. So if you are using both the bank and brokerage when you call one they can’t see the others systems. I spent 10 days on the phone to get a issues resolved with them and never got to actually talk to someone who could help fix the problem. They use a 3rd party to transfer money between the bank and brokerage and can’t see what happens with that company either. I believe it is Apex. Absolutely do not ever bank or invest with sofi. There are many more reasons I have to leave or never bank with them. If there was ever a bank that deserved to go out of business it is them.</p>

      <p>I have had the worst experience with SoFi's customer service. My account was inexplicably restricted, and despite multiple attempts to reach out for help, I have been met with nothing but delays, excuses, and a complete lack of concern.

I have been unable to access my hard-earned money to pay my bills, which has caused me immense stress and financial hardship. The lack of communication and assistance from SoFi has been absolutely unacceptable.

I would strongly advise anyone considering using SoFi to think twice before entrusting them with their finances. The lack of accountability and responsiveness from their customer service team is truly appalling.

Overall, my experience with SoFi has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I would caution others to steer clear of this company at all costs.</p>

      <p>Horrible interface. There are zero prompts as you go through various steps and unless you work for them or designed the app, you will make a lot of mistakes with investments, transfers, purchases, etc until you figure out all the stumbling blocks. For example, I submitted an Interest for purchasing only 1 share of an IPO because it does not prompt you to enter the number of shares you want. So you hit next, thinking it may be in the next screen, and nope, you’re done and you asked for 1 share only.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, Zelle pay doesn’t work as potentially expected with other banks.  Wish the checking and savings could be coupled for easy balancing from savings if checking overdrawn.

      <p>In the transactions view, there’s a giant search bar that takes up way too much space on the screen, & it doesn’t go away when scrolling like you’d expect. You basically have to read your transactions through a little window. The Zelle experience is bad. It’s a webview into a pretty poorly designed interface that doesn’t support autofill. Before they added Zelle to this app, I could use the vastly better Zelle app, but now I can’t. Also the app sometimes shows your personal information & asks you to confirm that it’s still correct when you sign in. It shows my old address, so I change it & press submit. Nothing ever happens after that. I can press submit all I want & I never leave that screen, so I have to press skip. Then the app is like “are you sure you don’t want to do it now?” Actually I would. Anyway, when you skip, it makes you promise to do it next time, so this actually happens every time I open the app.</p>

      <p>In general, the app works OK for basic banking. The Investing side is very surface level, beginner and underwhelming. For example, charts for stocks don't have a scale at all. What? How is that useful? A line drawn on a blank background gives no real information of any price movement if there is no scale on the sides of the chart and horizontal and vertical lines to guide.

A gtc order in the list of orders doesn't also show the current price of the security. You have to go look that up yourself somewhere else. 

I don't recommend the investment side until it matures.</p>

      <p>App has most of what I would want in an app, but there are some features that are missing and I find a little annoying. You have the ability to pay one time or pay monthly; what about my car insurance which is due every six months? Or my trash collection service, which is due every three months.?  Annoying. 

Also I set up a “vault” for my child’s nest egg. I appreciate the nature of the app - to hide long term savings from routine view. That is a good idea!  BUT I have not figured out how to see how much is actually in that vault AT ALL. I would like to check in on it now and then. I promise I won’t spend it. This could be a ME (user) issue, not an APP issue. 

On the plus side it is a clear easy to read and use app for the most part. Encourages saving.</p>

      <p>Worst bank ever for my experience with this account they updated Zelle threw the app and now they got my account on lock to where I can receive no funds but my funds just sending in mid air and I have a business that pays me threw there and they stopped my account just for a protection order I called for weeks now every since July 24 and still nothing and no updates no money no nothing and they not trying to release them. I’m angry because everyday when I wake up to check my account my funds not there and when I call they still can’t do nun about it so my question is why do I even waist my time with a trash bank y did I put my trust into you guys just for yall to do nothing about , this is ridiculous 😠😡</p>

      <p>They closed my account because I accidentally selected to transferred money from my chime account to my sofi debit account… my chime didn’t have any money in it ! (When I’m transferring money in my sofi account chime is the first thing that pops up it’s a easy mistake)! N I explained that …. They said it was a reversal policy! I Can’t access my money in any way ! They said they will send a check when my pending transaction are posted ? That can take weeks even longer ! Not only that it was pay day when they closed my account! So my direct deposit didn’t even go to them ! Which is kind of a relief so I can get my money from my Job …. Can’t imagine if I needed this money bad or didn’t have cash in hand to feed my kids ! This is the worst ! I had my account closed before with real banks and was able to go pick up a check ! This is crazy I probably won’t see my money until 3+ weeks or way way longer ! Don’t keep money in here & don’t get direct deposits here</p>

      <p>Was a matter of time before banking went digital. Just makes managing finances so much easier having it all in one app.

If there's something to improve it's the margin feature within invest.  Those rates change so much which makes it hard to manage your account.  If you get a call and pay it off the same day, if next day you drop under the requirement, SOFI invest will force sell stocks including money you already deposited.  Nothing like Schwab, Fidelity etc.</p>

I have no access to my banking until it decides to work. Obviously this is extremely inconvenient when you are cut off from access to your own bank account. It’s puzzling why SoFi won’t invest a few dollars into a halfway decent app !?!?!? Also don’t believe the referral bonus the day they will pay out. I signed up my sister with the QR code they gave me 6 months ago and never was credited the money. When I call customer service they show no record of her signing up which is a lie because she has a SoFi account. Cheap liars.</p>
