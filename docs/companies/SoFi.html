      <h4>Exploring The App, 5 stars (lexiirae27, Apple App Store, 2024-11-25)</h4>
      <p>Opening a new bank account is always questionably apprehensive. I’ve heard a lot of good things about banking with SoFi and finally decided to give it a try. The app has been very informative and easily accessible. Very happy with the decision of opening a new bank account especially with the perks of such a helpful app!!</p>

      <h4>Layout of Savings, 3 stars (Opportunity for improvement, Apple App Store, 2024-11-11)</h4>
      <p>Earlier this year, the layout of Savings was altered. 

When I click into savings, I expect to see the first value be what I have in SAVINGS. Not the total on my Vault with my actual Savings underneath. 

I have to pause and interpret what I’m reading, rather than knowing at a quick glance. 

This upgrade was a downgrade. 

Other bug issues have been resolved (app quitting when redeeming rewards, things like that). 

I’ve always provided detailed feedback privately. Hoping a public review will prompt layout transformation :)</p>

      <h4>Great Banking System!, 5 stars (Kbryant000, Apple App Store, 2024-11-22)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using SoFi for some time now. Mainly for the high interest savings account. It’s easy to use, and to track finances as well. I like being able to visually see everything sorted into its own transactions. You will have to set up a direct deposit, or deposit $5,000 a month, to get SoFi+. Overall, I’m very satisfied with SoFi.</p>

      <p>So I have to stop using this because I learned when I went to the Green Dot ATM that has the deposit feature that SoFi chose to disable the feature on the SoFi account to deposit cash fee free at the Green Dot ATM. SoFi could choose to enable this saving their clients money on cash deposits. Instead, they make you pay 4.95 anytime you want to deposit cash. If they want to be a good alternative to a traditional bank they need to enable the cash deposit feature at Green Dot ATMs for SoFi accounts.</p>

Brad escalated my trouble ticket before my call was done.  I went on the Sofi app Tuesday morning November 19, 2024 and not only was my issues resolved but I couldn't wait to write this review.
Again kudos to the Sofi team on a job very well done.

      <p>I have been using the automated investing feature for over a year now, and yesterday I got an email about a “new robo investing experience,” but after reading the email, there seem to be no new features other than a 0.25% fee for a service that used to be fee free. A very significant portion of the automated investments just get invested into sofi stock anyway so I feel like I am already supporting the business by using it and a fee is unnecessary. I am very disappointed in the addition of a fee and the misleading email. I also received misleading emails when they lowered the interest rates from 4.6% to 4.2% that made it seem like a good thing.</p>

      <p>This app has a glitch. I’m trying to transfer money but the app forces me to the banking account initiation account initiation page. So now I can’t transfer money out of my account. The chat bot has only pre-set topics so there’s no option to ask an actual question. This is a terrible way to run a business. Don’t be fooled by all the fancy features. Consider a company that doesn’t play games with your money and that can build an app that won’t glitch you out of accessing your funds.</p>

      <p>Overall, extremely poor experience and misleading advertising from SoFi Bank and their customer service was incredibly disjointed and unwilling to be reasonable. I opened a new joint banking account with SoFi in September 2024 primarily because of a bonus they were offering and the rate of their high yield savings account. There bonus was tiered based on the amount of the direct deposits. We met the criteria for the higher bonus with the amount from our direct deposits. However, one of work deposits was not “coded” correctly and thus then did not meet criteria. After a saga of 7 phone calls and 2.5 months and providing multiple pay stubs documenting that my direct deposit was indeed from my work, they were unwilling to change correct their mistake and provide a good customer experience.</p>

      <h4>Worst Bank Ever, 1 stars (glad2bamom, Apple App Store, 2024-12-09)</h4>
      <p>Signing up with SoFi has been the single worst financial decision of my adult life. (45 year old married couple. Successful. Good credit) 
I have no idea how they have the ratings they do on the App Store but they are highly suspicious. 
SoFi’s daily/weekly/monthly deposit limits are incredibly low, their check deposit hold times are unreasonably long and they will not function outside of the United States. This quickly becomes a problem when traveling internationally or depositing cash, checks or running a business. 
Try selling a recreational vehicle and then finding a way to get that cash into a SoFi account….you will fail over and over and over again. 
Checks from reputable businesses, even government agencies, are held for 𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 leaving you without the funds that you need. 
I cannot adequately express how deeply I regret signing up with this bank. I bought the lie based on positive reviews and I am warning you against making the same mistake. 
I dread the work of switching banks again but that’s exactly what we will do. It’s just not worth it.</p>

Apparently in doing this they forgot customers still exist. There is literally no where on the app or website for me to view my current loan with them and make a payment. They have a tracker of my loan payment progress on the home page, but when you click into it all it does of show you your transaction history (which isn’t even fully up to date). There’s no ‘make a payment’ anywhere. Its extremely frustrating and a HUGE user experience oversight from their web team.</p>
