      <p>I love this bank! I have been using Sofi for a few years now and I rarely see a fee if any. I direct deposit my money with them and feed my other accounts. I get 4.5% interest on savings which is nearly unheard of for $0 minimum account. I actually have 1 savings account elsewhere that does 4.65% but you don't usually find those rates without keeping $10,00 in savings. I started investments with SOFi and feed other investments from here. This has by far been the best main bank I have used.</p>

      <p>Poor banking experience. Do not use SoFi if you have a small business, as they do not support. ** Edit ** You could have that option, but do you expect consumers to wait? "Sure, let me just hold these checks for an indeterminate amount of time while a bank decides how they serve the market." With all of the competition, finding a home financial institution was easy: your process made it difficult.</p>

      <p>Forget easy banking, it does not exist! After review of several banks who only do business online. I chose SoFi. Why? Because they offer mobil deposit, or do they? Turns out, they only offer mobile deposit "AFTER" a deposit of $500 has been made by direct deposit or cash. Personally I believe their claims are misleading at best. Though I am quite sure some pencil pusher will have a perfectly reasonable answer as to why I cannot deposit a $420 check! I might keep this account not sure.</p>

      <p>The app doesn't actually give me the payoff, or payoff date, with the amount I am paying over the expected payment. SoFi is also a bit questionable. I can't get a loan to consolidate my current SoFi with another loan because of the payment I am making. If I combined the 2, I would make about the same payment and payoff both w/in the time frame of the original. Too bad. I am now trying to find another option to rid myself of SoFi.</p>

      <p>I have deleted my old review, which was still a good one, but from when I first joined when they first started. This app is outstanding, now that they're an actual official Bank, I have switched over to them fully. They are the best bank I've ever had in my life, I would never switch. I can't thank them enough for how awesome they are. The staff is great, customer support has always helped and replied immediately, very respectful and understanding. SoFi is number 1, period.</p>

      <p>The bank is trash. They illegally place holds on checks. And when you call and inform them of their mistake and that placing 6 day hold on a check drawn on their own bank is a violation of the funds availability act they just repeatedly say "our policy states checks can take up to 5 business day to clear" as if their policy trumps federal law and banking regulations.</p>

      <p>There are less difficult banks that actually will live chat with u rather than a dysfunctional substandard chatbot from 2001. And there are banks that won't make u verify ur accounts 100 times to withdraw money to them. Not sure why I would withdraw money to an account that isn't mine but I have the login info/membership and the names match but surely it's a scam. And this glorifying of debt that this bank and others is doing is absolutely disgusting. I closed the account. Get some morals.</p>

I got the credit card and love it. For me I wish I had a greater CL but I feel that will come in time. One other feature I would like is be able to transfer rewards to my investment accounts. 

I have the investment side as well and it’s solid. It definitely needs more research materials like Schwab and E*Trade, but the interface is very clean and nice which can be lacking on other platforms.</p>

      <p>You can’t get your money right away. You have to literally wait days to get your money. You can’t withdraw from your investment account until they clear the money when it’s your money and then you can’t get in touch with anybody on the weekends. This app is completely horrible when you transfer money to a different bank account like Chime or cash app you have to wait like at least two days to get your money.</p>

      <p>I can’t express how annoying it is when companies don’t have terms on the front page. This one has you fill it all out, tell you after if they can’t get you an account, then they say an email will be sent and you won’t get the email. On top of that if you filled it out for a reason like investing and you want to move on due to trouble it’s so lame it won’t let you delete your profile yourself. You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it. Since when do we need permission to delete our account including if we changed our mind and it’s empty cause it wouldn’t give us what we were looking for? In cases like this it makes you thankful for the branches you can go to because the lack of support with the technology glitches are lame.</p>

Just to make a single change to my profile, turns out to be a hassle as well.  It won’t recognize the new information as valid, so it keeps rejecting the change—Idiot Application!  What’s with the programmers working there?  Ugh!!</p>

      <p>Absolutely horrible customer service. Our account was breached and the bank was supposed to create new checkings and savings account but they’ve put that on hold while they “investigate” a $9 Pay in 4 loan that was fraudulently created. In the meantime, SoFi then emptied both my checking and savings accounts while it investigates. Customer service is unable to provide an eta on when my funds will be available even though it’s been 10 days. Also, Sofi’s terms of service on Pay in 4 loans requires a $50 minimum so I don’t understand how a $9 loan could be issued.</p>

      <p>Update: I use SoFi as my primary bank. Love the APR on the savings account and can get a decent APR on the checking. I now have the credit card and it’s okay. Nothing special really. Relay is still great and helps me keep track of where my money is going. I REALLY wish they would make a widget and improve login speed. It take at least 30sec to login sometimes. That issue along makes me want to use another bank. Otherwise I recommend it to people if they are searching for a decent online bank. 

I had SoFi bank (checking and Savings) for a few months now and really enjoying it. Love that it give you spending breakdowns in Relay and you get a lot of features including investing. It feels very robust and can feel overwhelming at first but once you understand everything it give you a lot of information. The one thing I am begging y’all to is make a quick view widget. Having a quick glance into my balances would be extremely helpful. I find it slow and clunky to login every time I want to check my balance.</p>

      <h4>Worst Banking App I Have Used, 1 stars (graygoat63, Apple App Store, 2024-09-12)</h4>
      <p>I find it very difficult to find things in the app.  Simple things like account number and routing info or signing up for credit monitoring.  I eventually found both, but it’s not intuitive like all the other banking apps I’ve used.  Best of luck to you guys.</p>

      <h4>Not what it used to be., 2 stars (DatBabyAintMine, Apple App Store, 2024-09-09)</h4>
      <p>SoFi's aggressive push to become customers' primary banking institution and appease shareholders is eroding the qualities that made the platform appealing in the first place. SoFi Plus should be available to all customers, not just those with direct deposit. Some customers may want to "test drive" the bank before fully committing by changing their direct deposit information. Offering those benefits upfront would be a better way to win over customers, but it seems SoFi has other priorities.

Right now, it seems to be working. I follow the stock market and see the CEO frequently on TV, boasting about growth to boost the company’s value and stock price. However, the hype will eventually fade, and when it does, the bank will need a new strategy to attract customers away from their current banking institutions.</p>

      <p>Just opened my account and I am blown away by Sofi one on one communication! Sofi has so many variations to earn money & actual options for my own money to grow as well as invest in various products to prepare myself better Mortgage rates. Insurance travel and offers various benefit loan and credit builder services.
 Sofi is a One stop shop. Took a risk opening an account with a online bank without a lot of advertising. I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts. Sofi offers 10x more than Chime plus they actually assist you in any transaction, department or offer discounts upon lack of processing options. This Bank will be #1 Online Banking Services within next year! Guarantee!!!
Super Happy 😀💵💰</p>

Sofi mobile bank is horrible. The worst banking app I have ever used. 

They claim to have fee free withdrawals and deposits this is not true. The ATM locator is factually incorrect for almost every location.

Sofi bank wrongfully accused me of fraud for two Zelle transactions of $550. They have held $1100 of my money for days claiming someone is looking into it. I have spent hours on the phone trying to figure out why I was wrongfully accused and my money held. Spoke to two supervisors who hung up on me. Finally got on the phone with a representative who was willing to listen to me and put in a complaint. Not like they will ever take accountability. Disgusting.

DO NOT BANK WITH SOFI.</p>

Hopefully you guys can change this soon, otherwise I may have to go back to Chase, because I love their simplicity. All the nonsense on the homepage needs to be removed, so that we can focus on our accounts. I also think the font of the account balances and transactions should be bigger. Thanks!!</p>

      <p>I recently got scammed out of money and called to get the issue resolved, but they said that in order for them to dispute the transaction I would have to wait till it’s done pending. So I patiently waited, for a WEEK, until it was done pending. After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!! I guess it’s time to switch back to Chase now, I don’t even know why I bothered to switch to this bank. So do yourselves a favor and stay away from this bank if you value your money especially if you have the unfortunate experience of getting scammed because this bank doesn’t care.</p>

      <p>I find the SoFi app to be difficult and occasionally glitchy. I do essentially the same mobile deposit each week and the app thinks I’m trying to deposit the same check despite the new date/check number. After an hour of searching for a customer service number on the app (the first time) I gave up and googled the number only to be told there was no record of my attempts and I should delete and reinstall the app. This of course doesn’t work and I have to ask my employer for a new check with varying amounts.

      <h4>They’re decent for a loan but NOT Credit, 1 stars (Grafixx01, Apple App Store, 2024-08-25)</h4>
      <p>So they’ll process a payment for a loan and pull it from your bank the same day. They’ll take it out of your loan balance the same day as well. However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again. Not only that but after the interest hit my card, it went over the limit and writhing 15min I had alerts from EVERY credit report because SoFi quickly posted to them saying it was over the limit. Like what type of shyte is that! SoFi is horrible.</p>

      <p>I have tried using SOFI to invest in and monitor stocks, but the turn-around time between sending funds over to your SOFI account and being able to access those funds to invest is brutal, and from speaking to other users mine is not a unique case.  I’ve attempted to transfer funds over to SOFI in order to catch climbing assets, but am stuck losing money waiting around for those funds to find their way out of SOFI limbo. I’m told it’ll likely be a week or so before they become usable. To me that is unacceptable. Would not recommend SOFI if you’re trying to move on something quickly. I am looking for a more agile platform and have recommended looking elsewhere to coworkers and friends in the market.</p>

      <p>As the title says I like Sofi ALOT, it’s a great place to do 360 banking. I have actually shifted to use them as my primary banking and taxable brokerage investing. There isn’t much wrong with Sofi as an app with a WHOLE LOT of benefit. Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.

Here is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.
There are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.

I wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet</p>

      <h4>Inconvenient Bank, 1 stars (offerupsucks2, Apple App Store, 2024-08-20)</h4>
      <p>I am in the process of getting my last direct deposit before closing my account down. My reason being is because you can not go into any branch and withdraw any large amount of cash even with a bank teller. Sofi bank teller withdraw cash limit is only $150.00 dollars and $1,000.00 dollars with the ATM, that makes no sense. Then Zelle’s transfer limit is $1,000.00 dollars as well. With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍</p>

      <h4>Best Bank with the best app, 5 stars (2018jps, Apple App Store, 2024-08-19)</h4>
      <p>Excellent bank and excellent app! I’ve been banking since the 80’s. I’ve used many banks and watched and participated in the transition to online banking over the years. I can say without a doubt SOFI is the best bank I’ve ever used and I’ve used them all over the years. Completely blows away the Wells Fargo’s, Chase, Bank of America etc etc. The SOFI app itself is definitely the best one out there. Banking with SOFI is easy and for once actually makes me money. No fees and only profit! My only wish is this bank would have been around 20 years ago as I’d have a lot more money today if they did. If you are young or old, you are missing out if you aren’t banking with SOFI</p>

      <p>Just left PNC Bank for SOFI and I wish I would have done it sooner. PNC was charging $20/per month with direct deposit. Now I’m SOFI plus customer getting 4.6% on savings and checking auto draws on savings so I can keep all monies in savings. I’m also getting 3% cash back on SOFI credit card, lots of free ATMs, free checks, app works great with real time credit score, benefits are endless. Move your money to SOFI now, you won’t regret it!</p>

Customer service says it’s a Zelle issue and to verify my identity there, yet Zelle’s only option is to use Zelle via SoFi app. I then signed up for Zelle thru another bank, came back to SoFi, and app still says unable to verify even though I’m no longer enrolled.</p>

      <p>I accepted the referral to this bank from my son because I was familiar with the name as I invest in SoFi in the stock market at times I have to say I am disappointed in the rate at which money is available to me once it’s deposited when I open the account I took the only $50 that I had in my other account to open this so that I can get the bonus not only is my money straight from my checking account not available to me until the 22nd which ends up being about six days five or six days later from the deposit electronic deposits are supposed to be faster but checks quicker than that and on top of it I don’t get my bonus for two days I am sitting here with a new bank account and all my money is tied up in it and I can’t even touch it so I’m broke if I would’ve known this is how it was gonna be I would’ve never signed up or I would’ve made sure I signed up at a time when I had back up money I never expected this. I have not had a money in years and years and years and that was because of Check.. I hope you don’t take this review lately and you take steps to consider getting peoples money cleared faster than that because this is very hard on people like me who don’t have a lot of money at all because I literally put my last $50 into that account, which is causing me to go hungry all weekend until Tuesday because I only work extreme part-tim

      <p>It’s a horrible investment and banking platform. Their banking side of the business does not communicate with their investment side. It was set up like this on purpose. Nikki in the investment/brokerage explained to me that they have layers built in on purpose. So if you are using both the bank and brokerage when you call one they can’t see the others systems. I spent 10 days on the phone to get a issues resolved with them and never got to actually talk to someone who could help fix the problem. They use a 3rd party to transfer money between the bank and brokerage and can’t see what happens with that company either. I believe it is Apex. Absolutely do not ever bank or invest with sofi. There are many more reasons I have to leave or never bank with them. If there was ever a bank that deserved to go out of business it is them.</p>

I have been unable to access my hard-earned money to pay my bills, which has caused me immense stress and financial hardship. The lack of communication and assistance from SoFi has been absolutely unacceptable.

I would strongly advise anyone considering using SoFi to think twice before entrusting them with their finances. The lack of accountability and responsiveness from their customer service team is truly appalling.

Overall, my experience with SoFi has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I would caution others to steer clear of this company at all costs.</p>

      <p>In the transactions view, there’s a giant search bar that takes up way too much space on the screen, & it doesn’t go away when scrolling like you’d expect. You basically have to read your transactions through a little window. The Zelle experience is bad. It’s a webview into a pretty poorly designed interface that doesn’t support autofill. Before they added Zelle to this app, I could use the vastly better Zelle app, but now I can’t. Also the app sometimes shows your personal information & asks you to confirm that it’s still correct when you sign in. It shows my old address, so I change it & press submit. Nothing ever happens after that. I can press submit all I want & I never leave that screen, so I have to press skip. Then the app is like “are you sure you don’t want to do it now?” Actually I would. Anyway, when you skip, it makes you promise to do it next time, so this actually happens every time I open the app.</p>

      <p>I truly only got the app just so I could get the money off of Venmo because apparently I couldn’t use cashapp or PayPal to get it out of Venmo, tried transferring it tonight but it declined it asked support why & she said it’s because I need to wait until I have the actual card.. which is whatever but why don’t they give a temporary card on their app? It’s like they personally hide the card number so you have to order the actual card, that’s just a bit annoying..</p>

      <p>The limits on what you can do in a brokerage account are very artificial, you have to transfer funds into banking to pay credit card, etc. I think I'm going to be using Fidelity going forward it's more direct than having to go through Sofi's low interest "banking" and "checking" and "saving" account</p>

      <p>In general, the app works OK for basic banking. The Investing side is very surface level, beginner and underwhelming. For example, charts for stocks don't have a scale at all. What? How is that useful? A line drawn on a blank background gives no real information of any price movement if there is no scale on the sides of the chart and horizontal and vertical lines to guide.

A gtc order in the list of orders doesn't also show the current price of the security. You have to go look that up yourself somewhere else. 

I don't recommend the investment side until it matures.</p>

      <h4>SoFi App Cons and Pros, 4 stars (PCWOOD, Apple App Store, 2024-08-10)</h4>
      <p>App has most of what I would want in an app, but there are some features that are missing and I find a little annoying. You have the ability to pay one time or pay monthly; what about my car insurance which is due every six months? Or my trash collection service, which is due every three months.?  Annoying. 

Also I set up a “vault” for my child’s nest egg. I appreciate the nature of the app - to hide long term savings from routine view. That is a good idea!  BUT I have not figured out how to see how much is actually in that vault AT ALL. I would like to check in on it now and then. I promise I won’t spend it. This could be a ME (user) issue, not an APP issue. 

On the plus side it is a clear easy to read and use app for the most part. Encourages saving.</p>

If there's something to improve it's the margin feature within invest.  Those rates change so much which makes it hard to manage your account.

      <p>I must say that your app is quite confusing, especially to the layperson. I find it almost impossible to go directly to proper menu selection, as well as getting to the last selection I made when going back to the app. I don't know what could remedy the situation except veteran instructions on how to access your app would be beneficial, especially to computer illiterate people like me</p>

      <p>The app is garbage. It’s glitching constantly, the darn app won’t even open the majority of the time. I just tried to open the app 15x and it won’t open. I have no access to my banking until it decides to work. Obviously this is extremely inconvenient when you are cut off from access to your own bank account. It’s puzzling why SoFi won’t invest a few dollars into a halfway decent app !?!?!? Also don’t believe the referral bonus the day they will pay out. I signed up my sister with the QR code they gave me 6 months ago and never was credited the money. When I call customer service they show no record of her signing up which is a lie because she has a SoFi account. Cheap liars.</p>

A couple months latter I login and I am being ask to open a new account, being too busy I disregard and did not log In until recently when I actually have time and not on the road traveling. I found out the initial 500$ I use to open the account was debited to someone and since the account is now closed there is nothing they can do for me. So basically it cost me 500$ to found out that your money is not secured with them. The representative casually told me since the account is close there is nothing to be done, you are out of 500$. This is what SoFi is all about, scamming people out of their money</p>

      <p>So I have been with SoFi for almost two years. I used it as a back up account for certain things as one back I doesn’t offer Zelle so I used it for that purpose! I had been moving and my friend lost his id and debit card and needed to get something’s taken care of! Moving needed to get a U-Haul and had to be out because new tenants were moving in! So he sent me some money and I used my card to pay for the moving and him to get a hotel for a 10 days till he could be in his new place? There was no choice so I guess because I had been Zelled 3000 they considered it fraudulent! Which to me is really terrible! I could see if I was randomly moving large amounts constanly yes! I mean I get the scams and frauds out there but one time! Someone needed access to these things and fast! No time to wait for a new card to come! So someone gave me 3000 isn’t that still okay to do for someone? I don’t see why that is grounds to close my account! Thanks SoFi!</p>

      <p>I just want to say that I have been extremely satisfied with SoFi for the most part. The app is great, I’ve had no issues banking and customer service was reachable in the chat function rather quickly. My gripe is that SoFi offers pay in four. I wasn’t aware of this until I was researching different pay in four apps as I am a frequent user. There’s literally no option to request or apply for the feature and upon reaching a representative they couldn’t help either . This was quite disappointing as I’m not sure what the criteria is or how to add the feature. I have a decent amount DD weekly and clearly it can be seen that I use the service elsewhere. It would just be super convenient to use my bank where my money already resides. Please fix this as to give the consumer the option to apply. The algorithm being used , which I’m not privy to the metrix, isn’t taking key aspects into account. Other than that things have been quite good at SoFi for me, my wife also has brought her assets over as well. 

Thank you ,
Allen</p>

      <p>SoFi and the app have helped organize my savings and after setting up direct deposit I’m earning 4.6%apy! Pretty much pays for all my subscriptions. Wish more people would join in my sphere but they’re not as trusting with going all digital. It’s a minor risk but a big reward!</p>

It didn’t tell me how, it didn’t send out an alert saying someone is fraudulently trying to change the address on file. No fraud alert. No help at all. Very frustrating. I moved out of the old address, my daughter’s home, currently on file to my son’s home at 1618 Ginsberg Ct., San Diego, CA 92114. Then once the change of address is effective, I was going to ask for a new card. I misplaced the card during the move.</p>

      <p>I was skeptical at first because I thought it would be too much back and forth and frustration.  I decided to take a chance after Googling SoFi to see if they’re a scam, but to my surprised it was legitimate and well rated by the BBB.  I felt at ease and complete the application process.  It was one of my best experiences getting a personal loan.  It was well worth it.  My account was funded with 24 hours.   Thank you SoFi for trusting in me to make my Credit Card debt vanish.  I will be refinancing my mortgage in the near future with SoFi.</p>

I reported a dispute of double charge with all actual documents that I being double charged by car rental company and travel agency. I emailed all hard copies and waited more than 10 days with a letter the management still on par of make a decision if should be adjusted or not… never see a credit card company so cheesy like SoFi… think twice before you apply them… 2% reward for daily purchase is common. But once you being wrongly charged you may never get your money…so disappointing company</p>

It’s sad the unscrupulous practices the big companies, especially financial institutions resort to when it comes to helping consumers. I’ve referred numerous people to using SoFi  platform/service and you’d think between banking, investing, and direct deposits that SoFi would keep your APY at its highest rate… beyond that, it’s very misleading it says direct deposit your pay OR add $5000 every 30days honestly I have to thank ya’ll doing just what banks are made to do. #notlikeus</p>
