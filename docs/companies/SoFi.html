      <h4>It works, 3 stars (James Fondango, Apple App Store, 2025-02-14)</h4>
      <p>It works, but it's kind of a pain, and hassle IF you just want to use it as you would a normal bank, i.e., basic checking and savings accounts with ease of access to money. It works for that purpose, sure. But the myriad other options and offers they have e on the app make it about if a slog to do things like order a replacement debit card or similar things. But if used for all kinds of stuff like investments, loans, credit card management, etc, it would get 4 stars. For my purposes, it's bloated wirh features I don't want or need. And their formerly competitive savings apy is not very competitive anymore lc which negates my initial reason for using the app. Still, it does work and they don't steal your money or charge excessive fees like some predatory apps.</p>

      <h4>A Total Unprofessional Headache, 1 stars (Josh Ag., Apple App Store, 2025-03-24)</h4>
      <p>When I first signed up for SoFi they forgot to actually ship my debit card. I got in contact with SoFi about 14 or so days later. They refused to overnight my card and it took around 30 days to get my debit card. Their chat support was also rude. Fast forward to March 17th, I get in contact with SoFi to despite a charge from a company that charged me without my knowledge. The chat representative specifically said that I wouldn’t have to get a new card and that “he took care of it.” Now on March 24th I find my card doesn’t work. Turns out they lied and did actually deactivate my card and again refuse to overnight a card to me even after their screwup and the chat representative was rude and condescending. Plus their Zelle implementation is garbage too, always fails when I send money and can’t even use Zelle’s app because SoFi blocks it. Save yourself the headache and choose another service.</p>

The stuff I do use is behind menus as well, I can’t bring them to the home page. 
Takes forever to get use to, and don’t automatically assign tags on purchases. 
Sometimes the menus I need will disappear so I got to re launch the app. The app would be fine if they didn’t have every menu lead to another menu. Works as intended, but a hassle to navigate.</p>

      <p>While the app is efficient in that it provides all the information you need, it is EXTREMELY “busy.” There’s information overload and because of that it’s really hard to navigate to find what you need. It took me forever just to find where/how to set up an automatic transfer. Out of all my banking institutions I find this application the least user friendly. As mentioned, waaaaayyy to much going on. Less is more, SoFi.</p>

      <p>I wanted to fire my credit union, so I searched for an online bank. The ratings here are good so SoFi maybe it’s just for young broke people. But I open the account and deposited 5K. No issues. Then a few days later I tried transferring 7K from the same bank and account using the same app (this one) and accounts. I get a message that says I can only transfer (deposit) around 1K. Why the limit? No idea. I reached out via chat   Got disconnected because I guess I took too long typing my issue? Anyway on the second try. I was given the advice (first time action) to use the credit union (the one I’m replacing) app to transfer the funds and to delete the SoFi app and reinstall it. I’ve had SoFi installed for a week and used it for about an hour and have experienced just as bad service as the old CU. 3.something percent in savings never compensates for lousy service and services. Maybe it’s not for people like me. You know. People who have and need to access their money. Oh. Please don’t reply to this telling me to contact support. I did. That’s why I’m here writing this.</p>

      <h4>missing important QOL feature, 3 stars (ajgieifif, Apple App Store, 2025-02-20)</h4>
      <p>there is no easy way to view your recurring investments, to do so you need to find the specific stock or fund you’re investing in and tap the transact button (or whatever it’s called) 

banking part of the app is fine although would prefer to be able to quickly see just my checking balance on the home page, instead of requiring a tap either on the dropdown menu for your balance or on the banking button on the bottom.

also a total number for your roundups to see how much they contribute to your savings would be cool.</p>

      <p>SoFi started out as a good idea. But they’ve monetized it into an annoying spam company that feels more like an e-gambling site than a respectable lending institution. No matter how many times I ask to unsubscribe, the spam just keeps coming. Emails, phone notifications, letters at home. STOP the spam marketing!</p>

      <h4>Major Drawbacks, 3 stars (Dr4coDog, Apple App Store, 2025-03-10)</h4>
      <p>Great bank overall but it comes with major setbacks. For example, last week i attempted to purchase a car ($26,000) and asked for a temporary spending limit increase, I was told it is not possible. Even though i had the money available. 

Another thing, I tried to cash a settlement check earlier this year. It was a large amount and exceeded the Mobile Deposit limit. I asked for a temporary exemption of the limit, again i was told it is simply bot possible. So yes the bank is a good one, your money will be safe, but good luck trying to spend it. Also no physical locations so it puts a major handicap on potential purchases. If the people in charge manage to fix these issues, they will be the best bank in America.</p>

      <p>I made an account with SoFi to start trading. The turnaround to get an application approved was abnormally long. Eventually I started getting emails (with no links) saying I needed to sign my application and do other tasks to complete my account. I couldn’t find these tasks on my profile ANYWHERE. I’ve been using computers my whole life and could not figure out where to go. I eventually emailed the help desk and never got a response. Decided to close my account and open one with WeBull. Wasn’t even 12 hours before I completed everything and was trading on their platform. Pretty sad I had these easy fix issues and was met with radio silence considering how big of a company SoFi is.</p>
