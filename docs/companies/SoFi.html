      <h4>WISH I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO, 1 stars (TRILLER REVIEWER, Apple App Store, 2025-01-30)</h4>
      <p>I was supposed to receive a Zelle payment, but it was blocked, and my account was restricted. At the time, I had just been in a car accident and wasn’t working, so I was completely dependent on that money.

I reached out to my friend to figure out what happened, and they confirmed the payment went through, even sending screenshots as proof. They also called their bank, which verified that the transaction was legitimate. I then contacted SoFi to confirm the payment, but despite calling every single day for updates, I got nowhere—no one seemed to know what was going on.

Meanwhile, my bills were due, and because of the restriction, I had no access to my money. Every time I reached out, all I heard was, “We’ll relay this to the internal team.” At this point, I’m not even sure such a team exists, because it shouldn’t take over a week to review a simple transaction and verify it with the necessary parties.

This entire experience has caused me significant financial and emotional distress, especially since I was already in a difficult situation due to my accident. The lack of urgency and care for my account makes me feel that unless I were a billionaire, I wouldn’t receive the level of service every account holder deserves. Once this issue is resolved, I will be closing my account, as this situation has not only disrupted my finances but has made my life significantly worse. Given the damages I’ve suffered, I am seriously considering legal action.</p>

      <p>I enjoy banking with SoFi, their interest rates were unparalleled when I first joined, but they have begun decreasing steadily. The app is very easy to use, it looks nice and isn’t buggy. My biggest complaint is that it lumps in my savings and checking amounts on the home page. When I put money into a savings account, I like to forget it’s there. To properly be able to save money, I opened a savings account with a different bank. Maybe others prefer it this way, but it’s very frustrating for me and I wish there was at least a setting to separate the values so I could see only my checking balance.</p>

      <p>It’s been utterly atrocious the user experience I’ve had with the SoFi app. As a tech guy myself how are these issues happening and not being properly addressed?! I could describe the issues but the list just keeps growing I don’t even know where to start. The app and some issues via a browser make the UX a terrible experience. I will dare name one issue. Where did my personal loan accounts go? They were there yesterday! I never updated the app. I didn’t update Where did it go? I want to make a payment I can’t. The account is not there. Two FA it worked in the beginning for a few days never worked again. I use two FA for everything several dozen accounts. That work flawlessly. Support meanwhile asking me to do the equivalent of push ups. Which I like to do.</p>

      <p>Too many bugs and there is absolutely no customer service. What use is a bank account that you can't fund? No physical branches, no ATM's and their direct deposit system doesn't work. So, they won't pay the direct deposit bonus they promise. And there is no way to fund any of the accounts. Need help? Too bad. They spend all the fees they charge on devising and implementing ways to prevent customers from receiving any customer service whatsoever. Opening checking, savings, and investment accounts with SOFI has been a colossal waste of time.
And to make matters worse, they've been continuously lowering the savings account interest rate almost weekly.</p>

      <h4>A Frustrating Disaster of Ads, Spam, and Incompetence, 1 stars (MonaKlan, Apple App Store, 2025-01-09)</h4>
      <p>Using the SoFi banking app has been an absolute nightmare. First off, the relentless spam and ads are unbearable. Every time I log in, I’m bombarded with pushy promotions for their other services. It’s like they’re more focused on upselling than providing a reliable banking experience.

The real frustration, though, comes from the app’s inability to handle basic banking functions. Every check I’ve written has been rejected for unclear reasons. When I reached out to customer support, they were shockingly clueless about how checks even work. It’s as if the team has no understanding of standard banking practices or how to address issues effectively.

Overall, SoFi might work for someone who doesn’t need traditional banking services, but for anyone who expects a functional app and competent support, stay far away. There are far better options out there.</p>
