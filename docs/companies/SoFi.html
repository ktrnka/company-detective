      <p>SOFI’s app leaves much to be desired. Upon login you have to search through an ad-like dashboard to find your account info. As a banking app, that information should be front and center, not convoluted by articles and irrelevant charts!
Also, the amount due on a loan payment should not change in app with partial prepayment, because it can confuse people into believing the auto draft will be adjusted to that amount.

      <h4>App Changes, 1 stars (Maddiejd1996, Apple App Store, 2024-11-07)</h4>
      <p>Within the past month, SoFi made changes to their website and app to be more sales-forward, pushing you to sign up for loans, credit cards, investments, etc with every click. Apparently in doing this they forgot customers still exist. There is literally no where on the app or website for me to view my current loan with them and make a payment. They have a tracker of my loan payment progress on the home page, but when you click into it all it does of show you your transaction history (which isn’t even fully up to date). There’s no ‘make a payment’ anywhere. Its extremely frustrating and a HUGE user experience oversight from their web team.</p>

      <h4>Worst online banking platform I have come across so far, 1 stars (Parmashawn, Apple App Store, 2024-11-06)</h4>
      <p>The investing platform is absolute garbage. Tried loading funds onto it 3 separate times and each time the ACH transfer failed to process on THEIR end but that didn’t stop them from charging me a $30 fee for each time they failed to process the transfer. So right there I lost $90. Customer service is not helpful at all, despite being professional and courteous (as I work in customer service too) each time I tried getting a problem fixed it was always “there’s nothing I can do about that sir” well can you escalate this to a supervisor? “No sir there is nothing we can do” . Funds take a week to transfer between the investing wallet to the actual brokerage account. And another week to transfer it to your actual bank account. They also do not allow for you to take overdraft off. Purchases don’t reflect on the account sometimes until a day later. So you might think you have a little extra money and then spend, turns out you don’t really have that money in your account and BOOM! Overdraft. I am currently in the process of liquidating this account but since they are so slow it will likely take a month or two. I DO NOT recommend anyone to use this app. Chime is a way more responsive platform.</p>

      <h4>Loving SoFi and the net worth tracking, BUT.., 5 stars (martyLM, Apple App Store, 2024-11-06)</h4>
      <p>I moved over to tracking net worth from
Nerd wallet, and it is just as good. But there are a couple recommendations to
Make this app really stand out from the others:
- tracking net worth breakdown by categories, cash, investments,etc.
- including a budget feature similar to every dollar (another great app!)

Integrating these tools would help SoFi be the one stop shop for young income earners. 

Keep up the great work team!</p>

      <p>Go download Chase app this place is a scam. It says first you’ll get a referral bonus from a referral link that still hasn’t happened.

When you call the help lines for anything, it’s an Indian person asking way too much personal questions about your banking information that doesn’t even seem right

When you go to speak to a manager, they drop on you every time if you want to get your money taken away from you, go ahead and download this app. This company is a scam. The FBI should be looking into them. I don’t know how the heck Apple store is still allowing this app to be on the App Store</p>

      <p>App says if your referred (friend referral) deposit 25 to get 25. Then after u deposit and notice nothing is gonna happen and ask for help, they tell u, u have to deposit 50. Zero explanation, just strait up lie.

App dev replied asking me to call. Called, was stuck with a machine for a while. Finally it says im being transferred to a real person, only for the machine to consistently repeat that the call is being recorded. After it said it about 20-30 times the call ended and i never got to speak with anyone. 

Liars and zero help. Don't use this app.</p>

There’s a credit card, investment portfolio, even financial advisors. Literally has everything. Think Acorns but with more flexibility, account “add ons,” and no monthly subscription. And on top of it, it’s not buggy and it just simply works.</p>

      <p>I’ve been with SOFI for several years now.  Their loan process is the greatest of all funding resources in the U.S.

I was able to get approved for a loan within 24 hours and the money was in my bank within 2 days.

Their loan specialists are professional and proficient in their positions and are always able to answer any concerns you may have.

I will be requesting a new loan once my current loan is paid in full.  

Thank you SOFI for being there when I needed financial advice and eventually getting a loan when I needed it.</p>

      <h4>Two thumbs down, 1 stars (Who -cares !, Apple App Store, 2024-11-02)</h4>
      <p>While it seems like a great platform, the bank itself has some major issues. I have had multiple payments rejected on my pay days and when money is in the account. Reason stated - the payment came through after money posted. Oven never heard of such a thing. The bank decides what looks familiar and doesn’t, and rejects certain companies on your behalf. Problem is the companies are credit cards, utilities, ect. I like the platform and had high hope, but this is a banking app for those in desperate time and can’t get a real bank. Also if you ever want to deposit CASH it cost money around 5.00! I wouldn’t recommend unless it’s your last opportunity for a bank.</p>

      <h4>Horrible service., 1 stars (JayWeird, Apple App Store, 2024-11-01)</h4>
      <p>In the beginning SoFi was doing well as a banking app with no issues. But for the last few months of so I was getting strange transactions, and obviously I contacted them about it. I thought everything was done, but the more that I contact them and discuss that there’s transactions, the more fraud that goes through to my account. Within the last couple months I’ve had over 1000 dollars taken from me, to which wasn’t credited back. They told me they didn’t see it as fraud (despite 1000 dollars being taken within a day from the same person w/ different obscure amounts) and the ‘protection’ they keep promising to put on my account has done nothing. They had promised a new debit card to me for months, and I also still have not received it. At this time I’m simply closing down my account, as it’s all gotten too ridiculous. 

SoFi starts out well, but their customer service does ultimately nothing in the long run, and seemed to jeopardize my money further rather than help. Do yourself a favor and just go with a bank that actually has a building you can visit instead of solely being online.</p>

      <p>SoFi is definitely headed in the right direction with their app and the various features it provides like account vaults, spend notifications, etc.  However, there are two things holding it back:  1) Constant marketing/selling at you.  There seems to be no way to just use the app without some other product being pitched to you through a pop up or through a menu option that is impossible to remove.  2) There are still a number of settings and features where the app sends you to a web interface to make changes rather than having it built, natively, in the application.  If I had a magic wand and could fix anything, it would be these two things.  Especially #1.  I’m already a customer, treat me well and I’ll seek you out for additional products on my own due to the trust you’ve built with me, not pop-ups and silly menu options.  Thanks!</p>

      <h4>Useless, with ZERO customer service, 1 stars (msbav8r53, Apple App Store, 2024-10-31)</h4>
      <p>Too many bugs and there is absolutely no customer service. What use is a bank account that you can't fund? No physical branches, no ATM's and their direct deposit system doesn't work. So, they won't pay the direct deposit bonus they promise. And there is no way to fund any of the accounts. Need help? Too bad. They spend all the fees they charge on devising and implementing ways to prevent customers from receiving any customer service whatsoever. Opening checking, savings, and investment accounts with SOFI has been a colossal waste of time.
And to make matters worse, they've been continuously lowering the savings account interest rate almost weekly.</p>

I set up direct deposit for my SS we will see if I get my points or not. I had to go to the actual SS office to change deposit bank.</p>

      <h4>App is fine, the bank has HORRIBLE costumer service, 1 stars (lmsla1991, Apple App Store, 2024-10-21)</h4>
      <p>I don’t typically leave reviews, but my experience with this bank has been so poor that I feel obligated to share it in order to warn others about what banking here is truly like.

The level of customer service is absolutely unacceptable. On multiple occasions, I have received conflicting information regarding the same request, which is not only frustrating but entirely unprofessional. In September, I changed the due date of my loan payment, and while it was unclear whether I would be charged twice, I was assured that if that happened, I could request a refund. Predictably, I was indeed charged twice.

Since then, I’ve been forced to contact the bank repeatedly. Initially, I was told the refund would be processed within 6-10 business days. After waiting the full 10 days without any resolution, I called again, only to be told—once more—that I would need to wait another 6-10 days. Unsatisfied with this response, I requested to speak to a manager. At that point, I was informed that my refund request had actually been denied—information that was never communicated to me during any of my previous calls. To make matters worse, I was told that a refund would cause my account to become delinquent, despite the fact that I have now made two payments in a single month.

This entire situation is completely absurd and reflects the worst customer service I have ever encountered. How can anyone trust a bank that demonstrates such incompetence and lack of transparency? I strongly advise others to think carefully before banking here, as this is a truly appalling way to conduct business.

Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated issue. Every single time I’ve had to interact with customer service, regardless of the situation, the experience has been similarly frustrating and unhelpful.</p>

Haven’t had access to my money for days now and their awful customer service has been no help at all. Through these issues, I was also informed that I’m unable to close the account while it’s restricted and there’s no way to transfer the money back.</p>

The notifications of transactions is helpful as well to let me see exactly when something went through and not just the date. The app is cluttered with articles and other things that are an eye sore however. I hope they give users the ability to disable that in the future.

Transferring funds to investments is simple. Transferring funds out of investments to my savings account so I can enjoy a nice interest rate while the funds are inactive is very disappointing since it takes 5 to 6 days to clear or transfer. Other investment firms like my Webull account automatically starts interest earnings when funds aren’t invested.

Also randomly during the month your monthly spending will decrease. That should be impossible. You can let unspend money unless you get a refund.

If they can’t manage a feature that relies on first grade math ( literally adding up transactions) then how can you trust them as a bank.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy Sofi, it has almost everything I could ask for, great rates on checking and savings, credit card rewards, IRA, trading account, and cashflow / budget tracker (really nice btws). I have signed up my best friend, girlfriend, coworkers, classmates, parents, the list goes on and they all love it.

But I do still have some minors wishes,

Invest:

1. I am a little bothered that I can’t sell cash secured puts in the brokerage account.

2. I can’t set GTC limit orders during non-market hours

3. I wish there was a more detailed breakdown of portfolio performance / .xlsx (excel) export function.

4. Fixed income products (Treasury accounts)

Loans:

Refinance of mortgage in New York is not currently offered ( I’m actually upset I can’t refinance with Sofi.)

Insurance:

Currently a “referral business” (if they ever offer home and auto directly I would switch in a heartbeat)

I think that sums it up for now, 

GREAT money management app and they have pretty decent customer service they’ve been responsive and helpful every time I’ve called ( a handful of times in the past few years).

The only regret I have with this company is that I didn’t switch to them sooner!</p>

      <h4>Mystery Fees and Chat for help doesn’t work, 2 stars (yfhhfcb, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>I liked the idea of SoFi and their app felt more intuitive than Fidelity to add money for investing. After opening an account in 2020, I noticed I’m suddenly getting charged random $5 paper statement fees. More than once a month! My email address is in my profile and my inbox isn’t full. I can’t find information on these fees in the FAQ’s. The chatbot didn’t understand me and said to chat with a rep. When I pressed that button, it said error. I tried about 10 times in a row with the same result. SoFi is the type of company that I expect to be able to handle all my business through the app but it seems I’ll have to call for an answer about this. The app looks pretty but if it doesn’t work when you have an issue, it doesn’t matter how pretty it is.</p>

      <h4>SoFi the Communists control of YOUR money, 1 stars (TheOG_Adam, Apple App Store, 2024-10-02)</h4>
      <p>I have multiple brokerage accounts for investing and by far this one has been the most difficult and frustrating one so far. The customer support is poor with reliable pick up times, but best believe you’ll be talking with someone that doesn’t understand there job. With the issue of withdrawing money is impossible and be skeptical of your money for as it takes 5 days to withdraw any money from your SoFi brokerage account, for any of my other brokerages there are no limitations or restrictions to withdraw money at any time. And second of all I waited for my money to pend into my account after 7 days of my money being deposited into SoFi, I wanted to withdraw it back to my bank which it could not let me. So I traded Amazon and sold it right after hoping to be able to withdraw my money since SoFi didn’t receive any money on my brokerage to withdraw for whatever reason. Still won’t work so I call support and she says it’s cause I made a stock trade and now I have to wait 5 days until I can get MINE MONEY, for as I asked her alright than why couldn’t I have withdraw my money before as I tired and she still have no clue or understanding. Please save your time and don’t invest with Garbage.</p>

      <p>I can’t express how annoying it is when companies don’t have terms on the front page. This one has you fill it all out, tell you after if they can’t get you an account, then they say an email will be sent and you won’t get the email. On top of that if you filled it out for a reason like investing and you want to move on due to trouble it’s so lame it won’t let you delete your profile yourself. You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it. Since when do we need permission to delete our account including if we changed our mind and it’s empty cause it wouldn’t give us what we were looking for? In cases like this it makes you thankful for the branches you can go to because the lack of support with the technology glitches are lame.</p>

Just to make a single change to my profile, turns out to be a hassle as well.  It won’t recognize the new information as valid, so it keeps rejecting the change—Idiot Application!  What’s with the programmers working there?  Ugh!!</p>

      <p>Absolutely horrible customer service. Our account was breached and the bank was supposed to create new checkings and savings account but they’ve put that on hold while they “investigate” a $9 Pay in 4 loan that was fraudulently created. In the meantime, SoFi then emptied both my checking and savings accounts while it investigates. Customer service is unable to provide an eta on when my funds will be available even though it’s been 10 days. Also, Sofi’s terms of service on Pay in 4 loans requires a $50 minimum so I don’t understand how a $9 loan could be issued.</p>

      <p>Update: I use SoFi as my primary bank. Love the APR on the savings account and can get a decent APR on the checking. I now have the credit card and it’s okay. Nothing special really. Relay is still great and helps me keep track of where my money is going. I REALLY wish they would make a widget and improve login speed. It take at least 30sec to login sometimes. That issue along makes me want to use another bank. Otherwise I recommend it to people if they are searching for a decent online bank. 

I had SoFi bank (checking and Savings) for a few months now and really enjoying it. Love that it give you spending breakdowns in Relay and you get a lot of features including investing. It feels very robust and can feel overwhelming at first but once you understand everything it give you a lot of information. The one thing I am begging y’all to is make a quick view widget. Having a quick glance into my balances would be extremely helpful. I find it slow and clunky to login every time I want to check my balance.</p>

      <h4>Not what it used to be., 2 stars (DatBabyAintMine, Apple App Store, 2024-09-09)</h4>
      <p>SoFi's aggressive push to become customers' primary banking institution and appease shareholders is eroding the qualities that made the platform appealing in the first place. SoFi Plus should be available to all customers, not just those with direct deposit. Some customers may want to "test drive" the bank before fully committing by changing their direct deposit information. Offering those benefits upfront would be a better way to win over customers, but it seems SoFi has other priorities.

Right now, it seems to be working. I follow the stock market and see the CEO frequently on TV, boasting about growth to boost the company’s value and stock price. However, the hype will eventually fade, and when it does, the bank will need a new strategy to attract customers away from their current banking institutions.</p>

      <p>Just opened my account and I am blown away by Sofi one on one communication! Sofi has so many variations to earn money & actual options for my own money to grow as well as invest in various products to prepare myself better Mortgage rates. Insurance travel and offers various benefit loan and credit builder services.
 Sofi is a One stop shop. Took a risk opening an account with a online bank without a lot of advertising. I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts. Sofi offers 10x more than Chime plus they actually assist you in any transaction, department or offer discounts upon lack of processing options. This Bank will be #1 Online Banking Services within next year! Guarantee!!!
Super Happy 😀💵💰</p>

Sofi mobile bank is horrible. The worst banking app I have ever used. 

They claim to have fee free withdrawals and deposits this is not true. The ATM locator is factually incorrect for almost every location.

Sofi bank wrongfully accused me of fraud for two Zelle transactions of $550. They have held $1100 of my money for days claiming someone is looking into it. I have spent hours on the phone trying to figure out why I was wrongfully accused and my money held. Spoke to two supervisors who hung up on me. Finally got on the phone with a representative who was willing to listen to me and put in a complaint. Not like they will ever take accountability. Disgusting.

DO NOT BANK WITH SOFI.</p>

      <p>I recently got scammed out of money and called to get the issue resolved, but they said that in order for them to dispute the transaction I would have to wait till it’s done pending. So I patiently waited, for a WEEK, until it was done pending. After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!! I guess it’s time to switch back to Chase now, I don’t even know why I bothered to switch to this bank. So do yourselves a favor and stay away from this bank if you value your money especially if you have the unfortunate experience of getting scammed because this bank doesn’t care.</p>

      <p>It can take the app 2-3 days to update credit card balance after making an electronic payment from SoFi checking. It’s like you are mailing in a payment! Hilarious for a fintech! It should be instant update as soon as the payment is made.</p>

      <h4>SoFi is great! Easy, convenient, helpful, 5 stars (Baby.Jesus, Apple App Store, 2024-08-25)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded this app, after looking into opening a Roth. Everything has been a learning experience but now that I’ve looked into it. I wish I did it sooner. They make everything convenient and allow linking of accounts to keep everything tracked in one place. They give bonuses for interacting with the app and checking on it, which becomes addicting.</p>

      <h4>More difficult than necessary, 3 stars (Susanapics, Apple App Store, 2024-08-25)</h4>
      <p>I find the SoFi app to be difficult and occasionally glitchy. I do essentially the same mobile deposit each week and the app thinks I’m trying to deposit the same check despite the new date/check number. After an hour of searching for a customer service number on the app (the first time) I gave up and googled the number only to be told there was no record of my attempts and I should delete and reinstall the app. This of course doesn’t work and I have to ask my employer for a new check with varying amounts. There could also be easier access for online help/ questions.</p>

      <h4>They’re decent for a loan but NOT Credit, 1 stars (Grafixx01, Apple App Store, 2024-08-25)</h4>
      <p>So they’ll process a payment for a loan and pull it from your bank the same day. They’ll take it out of your loan balance the same day as well. However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again. Not only that but after the interest hit my card, it went over the limit and writhing 15min I had alerts from EVERY credit report because SoFi quickly posted to them saying it was over the limit. Like what type of shyte is that! SoFi is horrible.</p>
