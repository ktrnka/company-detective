      <p>This app has a glitch. I’m trying to transfer money but the app forces me to the banking account initiation account initiation page. So now I can’t transfer money out of my account. The chat bot has only pre-set topics so there’s no option to ask an actual question. This is a terrible way to run a business. Don’t be fooled by all the fancy features. Consider a company that doesn’t play games with your money and that can build an app that won’t glitch you out of accessing your funds.</p>

      <p>I’m really liking SoFi so far, very convenient, I looove the buckets. However I wish they had a way to select the day of transfer rather than have it every direct deposit. I have 2 direct deposits and it can get confusing. Selecting the day would be much more efficient. Also I hate how it always puts the external account first when you go to transfer. I want the SoFi checking not my Bethpage checking. Lastly I wish there was a way to put a memo for each transfer. All my other banks allow me to but Sofi doesn’t.</p>
