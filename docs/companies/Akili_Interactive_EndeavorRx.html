        <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive is a digital medicine company that integrates neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to create digital therapeutics. Founded in 2011 by Eddie Martucci, the company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Akili's flagship product, EndeavorRx, is the first prescription treatment delivered through a video game, designed to improve attention function in children with ADHD. The company also offers EndeavorOTC, a treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding its reach to a broader audience <a href="https://www.akiliinteractive.com/">(Akili Interactive)</a>.</p>
<p>Akili's business model primarily targets children with ADHD and their families, as well as healthcare providers who prescribe EndeavorRx as part of a treatment plan. The company also engages with adults through EndeavorOTC. In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $523,000 attributed to EndeavorRx and $1.2 million from EndeavorOTC. Despite these revenues, the company faced a net loss of $59.5 million, leading to significant workforce reductions and a reevaluation of its business model <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Digital therapeutics firm Akili to sell for $34M, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>.</p>
<p>Akili's products are distributed through healthcare providers and are part of a comprehensive therapeutic program that may include medication and therapy. The company has also expanded its market reach through a partnership with Shionogi &amp; Co. to introduce a localized version of EndeavorRx in Japan <a href="https://www.biospace.com/akili-announces-positive-results-from-shionogi-s-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-localized-version-of-akili-s-endeavorrx-for-pediatric-adhd-patients-in-japan">(Akili Announces Positive Results from Shionogi’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial, BioSpace, 2024-02-26)</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, Akili has faced challenges in building a sustainable business model, leading to a shift from a prescription model to over-the-counter offerings. In May 2024, Akili announced its acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics for approximately $34 million, marking a significant shift in its business strategy <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Digital therapeutics firm Akili to sell for $34M, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>.</p>

<h2>Product Developments and Market Expansion</h2>
<p>EndeavorRx, Akili's flagship product, is a digital therapeutic designed to improve attention function in children aged 8 to 17 diagnosed with ADHD.

Akili is also expanding its market reach through a partnership with Shionogi &amp; Co. to introduce a localized version of EndeavorRx in Japan, which has shown promising results in clinical trials <a href="https://www.biospace.com/akili-announces-positive-results-from-shionogi-s-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-localized-version-of-akili-s-endeavorrx-for-pediatric-adhd-patients-in-japan">(Akili Announces Positive Results from Shionogi’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial, BioSpace, 2024-02-26)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>In 2023, Akili reported revenues of $1.7 million, with $523,000 attributed to EndeavorRx and $1.2 million from its over-the-counter version, EndeavorOTC. Despite these revenues, the company faced a net loss of $59.5 million, prompting significant workforce reductions and a reevaluation of its business model <a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/akili-sell-34m-virtual-therapeutics-digital/717570/">(Digital therapeutics firm Akili to sell for $34M, MedTech Dive, 2024-05-30)</a>.</p>
<p>Akili Interactive is at a critical juncture, navigating the challenges of the digital therapeutics market while seeking to leverage its innovative products like EndeavorRx and EndeavorOTC. The recent acquisition by Virtual Therapeutics may provide the necessary resources and strategic direction to enhance its offerings and expand its market presence.</p>

      <p>You know it really does baffle me that mental illness is only supported when your young but if you need help when your an adult your out of luck, which is funny because it doesn't go away as you age, it might get a little better or worse but It will never be gone, so it is just crazy if your an adult with these isues, then your down a creek without a padle because there is literally no support if you have mental issues and are an adult. I just don't understand it.</p>

      <p>Biggest waste of money ever. I was SO excited when the pediatric neuro recommended this for my 10yo and 7yo with ADHD. I homeschool, we use medication, and we use screens at home (but not excessively). I have absolutely no idea how this got approved by the FDA. This made the ADHD WORSE for my kids!!! I paid $100 per month for each kid. We did it two months, as recommended, and my kids' behavior was AWFUL. Their impulsivity SKYROCKETED, as did forgetfulness. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</p>

      <p>Disappointed that you have to have a Rx to even sign in or play the game, even if you've been diagnosed already. I'll just find another game we can play. Also reading that it's only for kids, and it costs more than ADHD medication. Seriously, go grab a multitasking game and play it for 20-30 mins a day instead of wasting money on this when you could just buy your medication.</p>

      <p>100 a month price, reflects a play on parents fears more than the cost of research and development. With over 35 years of gaming experience and after 9 years of looking into price gouging products that add the words adhd or autism to the labels, its obvious and disappoints me a great deal. I've seen 100 for $5 turn into $20 a piece by adding those words. This product helps because, he is using words associated with a mental awareness of course, so that's a plus. Overpriced as it is. Worth itISH!</p>

      <p>The game itself is great my child enjoys playing it. However, it is very frustrating that it is only compatible with one device we own. Our computer, tablet and kindle are all newer and yet none of them are compatible with this game. My S10 is the only one that it will work with. I would recommend verifying compatibility, before spending so much on a game that only works with minimal electronics.</p>

      <p>We are using this app as off lablel use as my child is 13. It is not something he wants to do. The coordinating parent app has no instructions or details at to what the information means.

I think it is a great concept and I wonder what the engagement would have been when he was younger.</p>

      <p>Why do you HAVE to have a prescription to play this? If is can help kids with ADHD why not have it be a readily available resource? It's not medication, it's a game that can have benefits to children with ADHD. Are kids who don't have insurance or who's insurance won't cover this or the cost less deserving of potential aid? What are the potential risks of someone without ADHD playing this game?</p>

      <p>Do not fall into this trap. We were willing to try anything for our son so we paid 300 dollars for this. It was the worst experience ever. The kids do not like playing it. It starts out saying they have a certain number of missions then adds missions at then end when they think they're going to be done. Changing it up on them like this, they cannot handle it. That's one of the biggest symptoms of adhd. Do not waste your money. I wish we could get refunded. There's been nothing good come of this.</p>

      <p>I would never play this game if I had ADHD even if my life depended on it. I know this is a kids game, but the levels of complexity and repetitive gameplay it becomes a really uneasy gaming experience. Also, why couldn’t Akili just use a joystick instead of device motion controls it really makes my brother dizzy, and he’s sick of it.</p>

At least there doesn't appear to be any "woke" garbage, so that's a point in its favor over CoD (Halo is alright, though 343 always puts gay pride and black history and indigenous peoples day etc on their "Message of the Day", but its pretty lowkey, unlike CoD which shoves it in your face). 3/5, would let my children play.</p>

      <p>(I’m one of the patients for this app writing this review.)
The game is repetitive. there is no plot or story line it’s just get this done and it’ll be over with. you do the same thing over and over again. A lot of people are saying this. it gets really frustrating and annoying to keep steering for the boosts or obstacles. instead of engaging the audience it just angers it. it’s nothing new other than the new worlds. it’s boring. I know I only used this for 2 weeks but personally, it’s just not working. there needs to be something new! and the game is unfair. the animals move way too fast and a child’s reaction time isn’t that well developed. I know the game gets harder but *it’s not fair*. when you’re doing the same thing over and over again, it’s not fun anymore. and for this case, it NEEDS to be fun in order to “cure” ADHD. this game is not well thought out. us kids are impatient. it’s in our nature.</p>

      <p>My son is adequately engaged in this game but the way it’s set up to play, moving the whole device to steer is causing him a lot of frustration. We have a regular iPad and while the large screen size is great for the graphics holding the thing and trying to steer for 25 minutes literally causes him tears as his arms start to hurt and that in turn affects his game play.
Now we have to purchase a smaller iPad or use our phones (which he says is too small for the graphics) in order for him to continue to want to play. Additionally he is complaining that the story/purpose of the game is not very fun. It’s the same repetitive thing over and over. There seems to be insufficient incentive to want to advance to the next level. I haven’t been able to get him to play consecutively without nagging/badgering him. It’s just not fun enough</p>

      <h4>Would recommend, but also wouldn’t., 3 stars (Ally Selvig, Apple App Store, 2022-04-14)</h4>
      <p>there are many things that make this game problematic.

 First, the game is VERY critical to children and has made my daughter cry because she feels like she’s not good enough, which adds on to the main point of it being very difficult to play in many ways. This includes the game making your child do sharp turns back and forth, the game doesn’t have enough sensitivity to tilting your device unless you put it completely on its side which makes you turn too fast, the game runs you through tests to see if it should be harder, and if you pass the game gets too hard which makes the game to frustrating to play, if you don’t capture the “mystic creature” you feel like your not good enough, people have reported their child destroying devices because it’s frustrating, your child has to play for 5 days a week which would be every school day unless they do it on the weekend (which we will never happen) so it adds on to homework and it ware’s your child out, if you don’t have time to do it on school days your child has to do it on the weekend, if you can’t do it for at least 3 days of the week you don’t get in what is the minimum amount of time, and many other things.

There are some upsides too. On top of all of those bad things, if your child does play the minimum amount of minuets for 5 days a week and they continue to keep that up for most of the time you do start to see a change. My child doesn’t always get 5 days a week playing for 30 mins, but as long as she does about 4-3 days a week playing for the minimum amount of minuets once in a while I don’t see it affecting the positive affect if the game at all. The game has helped my daughter be able to hear me while she is hyper-focused on something she’s doing, she has been able to control her impulse better, she has been able to come back to what she’s supposed to be doing better, she doesn’t miss multi step directions as often, she’s been able to continue trying at a difficult task instead of giving up somewhat easier, and she is able to multi task better. 

So basically, I do recommend this game because even if your child hates it and they still manage to get the minimum time in (or they occasionally get close to the minimum time in) the positive affects of the game will definitely show up in your child and they will also help your child. But I also don’t recommend it because of the many flaws that can stop your chiId from committing to playing and stop the positive affects from occurring. Really, getting the game and having your child manage to do it  is all personal to your schedule and your childs behavioral adaptations plus how their ADHD affects them. Getting the game is completely up to you but make sure you do some thinking about your child, schedule, and consider researching more about both good and bad opinions on this game before you buy it.</p>

      <p>Honestly I think that the game should have a few more items that the child can change such as sensitivity and audio settings for the reason the game is having the child do hairpin turns and is having to flip the device therefore preventing them from seeing the items in which they need to tap and the audio settings for the ability to use music if that helps them focus as well as scoring less harshly because the child in a skill test can make less that six mistakes in targeting or else that have to do it again. Thank you for your time I hope my feedback is helpful</p>

      <p>We have been using this game about a week. Please add a timer to this game. And please allow parents to set how long they should use the game. Also, it would be helpful if the child had to play the game for a certain number of minutes before they were able to access the character store. I was under the impression my daughter was doing the full 25 minutes every time because I am setting a timer downstairs, however it looks like she was only spending part of the time doing the game and the rest doing the store. Also the parent app is not very helpful at all. I would like to see real data on where she struggling and how she’s improving over time. What is shown currently is not helping me as a parent at all.

      <p>The reason I put the rating as ⭐️⭐️ is because 1, there are no sensitivity controls and settings and 2, controllers are not supporting also I would like a little bit more than chasing creatures</p>

      <h4>Amazing! Game Changer!!!!!, 5 stars (Bubba Wilber Williams, Apple App Store, 2021-06-24)</h4>
      <p>I am a family nurse practitioner who has had ADHD since I was age 5. I’ve taken a variety of medications and seen numerous things that are purported to help with ADHD. Here are some key takeaways
1. This is a video game specifically focused on helping children age 8 to 12 with ADHD it requires supervision from a healthcare professional that’s why it’s FDA approved and needs a prescription. 

2. There is a commitment to use this 3 to 5 times a week for at least three months to see results. It does not replace medication it is adjunct therapy to be used in consideration with other treatment modalities. Basically that means the family and the healthcare professionals decide on other things that can help with ADHD this is never a standalone product.

3. As a dualy licensed family nurse practitioner and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner I find any tools that can help support family and improve the disease process is much better than just medication alone. Enclosing research different treatments read and understand with the product does and does not do before making some flippant and derogatory comments that makes you look uneducated and uninformed.

This product may not be for everyone but for those with adhd age 8 to 12 it is a new therapeutic  tool that is a game changer</p>

      <h4>LOL Website says it’s about $450, 1 stars (jadenscene, Apple App Store, 2021-05-25)</h4>
      <p>You literally have to get a prescription for this because it’s FDA approved I know programmers don’t get a lot of money but I mean come on there is a monthly fees that everybody is tacking onto everything these days is really ridiculous I’m so glad I have a minimalist..And yeah this is not some thing that is terribly needed… If only parents were smart enough to let their kids play outside and I don’t know whatever the kids interested in let them do that let them explore stuff whatever educational things they find interesting let them pursue it it is so easy to take care of a person that knows exactly what they want and ADHD people do..The problem is not ADHD the problem is parents not listening to their children...It’s basically a super power if you actually do a little bit of research and understand what’s really going on the past generations medicated and force them to act as a society wanted themTo act… They held us back in school they treated us as if what we were doing was wrong you need to follow what they want to do educationally because that is what is important... I was ready for multiplication first grade I didn’t even learn most of it until third grade 3rd grade to eighth grade I have no idea what we were learning because we could’ve just started learning algebra right then and there and it would’ve definitely made sense to me the 100 IQ is holding people back not ADHD... ADHD does not make someone dumb ... although because society views certain people to be a certain way because boomers even though you’re tested for your IQ and you get 140 twice because you have ADHD they still hold you back and treat you like you’re stupid...I do not approve this game because instead of trying to better the world you’re trying to make money very obvious bunch other people make their apps easily accessible without paying $450 I don’t care how much it helps it’s a rip off for the amount of work you put in</p>

      <p>You should not need a prescription to play a video game, could have made it accessible to all for free and just made a way to “upgrade” your account by adding in app purchases. Not the greatest marketing ideas but they have their heads in the right place</p>

      <p>Adult with inattentive ADHD and a degree in Psychology. Played the demo. Graphics are nice, but the concept is based on flawed logic about ADHD. It's easy to pay attention to games for hours because they're so stimulating. It's difficult to pay attention to schoolwork for even a few minutes because it's not very engaging. Being good at the former in no way translates to being good at the latter.</p>

      <p>As a foster mama I was excited about this game.  This game is geared to so many of my children and looked to be such a help.  Lots of hoops to jump through and lots of information sharing and when you get to the end you need a 25 digit code that you have to apply for.  Now I am reading that you also have to pay a subscription, the costs should be up front not behind the scenes.  Shame on you and this could free a wonderful tool for so many children.</p>
