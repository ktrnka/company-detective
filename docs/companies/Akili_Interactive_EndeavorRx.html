        <h1>About Akili Interactive</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive is a digital therapeutics company that integrates neuroscience with technology and video game entertainment to develop digital medicines. The company was founded on January 1, 2011, and is known for its innovative approach to treating cognitive impairments through engaging video game experiences rather than traditional pharmaceuticals <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Akili's flagship product, <strong>EndeavorRx</strong>, is a digital therapeutic designed to improve attention function in children aged 8-12 with ADHD. The company also offers <strong>EndeavorOTC</strong>, a treatment option for adults with ADHD, expanding its reach to a broader audience. Akili's products are available through licensed healthcare providers, indicating a B2C business model targeting individuals with ADHD and their families <a href="https://www.akiliinteractive.com/products">(Akili Interactive, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has faced challenges in establishing a sustainable business model, leading to a strategic shift towards licensing agreements and partnerships. In 2024, Akili announced a merger with Virtual Therapeutics, aiming to create a leading digital health company focused on mental health solutions through immersive gaming experiences <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/virtual-therapeutics-acquire-akili-video-games-adhd/">(Mario Aguilar, STAT News, 2024-05-29)</a>.</p>
<p>Akili has raised a total of $270 million in funding, with significant investments in 2021 and earlier years <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. Despite its initial success, the company has struggled with sluggish sales, leading to layoffs and a strategic pivot <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Mario Aguilar, 2024-04-30)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Merger with Virtual Therapeutics</h2>
<p>In May 2024, Akili Interactive announced a definitive merger agreement with Virtual Therapeutics. This merger is expected to provide Akili shareholders with $34 million and represents a strategic pivot to enhance its offerings in the mental health space <a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games">(Don Tracy, PharmExec, 2024-05-31)</a>. The merger aims to leverage Akili's expertise in digital therapeutics and Virtual Therapeutics' gaming industry experience to address mental health needs effectively <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20240529504802/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-enter-into-definitive-merger-agreement-to-establish-leading-digital-health-company">(Morningstar, Inc., 2024-05-29)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Challenges and Layoffs</h2>
<p>Akili has faced financial challenges, leading to a decision to wind down its existing commercial operations and focus on strategic partnerships. In April 2024, the company announced layoffs affecting 46% of its staff as part of its efforts to explore strategic options amid sluggish sales <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/30/akili-interactive-digital-therapeutics-firm-announce-layoffs-restructuring/">(Mario Aguilar, 2024-04-30)</a>.</p>
<h2>Clinical Developments</h2>
<p>In February 2024, Akili announced positive results from a clinical trial for a localized version of EndeavorRx, known as STD-001, in partnership with Shionogi &amp; Co. Ltd. This trial further validates the product's efficacy and safety, paving the way for potential availability in Japan <a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/virtual-therapeutics-akili-interactive-strike-definitive-merger-agreement-seeking-to-improve-mental-health-through-immersive-video-games">(Don Tracy, PharmExec, 2024-05-31)</a>.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Akili Interactive is at a pivotal moment in its evolution, transitioning from a standalone company to a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Therapeutics. The merger aims to enhance Akili's offerings in the mental health space and address the growing demand for innovative treatment options for ADHD and other cognitive disorders. Despite financial challenges, Akili's focus on digital therapeutics positions it well within the expanding market for digital health solutions.</p>

      <p>You know it really does baffle me that mental illness is only supported when your young but if you need help when your an adult your out of luck, which is funny because it doesn't go away as you age, it might get a little better or worse but It will never be gone, so it is just crazy if your an adult with these isues, then your down a creek without a padle because there is literally no support if you have mental issues and are an adult. I just don't understand it.</p>

      <p>Biggest waste of money ever. I was SO excited when the pediatric neuro recommended this for my 10yo and 7yo with ADHD. I homeschool, we use medication, and we use screens at home (but not excessively). I have absolutely no idea how this got approved by the FDA. This made the ADHD WORSE for my kids!!! I paid $100 per month for each kid. We did it two months, as recommended, and my kids' behavior was AWFUL. Their impulsivity SKYROCKETED, as did forgetfulness. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</p>

Also reading that it's only for kids, and it costs more than ADHD medication. Seriously, go grab a multitasking game and play it for 20-30 mins a day instead of wasting money on this when you could just buy your medication.</p>

      <p>100 a month price, reflects a play on parents fears more than the cost of research and development. With over 35 years of gaming experience and after 9 years of looking into price gouging products that add the words adhd or autism to the labels, its obvious and disappoints me a great deal. I've seen 100 for $5 turn into $20 a piece by adding those words. This product helps because, he is using words associated with a mental awareness of course, so that's a plus. Overpriced as it is.

It starts out saying they have a certain number of missions then adds missions at then end when they think they're going to be done. Changing it up on them like this, they cannot handle it. That's one of the biggest symptoms of adhd. Do not waste your money. I wish we could get refunded. There's been nothing good come of this.</p>
