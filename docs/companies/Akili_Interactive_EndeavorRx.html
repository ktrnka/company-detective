      <p>You know it really does baffle me that mental illness is only supported when your young but if you need help when your an adult your out of luck, which is funny because it doesn't go away as you age, it might get a little better or worse but It will never be gone, so it is just crazy if your an adult with these isues, then your down a creek without a padle because there is literally no support if you have mental issues and are an adult. I just don't understand it.</p>

      <p>Biggest waste of money ever. I was SO excited when the pediatric neuro recommended this for my 10yo and 7yo with ADHD. I homeschool, we use medication, and we use screens at home (but not excessively). I have absolutely no idea how this got approved by the FDA. This made the ADHD WORSE for my kids!!! I paid $100 per month for each kid. We did it two months, as recommended, and my kids' behavior was AWFUL. Their impulsivity SKYROCKETED, as did forgetfulness. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</p>

Also reading that it's only for kids, and it costs more than ADHD medication. Seriously, go grab a multitasking game and play it for 20-30 mins a day instead of wasting money on this when you could just buy your medication.</p>

      <p>100 a month price, reflects a play on parents fears more than the cost of research and development. With over 35 years of gaming experience and after 9 years of looking into price gouging products that add the words adhd or autism to the labels, its obvious and disappoints me a great deal. I've seen 100 for $5 turn into $20 a piece by adding those words. This product helps because, he is using words associated with a mental awareness of course, so that's a plus. Overpriced as it is. Worth itISH!</p>

It's not medication, it's a game that can have benefits to children with ADHD. Are kids who don't have insurance or who's insurance won't cover this or the cost less deserving of potential aid?

It starts out saying they have a certain number of missions then adds missions at then end when they think they're going to be done. Changing it up on them like this, they cannot handle it. That's one of the biggest symptoms of adhd. Do not waste your money. I wish we could get refunded. There's been nothing good come of this.</p>

      <p>Would be more useful to actually see trends over time or where my child is struggling and what improvements are being made. All this tells me is how many minutes and effort. I have no idea what effort means in real life. Maybe since this is only our first week it’ll tell me more in the future? Not particularly useful. Also, please put a timer in the app maybe something the parent can set. Apparently we aren’t getting enough game time in. I have to set my own timer.</p>
