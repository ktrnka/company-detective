      <p>The app is constantly refreshing/updating in the middle of filling out an expense. Has a tendency to constantly log you out. The app also suddenly leaves an expense for the home page.

Save the expense when submitting not after every entry/input, so the user doesnâ€™t have to wait for the app to update.</p>

      <h4>Slow and glitchy, 1 stars (Akabat, Apple App Store, 2024-08-11)</h4>
      <p>My employer utilizes CenterCard for company credit cards. Itâ€™s by far the worst credit card expense app Iâ€™ve ever used. It is very slow and glitchy. It often takes me 5+ minutes per expense. It frequently has errors uploading images. It takes 5-10 seconds to navigate to a different screen. (Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time Iâ€™m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. Iâ€™m hopeful they will improve the app ðŸ¤ž</p>

Itâ€™s unlike the process Iâ€™ve had at other companies. Iâ€™m not going into excel and populating spreadsheets and gathering receipts.
I have my CenterCard loaded into many of my recurring charges so when I see that charge occur Iâ€™ll pull down the receipt and pop it into Center Expense or Center mobile app and press submit. Or if Iâ€™m on the road Iâ€™ll swipe, take a pic of the receipt, and press submit. 
Itâ€™s the new way of doing expense reports and I love it.</p>
