Also when you enter a new business and hit save….it doesn’t actually save it, you must reenter it every time

      <p>The app is constantly refreshing/updating in the middle of filling out an expense. Has a tendency to constantly log you out. The app also suddenly leaves an expense for the home page.  It seems the app wants to constantly save every entry/input which causes an expense to take 3-4 times longer than it should. Save the expense when submitting not after every entry/input, so the user doesn’t have to wait for the app to update.</p>

      <h4>Slow and glitchy, 1 stars (Akabat, Apple App Store, 2024-08-11)</h4>
      <p>My employer utilizes CenterCard for company credit cards. It’s by far the worst credit card expense app I’ve ever used. It is very slow and glitchy. It often takes me 5+ minutes per expense. It frequently has errors uploading images. It takes 5-10 seconds to navigate to a different screen. (Example entering a job # then going back to the expense). They update the app very often. Every time I’m hoping it gets better but nothing appears to have changed except that you have to log back in and half the time my administrator has to reach out to tech support because we cannot get logged back in. My experience with the CenterCard app is so bad I will often use my personal card on small purchases just to avoid turning in any receipts I can. I’m hopeful they will improve the app 🤞</p>

      <p>I would appreciate a way to load all expenses into a monthly report and be able to hit submit once instead of having to do it for each individual expense/receipt etc. Also there shouldn’t be a limit on a number of stops or it should be a lot more than 10. That is very little for someone who makes several business stops in one day. Ease of use is also off, but overall a decent app.</p>

It’s unlike the process I’ve had at other companies. I’m not going into excel and populating spreadsheets and gathering receipts.
I have my CenterCard loaded into many of my recurring charges so when I see that charge occur I’ll pull down the receipt and pop it into Center Expense or Center mobile app and press submit. Or if I’m on the road I’ll swipe, take a pic of the receipt, and press submit. 
It’s the new way of doing expense reports and I love it.</p>
