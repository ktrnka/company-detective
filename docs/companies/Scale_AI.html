<h3>Product Structure and Company Relationship</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Scale AI = Remotasks = Outlier is a complete scam. I spent about 10 hours going through their assessments which were supposed to be paid... no payment ever hit... I filed support tickets... and they said they would pay it because it was just a bug." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1989kbz/scale_ai_post_legit/kiuizx1/">(Firm_Author_1827, Reddit, 2024-01-21)</a></li>
<li>"Scale AI is the parent company of Remotasks and Outlier. Remotasks was the tasking platform they used before Outlier." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outlier_ai/comments/1dto7kg/outlier_vs_remotasks_vs_scale_labs/lbb0dyq/">(lbb0dyq, Reddit, 2024-07-02)</a></li>
