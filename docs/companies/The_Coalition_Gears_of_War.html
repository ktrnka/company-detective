        <h2>Sentiment: Positive Expectations for Gears of War</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Gears 6 is what all us gears fans want, but id rather wait longer knowing it'll be a perfect finished game, rather than a rushed one like a lot of developers do." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmarzqm/">(MrRobbbx, Reddit, 2023-05-31)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Criticism of Gameplay and Design Choices</h2>

None of my friends want to play Co op." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwg7di/">(Don_Cheech, Reddit, 2019-03-19)</a></li>
<li>"Beating the campaign on hardcore CO-OP is fairly easy. So RAAM is not that hard to get. But Re-up 10 does take a long time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/b315v7/gears_of_war_4_gilded_raam_challenge/eiwec0x/">(TurianGhost, Reddit, 2019-03-19)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Story and Character Development Opinions</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I feel that a lot of the interactions between JD and Marcus in the final few acts gives me reason to believe JD's death will be canon." (GreenBasilisk55, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"Del's death just makes more sense as he's the character Kait spends most of the game with. Their relationship is fleshed-out and developed throughout the game to give Del's death more meaning." (jtrom93, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"I hope it's Del, there's nothing to him besides him being a sidekick." (OnyxGuardfan, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"JD being dead opens up a more interesting story path imo." (King_Artis, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"I think the story has more depth if JD survives. He clearly has more arc to be told." (MonotoneTanner, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"I liked Del, but majority of Gears 5 players are the same ones who played the original trilogy. So because of that, most people picked JD just because of Marcus connection." (PovasTheOne, Reddit, 2023-03-21)</li>
<li>"I feel JD holds multiple legacies. Anyas son marcus son and doms literal name." (RegularAd7458, Reddit, 2024-04-08)</li>
<li>"I think JD's story was done in 5. I'm not sure where else he had to grow from there." (KidCuda, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"Del should be the dead one. Heâ€™s boring, heâ€™s bland, he adds nothing, he has no development." (None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
<li>"I hope JD is the canon death because Marcus only gets stronger after Eve loss." (Flyawaytuna9029, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feelings on Gameplay and Series Direction</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Gears 5 has the best linear sections of any of the gears games imo. The set pieces are the best of any game I've played outside of uncharted." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/186roqx/gears_of_war_creator_reminds_microsoft_you_have/kbbkua9/">(BootyBootyFartFart, Reddit, 2023-11-29)</a></li>

<li>"I LOVE gears but can't get any friends to play it because the gameplay instantly puts them off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgf4fe/">(imsosrslol, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"Gears is not a friendly multiplayer game for casuals as you may encounter sweaty tryhards almost every match." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ich1le9/">(kslaughter696, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"Gears has an extremely steep learning curve. The game is simple to learn, but incredibly hard to master." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgq5o3/">(edgarz92, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"The multiplayer has a learning curve that most people don't (or want) to adjust to." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgkzab/">(Undead_Artyom, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"The campaign quality dropped over the years." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgkzab/">(Undead_Artyom, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"The storyline and character writing has since peaked. The cover-based shooting was relatively groundbreaking when the series launched but is nothing special now." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgjvln/">(IQDeclined, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"The launch of every TC gears game has been atrocious. Every single opportunity gears has to draw in new players gets ruined by the decisions TC makes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icjlr7p/">(randomnameiguessy, Reddit, 2022-06-16)</a></li>
