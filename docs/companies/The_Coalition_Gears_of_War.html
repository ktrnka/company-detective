<h2>PRODUCT: Gears of War</h2>
<h3>Positive Aspects</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Gears 5 had an amazing campaign and MP, but they didn’t add anything to keep players relevant for the first few months." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/gexutbz/">(None, Reddit, 2020-12-07)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Criticism of Gameplay and Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It really is overrated. 5 is absolutely gorgeous on the One X... but let’s be honest. It’s been the <em>same exact gameplay</em> since the first game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/gexvecz/">(Cryotechnology, Reddit, 2020-12-07)</a></li>
<li>"There’s no denying that Gears 5 is a well made game. It looks great. It runs great. It has nice, tight controls, but I’m almost literally doing the same thing and killing the same enemies as I was back in Gears 1." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/gexz3d5/">(SKallies1987, Reddit, 2020-12-07)</a></li>
<li>"The issue is it's completely lost its identity since Gears 3. The campaign's are great but they shoehorn microtransactions and silly season pass cosmetics in." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/k8giew/gears_franchise_is_underrated/gexyafi/">(AkiWookie, Reddit, 2020-12-07)</a></li>

<h3>Multiplayer Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I LOVE gears but can't get any friends to play it because the gameplay instantly puts them off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgf4fe/">(imsosrslol, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
<li>"Gears is not a friendly multiplayer game for casuals as you may encounter sweaty tryhards almost every match." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ich1le9/">(kslaughter696, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Story and Character Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Del should be the dead one. He’s boring, he’s bland, he adds nothing, he has no development, and he’s morally perfect AND he’s not connected to any of the main characters and is essentially just ‘Best Friend - The character’." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99ic8p/">(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"I hope it’s Del, his character is kind of shallow. Additionally, JD continues the Fenix story/bloodline when if Marcus dies." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j995ejc/">(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"JD being dead opens up a more interesting story path imo." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98zbop/">(King_Artis, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>

<h3>Future Expectations</h3>

<li>"I want the writers of Gears1, not CliffyB. I think one major criticism of Gears5 is its storytelling choices." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/186roqx/gears_of_war_creator_reminds_microsoft_you_have/kbbcdve/">(BoBoBearDev, Reddit, 2023-11-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Kids don’t like gears because it’s not a BR game or crafting game you can literally waste 5 hours doing nothing but bullshitting around." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmhw2u7/">(Chotchaholic, Reddit, 2023-06-01)</a></li>
<li>"Campaign wise the quality dropped over the years. Multiplayer has a learning curve that most people don't (or want) to adjust to." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/icgkzab/">(Undead_Artyom, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>
