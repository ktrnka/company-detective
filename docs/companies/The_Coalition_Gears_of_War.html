<h2>Concerns About Gameplay and Features</h2>
<ul>

<li>"I kind of feel like this will turn off some newer players, especially reaching Re-Up 10." (cmchaunce, Reddit, 2019-03-19)</li>
<li>"The co-op campaign will be tough, I know I have a couple of players who might be willing to assist but I want to get that done as I can grind away at Horde myself in part but really want to get this character." (SightlessKombat, Reddit, 2019-03-19)</li>
<li>"Gears is not a friendly multiplayer game for casuals as you may encounter sweaty tryhards almost every match." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/vcttwn/can_someone_explain_how_a_game_this_good_doesnt/ich1le9/">(kslaughter696, Reddit, 2022-06-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Anticipation for Future Gears of War Titles</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Gears 6 is what all us gears fans want, but id rather wait longer knowing it'll be a perfect finished game, rather than a rushed one like a lot of developers do." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmarzqm/">(MrRobbbx, Reddit, 2023-05-31)</a></li>
<li>"The fact they only started moving over to unreal engine 5 last year of May, tells you all you need to know, all we will get for gears of war, is a teaser trailer for 'Gears 6' at best, this year or next year or the year after." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmgiuhm/">(None, Reddit, 2023-06-01)</a></li>
<li>"I hope we get a Fenix collection announcement they might do what they did for gears 4 and ue where they released UE to bring people back into gears after Judgement failing then a year later releasing gears 4." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/13w5llv/we_are_getting_gears_of_war_6_at_the_xbox/jmd5erx/">(IKarma88, Reddit, 2023-05-31)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Character Development and Storyline Opinions</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Del should be the dead one. He’s boring, he’s bland, he adds nothing, he has no development, and he’s morally perfect AND he’s not connected to any of the main characters and is essentially just ‘Best Friend - The character’." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j997aup/">(None, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"I hope it's Del, there's nothing to him besides him being a sidekick." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98thb5/">(OnyxGuardfan, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"JD being dead opens up a more interesting story path imo." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98zbop/">(King_Artis, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"I think the story has more depth if JD survives. He clearly has more arc to be told." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j98x35l/">(MonotoneTanner, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
<li>"Del's death just makes more sense as he's the character Kait spends most of the game with. Their relationship is fleshed-out and developed throughout the game to give Del's death more meaning." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/116vl2s/who_do_you_guys_hope_the_canon_death_and_why/j99qcez/">(jtrom93, Reddit, 2023-02-20)</a></li>
