        <h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Product (Perle)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I find Perle Noire can get smear-y if it dries out a bit in the nib." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/uenwac/does_the_ink_always_smear/i6ofw8e/">(fivezero_ca, Reddit, 2022-04-29)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback on Product (Indigo Smoke)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I love Indigo Smoke, but it's not as smokey/savory as the lapsang souchong that I've experienced. Still a very beautiful, almost rainy-day kind of melancholic/pensive experience." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1b6qtwf/roundup_of_all_of_the_tea_fragrances_ive_tried/ktneaof/">(Nemorensis91, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback on Other Products</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I have COVID and have been coughing up blood/getting bloody noses. Doctor was going to prescribe a antiviral but didn’t because of a medication I take regularly. She then said something about codein pills then gave me this shit instead. I don’t feel any relief, and now I’m reading it kills children? Wtf? Waste of money and time fuck patient first" (One_Relationship_815, Reddit, 2023-02-01)</li>
<li>"Pretty much worthless and gives me a mega runny nose." (Testcapo7579, Reddit, 2023-02-09)</li>
<li>"I came here after searching for the effectiveness of this medicine, as it has done NOTHING to help my cough and now my throat itches like crazy and I have a huge headache from coughing so much. I went to the 'Urgent Clinic' since the night before was nightmare, but I didn't get the medicine until the next day. While waiting for Walgreens to get the Benzonatate pills, I used Day/nyquil, and it did a much better job than these prescription pills, which might have been as good as tic tacs. What a joke." (HappyGirl117, Reddit, 2023-02-19)</li>
