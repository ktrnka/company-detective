<h2>FTC Settlement and Data Breach</h2>

This breach raised concerns about the company's data security practices, particularly as it involved sensitive locations like psychiatric hospitals and schools <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/verkada-settles-ftc-probe-of-hack-exposing-tesla-hospitals-1">(Verkada Settles FTC Probe of Hack Exposing Tesla, Hospitals, 2024)</a>.

<p>On August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with Verkada, requiring the company to pay a $2.95 million penalty and implement a comprehensive information security program.

      <p>This app works really well but sometime recently when I try to log in to the App with my Authentication code, the verify button is on the top of the app screen and I can’t actually press it to log in. I don’t know when this issue first started or if it’s something with just my phone.</p>

      <p>Recently we’ve lost the ability to remotely unlock doors using the command app on iPhones only. All the doors show offline and the unlock button is greyed out. Both the website and my android phone can still do this. Company only supplies iPhones so this is a big issue for our site admins.</p>

Very frustrating as I use this for work to manage my department. I can use the web browser to check things but the app was much easier to use. Please fix!</p>

      <h4>Excellent hardware, poor software, 2 stars (frjps, Apple App Store, 2023-10-05)</h4>
      <p>I really wanted to like this. The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.</p>

      <h4>App locks phone, 3 stars (DM Cali, Apple App Store, 2023-04-20)</h4>
      <p>This app freezes my iso phone. The screen locks frozen, I cannot get out of the app, reboot my phone or make or take phone calls. I reported this is with no response. 

I though it was my phone, I then got a new iPhone and it does the same thing. I put the app on my wife’s iPhone and she reported the same issue. It’s not every time but it happens on average every 3 times I use it to view video of my office. 

What’s more concerning is, should I be in an emergency and this happens I will not be able to call anyone. When I say it freezes my phone it freezes everything. The time does not even change… 3-6 min each time. 

Serious issue needs to be resolved.</p>

      <p>Why is it so difficult to make Command remember who I am, and have a seamless, effortless Face ID authentication experience each time I use the app? 
Why is it if I wait three days, and then try to use the app again, I am prompted with no fewer than three screens requesting credentials in preposterous ways? No, I do not need a link emailed to me so I can login using the same phone I’ve had for over two years now, and have FaceID working fine on… seriously guys, there has to be a better, less frustrating way.</p>

      <p>I was really excited about this company but after going to the trouble to get a trial camera I conclude I cannot trust these guys with the security of my company’s facility. The iPhone app is literally unusable. Can’t even register my trial camera. Every attempted action in the app causes it to freeze. I lost interest in Verkada within 5 minutes of trying to set up my trial. How can anyone entrust their security to this outfit if they don’t even bother to test their app for the most basic functions? Avoid.</p>
