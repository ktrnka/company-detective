      <p>Not as great as it is on IOS, I used this app first on iPhone for my job and it worked perfectly without any issues. Decided to switch to Android and downloaded this app. Not sure why there is such a big difference as far as user experience. You would think it'd actuslly work better on Android with more options for permissions and what not but nope. Unfortunately I need this app so I'm stuck using it this way until it's either updated or I eventually go back to apple because "it just works".</p>

It would be really helpful to be able to set working hours/days so as not to get notifications when you're out of office.

      <p>Not a big fan. For our installation, the Bluetooth Unlock works well on 2 of 3 doors, and very poorly on the third, which just happens to be our main entrance; daily aggravation ensues. My main complaints about this app are A) it doesn't start automatically and B) it doesn't stay running. I have another app that without these issue, so why can't Verkada do it too? I have more words to share, but not enough characters left to write them in this review.</p>

      <p>Edit: app started working normally. Updated to 3 star. App is completely blank / black after logging in. Issue reporting doesn't work. This is probably the poorest designed app I have ever used, since Android 1.5; no error handling and probably very poor QA if this happens on a stable release. I'll update my rating if fixes come thru but... Also, why on earth would you use bluetooth stack for presence authentication. It is an unreliable technology outside of the handsfree/audio profiles.</p>

The median income for apple users being about 20k higher I'm sure has a lot to do with it. 🙃</p>

      <p>This app is convenient when it actually works, but unfortunately it rarely does. The building I work in switched from keycards to this system saying it would be easier to get in and out of offices by just having our phones on us, but I have to physically open the app and hit the unlock button for any areas I need access to basically every time. Even then, the app is so slow and sometimes doesn't even bring up the location I need entrance to even when I'm standing right next to the sensor.</p>

      <p>Very regularly doesn't work. I'll be right next to a reader, and it's not detected as nearby. The only thing that reliably works is restarting my phone -- it's really fun waiting 2-3 minutes to get into the elevators. This app is the reason that I'm not gonna renew my lease. Great when it actually works... but that's only about 25% of the time, so two stars is already generous.</p>

      <h4>Excellent hardware, poor software, 2 stars (frjps, Apple App Store, 2023-10-05)</h4>
      <p>I really wanted to like this. The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.</p>

      <h4>App locks phone, 3 stars (DM Cali, Apple App Store, 2023-04-20)</h4>
      <p>This app freezes my iso phone. The screen locks frozen, I cannot get out of the app, reboot my phone or make or take phone calls. I reported this is with no response. 

I though it was my phone, I then got a new iPhone and it does the same thing. I put the app on my wife’s iPhone and she reported the same issue. It’s not every time but it happens on average every 3 times I use it to view video of my office. 

What’s more concerning is, should I be in an emergency and this happens I will not be able to call anyone. When I say it freezes my phone it freezes everything. The time does not even change… 3-6 min each time. 

Serious issue needs to be resolved.</p>

Why is it if I wait three days, and then try to use the app again, I am prompted with no fewer than three screens requesting credentials in preposterous ways? No, I do not need a link emailed to me so I can login using the same phone I’ve had for over two years now, and have FaceID working fine on… seriously guys, there has to be a better, less frustrating way.</p>

The iPhone app is literally unusable. Can’t even register my trial camera. Every attempted action in the app causes it to freeze. I lost interest in Verkada within 5 minutes of trying to set up my trial. How can anyone entrust their security to this outfit if they don’t even bother to test their app for the most basic functions? Avoid.</p>
