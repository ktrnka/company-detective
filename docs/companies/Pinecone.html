<h3>Performance Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Pinecone has shit latency and the API randomly craps out." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vectordatabase/comments/170j6zd/my_strategy_for_picking_a_vector_database_a/k3m1n6h/">(Christosconst, Reddit, 2023-10-05)</a></li>

<li>"In my experience, Pinecone is good for basics but you hit a roof very quickly if you want to support normal query." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12m9pg0/alternatives_to_pinecone_vector_databases_d/jrzzh3o/">(Temporary-Koala-7370, Reddit, 2023-07-14)</a></li>
<li>"I have liked using the service, very simple to set up and use, but now running into a roadblock in production because of the performance being not just bad, but unusable." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12m9pg0/alternatives_to_pinecone_vector_databases_d/kwn4ngu/">(LeastIntroduction366, Reddit, 2024-03-26)</a></li>

<h2>PRODUCT Pinecone</h2>
<h3>General Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Pinecone is a vector database." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/12wn63m/i_have_made_some_easy_tools_to_rip_webpages_clean/jhfy6b0/">(None, Reddit, 2023-04-23)</a></li>
<li>"The key is that using a vector DB makes it more efficient to do vector lookups in the face of tons of data." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/12wn63m/i_have_made_some_easy_tools_to_rip_webpages_clean/jhj6vcz/">(tyliggity, Reddit, 2023-04-24)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases and Advantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>"If you have billions of documents and want to make a semantic search engine, where the user inputs a question and the database immediately tells you the top 20 document chunks most similar in topic to the question, a vector database can do that while scaling horizontally and doing map-reduce." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/107vhoq/vector_databases_like_pinecone_or_weaviate_are/jiy9zgs/">(None, Reddit, 2023-05-05)</a></li>
<li>"Pinecone &amp; Weaviate have the latest tech built into products for doc search and/or Q&amp;A right now: Hybrid search." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/15h3c5e/document_query_solution_for_small_business/jum5jsr/">(vap0rtranz, Reddit, 2023-08-03)</a></li>
<li>"Pinecone also saw better performance of models trained to Q&amp;A with hybrid compared to lexical or semantic searches." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/15h3c5e/document_query_solution_for_small_business/jum5jsr/">(vap0rtranz, Reddit, 2023-08-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations and Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I don't think so. Vector databases have a handful of disadvantages." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/107vhoq/vector_databases_like_pinecone_or_weaviate_are/j45p8qq/">(Just_CurioussSss, Reddit, 2023-01-13)</a></li>
<li>"Vector databases can be less flexible in terms of data management and querying than traditional databases." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/107vhoq/vector_databases_like_pinecone_or_weaviate_are/j45p8qq/">(Just_CurioussSss, Reddit, 2023-01-13)</a></li>
<li>"Vector databases might have a higher latency than other databases, especially when the data size is large, or the queries are complex." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/107vhoq/vector_databases_like_pinecone_or_weaviate_are/j45p8qq/">(Just_CurioussSss, Reddit, 2023-01-13)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Integration with AI and Embeddings</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I believe what you are looking for is called embedding. I just did this for an in-house document that was roughly 200~ pages. You can then do math against these vectors to pull the top X results to feed in with your question." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg0l716/">(Zulugod94, Reddit, 2023-04-12)</a></li>
<li>"From what I've seen it works exceptionally well with gpt4. Both because of the additional intelligence of 4 but also the 8k token limit it a huge help." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg0w4ok/">(Zulugod94, Reddit, 2023-04-12)</a></li>
<li>"You can then store those embeddings in a vector db (like pinecone). When you have a query you want to run against the large document, you take your question, calculate the embedding of it and then ask the vector db which of the many 1000 character chunks are most relevant to your question." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg11jjm/">(Icanteven______, Reddit, 2023-04-12)</a></li>
<li>"It varies by AI, but OpenAI solutions are premised on embeddings. Large text searches are actually cosine-similarity searches on split chunks, using the most similar chunks in the completion prompt." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg0peys/">(MatchaGaucho, Reddit, 2023-04-12)</a></li>
<li>"You can use LangChain to assist, but essentially you’re calling the OpenAI embeddings API to map your large document into a bunch of numbered vector documents that 'embed' their semantic meaning." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg11jjm/">(Icanteven______, Reddit, 2023-04-12)</a></li>
<li>"The embeddings themselves are just a static database of vectors, they simply represent the 'value' of chunks of text so you can search for related chunks quickly." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/12jyes5/what_are_good_techniques_for_feeding_extremely/jg2skiy/">(Zulugod94, Reddit, 2023-04-13)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>User Feedback and Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I’m just using gpt3.5 and pinecone, since there’s so much info on using them and they’re super straight forward." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my_experience_on_starting_with_fine_tuning_llms/jreg8tn/">(BlandUnicorn, Reddit, 2023-07-10)</a></li>
<li>"I have been working on improving the data to work better with a vector db, and plain chunked text isn’t great." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my_experience_on_starting_with_fine_tuning_llms/jreg8tn/">(BlandUnicorn, Reddit, 2023-07-10)</a></li>
<li>"I do plan on switching to a local vector db later when I’ve worked out the best data format to feed it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my_experience_on_starting_with_fine_tuning_llms/jreg8tn/">(BlandUnicorn, Reddit, 2023-07-10)</a></li>
