<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I found that these essays were a joy to read. A collection of writings from some of the brightest minds in the synod, alongside the always relevant words of Martin Luther, this book did not disappoint." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/">(Michael Speckhard, Reddit, 2023-01-27)</a></li>
<li>"Should the pause be lifted and the book become available again, I would recommend it without reservation for any laymen or clergymen who desire to see what Luther's words mean for us today." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/">(Michael Speckhard, Reddit, 2023-01-27)</a></li>
<li>"I couldn't recommend the book enough. I wouldn't sweat the online outrage too much; the very nature of the internet brings out the worst in people and often makes them do and say things in ways they would otherwise never do or say." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j69otrb/">(None, Reddit, 2023-01-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Skepticism</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I do get very suspicious of online outrage, especially on Twitter." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j69fi7r/">(Michigander07, Reddit, 2023-01-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>PRODUCT Variata</h2>
<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Perhaps if the essays had been placed collectively apart from the material in the Larger Catechism that might have helped 'rope off' opinion from Luther's original material." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LCMS/comments/10m8q2b/a_book_review_of_the_annotated_large_catechism/j74gywv/">(Dear_Pair7015, Reddit, 2023-02-04)</a></li>
