        <h1>About A Place for Mom</h1>
<p>A Place for Mom (APFM) is the largest senior living referral service in North America, founded on July 1, 2000. The company is owned by private equity firms Silver Lake and General Atlantic. It provides personalized guidance to families seeking senior care options, including assisted living, memory care, independent living, and home care. APFM operates a platform that lists approximately 14,000 establishments across the U.S. and is funded through commissions from these facilities for successful referrals <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>.</p>
<p>APFM offers a free service to families, connecting them with senior living communities and home care providers. Their services include personalized guidance, access to a vast network of senior living communities, and assistance in understanding costs and payment options for senior care. The company specializes in various senior living options, such as independent living, assisted living, memory care, nursing homes, and home care <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aplaceformom">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>The company serves families looking for senior care solutions, helping them make informed decisions about their loved ones' care needs. APFM is a B2C company, with its revenue model based on commissions from partner facilities. The company has been named one of the fastest-growing firms in the United States, receiving more than 60,000 inquiries from family members per month <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aplaceformom">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>APFM has faced scrutiny regarding its business practices, particularly accusations of misleading families about the nature of its services and the quality of the facilities it recommends <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>. Despite this, the company continues to be a significant player in the senior care referral space.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Tatyana Zlotsky is the CEO of A Place for Mom, having taken on the role in April 2024. She focuses on improving relationships with senior living operators and enhancing the referral process. Under her leadership, the company has restructured its advisor roles and introduced new teams to better connect families with communities <a href="https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/">(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Senate Investigation</h2>
<p>In June 2024, the Senate Special Committee on Aging initiated an investigation into A Place for Mom, prompted by allegations that the company directs families to facilities with documented safety violations while profiting from referral fees. Senator Bob Casey criticized the company for allegedly upselling families and for not adequately representing the full range of available facilities, particularly those that accept Medicaid <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>. The committee has requested detailed financial and operational information from APFM, including revenue data and the vetting process for facilities <a href="https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/news/sen-casey-calls-out-a-place-for-mom-over-potentially-deceptive-business-practices/">(Bonvissuto, McKnight’s Senior Living, 2024-06-20)</a>.</p>
<h2>Leadership Changes</h2>
<p>Tatyana Zlotsky became the new CEO of A Place for Mom in April 2024. She has emphasized the importance of adapting to the evolving senior living market, stating, “If we don’t change, we become irrelevant” <a href="https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/">(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)</a>.</p>
<h2>Product Innovations</h2>
<p>A Place for Mom has recently launched a program called Family Live Transfer, which connects families directly with senior living communities, aiming to streamline the referral process and improve conversion rates. This initiative has reportedly led to a 75% increase in tours and a 60% increase in conversions compared to previous referral methods <a href="https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/">(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)</a>.</p>
<h2>Quality Concerns</h2>
<p>Despite its prominence, A Place for Mom has faced criticism regarding the quality of the facilities it recommends. A Washington Post analysis found that a significant portion of the communities listed as "Best of Senior Living" had been cited for neglect or substandard care <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>. This has led to calls for greater transparency in how the company operates and the criteria it uses to vet facilities <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Granigan, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>While specific revenue figures for A Place for Mom are not publicly disclosed due to its private ownership, the company has been asked to provide three years' worth of financial data to the Senate committee as part of the ongoing investigation <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-announces-probe-place-for-mom-referral-service-rcna157282">(Kingkade, NBC News, 2024-06-18)</a>.</p>
<h2>Market Position and Competition</h2>
<p>A Place for Mom is the leading player in the senior living referral market, but it faces increasing competition from both new boutique referral services and established senior living operators who are developing their own in-house marketing strategies <a href="https://seniorhousingnews.com/2024/11/18/how-a-place-for-moms-new-ceo-is-evolving-the-companys-relationships-with-operators/">(Regan, Senior Housing News, 2024-11-18)</a>. The scrutiny from lawmakers and media may also impact its reputation and operational model moving forward.</p>
