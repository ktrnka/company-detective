        <h1>About 98point6</h1>
<p>98point6 Technologies, founded on March 1, 2015, is a Seattle-based company that initially launched as a virtual clinic providing on-demand, text-based primary care. Over time, the company has evolved significantly. In 2023, it transitioned to a software licensing model, focusing on building and licensing technology to healthcare organizations after selling its healthcare delivery division to Transcarent <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company offers a cloud-based, AI-powered platform for asynchronous and real-time virtual care, allowing healthcare organizations to provide care without scheduling constraints.

The platform supports integration with electronic health records (EHRs) and other healthcare systems, enhancing workflow and data management. Additionally, 98point6 has expanded its offerings to include behavioral health services, addressing the rise in mental health issues post-COVID-19 <a href="https://www.98point6.com/press_release/acquisition-brightmd-launch-asynchronous-care/">(98point6 Technologies, 2024-01-10)</a>.</p>
<p>98point6 serves over 3 million members through partnerships with more than 300 commercial contracts, including major employers like Boeing and Sam's Club, as well as health systems like Banner|Aetna.

      <p>Waste of money and time. The "doctors" don't help you and just tell you to go to an in person clinic because they can't do an exam. Tried twice for minor issues and they blew me off. If you attempt to advocate for yourself they'll hang up on you. 10/10 do NOT recommend.</p>

      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

I keep trying to get in to get a prescription filled but as soon as I open the app it requests I enter my phone number to request a code which never comes. I've checked and rechecked my number or blocked numbers on my phone and I still can't get past this screen. This is EXTREMELY frustrating!</p>

      <p>The doctors on here are quacks. I would not use this app. I thought the purpose of this was to avoid the hospital or clinics. I came on here to try and get antibiotics. Was told to go to a clinic. I came on here so I wouldn't have to go to a clinic. You won't get anything but the run around with these doctors, so save your self time and go to a clinic and avoid these quacks</p>

      <h4>5 stars (Anita Derbin, Google Play Store, 2024-06-18)</h4>
      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

The virtual assistant didn't understand any of my questions 9th¹1& also ended my session while I was describing my problem, causing me to have to start the intake registration over!

      <p>The first step is to verify your mobile number by entering a code that is texted to you. There is no other option. You're lucky if you get the code within five minutes core before it expires. This is common. Then you get into a queue after an idiotic chatbot asks you a bunch of redundant questions and you wait a long time.

      <p>APP works but doctors are listed but NOT necessarily local. Had poisoning from AZ plant, got a NY dr or nurse practitioner, not sure. Had no idea what my issue was. No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

Then they would issue a perscription. This service was pointless. The entire point of this service is to keep sick people home and out of office. She even told me to go to urgent care. Why when she clearly could have issued the antibiotic that was needed. Great concept poor service</p>

      <p>Wrong. Just wrong. When the heart is hurting, getting further away from the heart causes more harm, not less. When you need telehealth in the middle of the night for an adult dependent, telling me to kindly f-off because they don't have the app installed and connected to my insurance doesn't help. Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist? No, it tells me, you must be suici</p>

      <p>The 98point6 app only has an iPhone version and has not been fully optimized to be used on iPad in landscape orientation. Very frustrating as it is more convenient for me to organize my healthcare through my iPad VS my phone and I would rather have my appointments on my iPad so I can sit at my desk. 

Hopefully there will be an iPad version of this app in the future, when that happens I will most likely change my review to 5 stars as I really have no other issues regarding the service. Being unable to fully support iPad OS is my biggest dealbreaker with apps.</p>

      <p>I began using the service bc I am an emergency response COVID19 RN responding to overwhelmed hospitals across the country so I needed to find an alternative to traditional urgent/ primary care. I only actually received a treatment plan that matched my chief complaint & symptoms on my 1st visit. I was so impressed I purchased a year subscription which I later discovered had been a huge waste of $$ & my time which I have very little of these days. Every time I have attempted to seek treatment for extremely basic/common urgent care illnesses i have ended up having to seek treatment from another company/provider bc the 98point6 providers have refused to actually listen to me or I have been sent for unnecessary laboratory tests that take days to come back and refuse to actually meanwhile I was suffering from a bladder infection that became a kidney infection while waiting for a lab test to tell the provider that it’s okay to give antibiotics!!! I was told to go to the ER for PINK eye and I $$$  for another telehealth provider whom immediately recognized the acute illness provided the proper treatment and I made a full recovery but lost more $$! Every time you  access the app to seek medical treatment the providers will classify every illness you have been treated for in the past as a “chronic” condition and will refuse to treat you and tell you to go seek a health care provider!! Lol I mean I thought that was what I was doing but I guess not! It’s just a waste of time and $$ and you will never be bc able to get a refund on your subscription plan that doesn’t actually exist bc the providers only care about making their $$</p>

      <p>This service makes me miss my old insurances Telehealth so much. The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body. For example as a woman with recurrent UTI’s instead of helping you they make you go see someone in person. I have never experienced this with any other service provider. I have had strep throat and sent pictures in and the provider argued with me that it was not strep and I wouldn’t know and told me to see someone in person. Of course it was. This app is a waste of time, I wish I could get paid to tell someone to go see someone else all day</p>

The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.</p>

      <p>Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. 

Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.

The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.

Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.</p>

After downloading & signing-up for the “98point6” membership, the app was stuck where it required my profile to contain a pharmacy. I searched for support and left 2-messages, at non-human alternatives, unable to start a session because the app doesn’t allow you to progress until your profile contains your pharmacy preference. 4-hours later, miraculously, the app let me choose a pharmacy. From there I submitted my medical issue. The doctor was very kind and supportive but couldn’t help me a bit because not only could she NOT prescribe scheduled medicines by a required tele-visit, she couldn’t submit the prescription to a pharmacy without an approval to submit electronically. I wasted the entire time and effort from the beginning moment I believed this app was a solution. PROCEED WITH CAUTION; READ EVERYTHING; I DID AND SEE WHERE I LANDED?</p>

      <p>The app itself is a pretty good concept, however I feel that perhaps some of the doctors they work with could be better? I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.</p>

I was already tested for Covid-19, but was negative. I still have symptoms that are only getting worse so I know I need to quarantine. Complete waste of money and time. I wish I never used it in the first place. This was the third service I used and again had NO help.

      <p>All they do is recommend over the counter medication- if you want real help - you’ll still have to go into an office for basic antibiotic prescriptions. Update to first review; two days later - I’ve followed her recommendations and used all the OTC products and I’m still sick - zero improvement, some deterioration. I understand some people abuse antibiotics- but this doctor didn’t even talk to me other than to verify my name and birthday. If she had taken the time to speak with me over the zoom, she could have ascertained that I do in fact have a bacterial infection. Instead, she texted a very general, “one size fits all” recommendation. I think it’s a waste of money for business to use this service for their employees. Their doctor told me I had to be sick for at least 10 days for her to consider antibiotics. Update 2, woke up with severe conjunctivitis in my left eye.  I was unable to open it because of hardened puss - a sign of a bacterial infection according to CDC.</p>

      <h4>Great service, response, 5 stars (Saratov, Apple App Store, 2021-02-16)</h4>
      <p>Highly recommend. The doctor was thorough in treating me. A convenient, quick and price effective option for symptoms not requiring an in-person visit. My husband and I have used 98point6 on separate occasions and both have been very pleased.</p>

      <p>Had an allergic reaction and was sent home without an EpiPen. A thorough history was taken and Rx for an EpiPen sent to my pharmacy. Very efficient.</p>

      <p>Complete waste of time.  I entered all of my health history, my rx history, and symptoms, and set up the account, and then after I connected with a provider, was told I would need a lab result for a UTI in order to be treated.  Why does the service list expressly say treatment for a UTI is included????  I don’t have a lab open near me, and the only option is a 5-7 hr wait in my car at our local hospital that is overrun and understaffed.</p>

      <p>This was so easy. Much nicer than going to the physical doctor and a lot easier than zoom.</p>
