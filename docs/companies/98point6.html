        <h1>About 98point6</h1>
<p>98point6, founded on March 1, 2015, is a healthcare technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Initially, the company provided direct-to-consumer telehealth services, offering on-demand, text-based primary care through a mobile app. This service aimed to make healthcare more accessible by allowing patients to connect with board-certified physicians anytime, anywhere <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023, 98point6 sold its care delivery division to Transcarent for approximately $100 million, marking a significant pivot in its business model. The company transitioned to focus on licensing its virtual care technology to healthcare organizations, rebranding as 98point6 Technologies. This shift was accompanied by layoffs, reducing its workforce significantly <a href="https://www.foley.com/people/zaitlin-hannah-e/">(Hannah E. Zaitlin, Foley, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>98point6 Technologies now offers a cloud-based virtual care platform that includes asynchronous and real-time care, AI-powered solutions, and data integration with electronic medical records (EMRs) like Epic and Cerner. The platform is designed to reduce administrative burdens on clinicians and improve patient engagement <a href="https://www.98point6.com/platform/">(98point6 Technologies on 2024-03-08)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has established partnerships with over 240 commercial clients, including major brands like Boeing, Sam’s Club, and Banner|Aetna, serving more than 3 million members <a href="https://www.98point6.com/resource/disclaimers/">(98point6 Technologies on 2023-01-23)</a>. The company's revenue details are not explicitly mentioned, but it has raised a total of $299 million in funding over several rounds <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/98point6">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Acquisition by Transcarent and Business Model Shift</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Transcarent acquired 98point6's care delivery platform, including its AI-driven virtual care technology. This acquisition was part of Transcarent's strategy to enhance its healthcare navigation services for self-insured employers <a href="https://www.foley.com/people/zaitlin-hannah-e/">(Hannah E. Zaitlin, Foley, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, 98point6 shifted to a technology licensing model, focusing on selling its virtual care technology to health systems. This transition led to significant layoffs, reducing the workforce to a "skeleton crew" <a href="https://histalkpractice.com/2025/02/03/news-2-3-25/">(25 – HIStalk Practice, 2025)</a>.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<p>As of early 2025, 98point6 has reportedly ceased its telehealth service, with some clients seeking alternative providers. This raises questions about the viability of 98point6's new direction and its ability to sustain operations in the competitive healthcare technology market <a href="https://histalkpractice.com/2025/02/03/news-2-3-25/">(25 – HIStalk Practice, 2025)</a>.</p>
<h2>Market Position</h2>
<p>98point6 operates in a highly competitive healthcare technology market, facing challenges from established players and new entrants. The company's shift in business model raises concerns about its long-term viability, while its focus on AI and user experience remains crucial for maintaining a competitive edge <a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/article/781279283/virtual-health-service-market-is-booming-worldwide-2025-2032-98point6-babylon-health-evisit-healthtap-mdlive">(Mr. Shah, 2025-01-29)</a>.</p>

      <p>This service is definitively useless. I came asking for help dealing with a Flu and they told me I had to get a chest xray and take several tests to make sure Im not dying from pneumonia. For crying out loud, buying mucinex over the counter did more justice for me than this platform did. They didn't even ask me for pictures or attempt a video call like other services do. No measures were taken to diagnose anything. As useless as paying to go to the doctors office just to fill out the clipboard.</p>

I've used it twice for very simple things(childs ear infection) both times they have done absolutely nothing helpful. Why would I waste my time on this app when the conclusion is telling me to go sit in an urgent care waiting room and spend $70 just to be prescribed antibiotics. Insane waste of time.</p>

      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

Then I waited another hour to see the same doctor and I picked up the call and there was no response. She said she couldn't get it to work so she ended the visit.

When i questioned the “Dr” resolution her response was “this is protocol.”   I understand that however not  trusting your patients comments about history of symptoms doesn’t work.   I suggest that if anyone has a recurring illness such as sinus infections save your time and go straight to a clinic that is not a text message platform.  If you think you may have a sinus infection save your time and go get the mucinex at the drug store and then contact them 14 days later because their protocols will not allow any other care till then.</p>

Second time using this app I was wanting to get antibiotics for my sons ear infection, I looked inside his ear with an otoscope and it was really red. This is not his first ear infection. The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.</p>

Two doctors just suggested OTCs I said I am already using and insist it is viral and does not need antibiotics. Asking what are my symptoms different than bacterial ones? Then they suggest you go to urgent care or office visit. Completely a waist of time and you cannot even cancel subscription before 3month pass!!!!</p>

      <h4>A waste of time, 1 stars (R Haymore, Apple App Store, 2023-07-02)</h4>
      <p>I gave this app 3 tries and all ended in poor outcomes. 1st time I was waiting for an hour or so and never received a notification to meet with a doctor. I gave it another try when my daughter had an eye infection and needed antibiotics. The physician advised to apply ice to her eye and go into the doctors office if it got worse, she would not write a prescription. The third time, my daughter had an allergic reaction in her eye with severe swelling, she needed steroids but the physician refused to write a prescription and advised to use otc meds which we had already tried. We ended up having to go to an urgent care and the physician there wrote a prescription for steroids. If you enjoy wasting your time then this app is for you.</p>

      <h4>Greatly appreciated, 5 stars (Mrs.B@2022, Apple App Store, 2023-09-23)</h4>
      <p>I have tried all day to get my 6 year old son seen today. I could not get him In yesterday and with it being a Saturday today the only places near me where Urgent Cares which we’re wanting $100 upfront even with insurance. I felt defeated because I did not have the money at the time. I saw my insurance offered this app at $0 cost so I tried it. I’m so glad I did it was super quick and easy to use. We had a short video chat but most of it was by text. The doctor was very nice and helpful. She sent in a lot of useful information. He was diagnosed and sent in a prescription to the pharmacy of my choosing. Now my son can get better thanks to this app and the very appreciated doctors. 

It is a great app to use for adults and parents that are unable to drive or that just is having a hard time being seen by someone same day. The have doctors available every day of the week on this app. I’m so lucky to have used it. Thank you 98point6!</p>
