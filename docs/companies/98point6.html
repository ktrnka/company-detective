      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>The doctors on here are quacks. I would not use this app. I thought the purpose of this was to avoid the hospital or clinics. I came on here to try and get antibiotics. Was told to go to a clinic. I came on here so I wouldn't have to go to a clinic. You won't get anything but the run around with these doctors, so save your self time and go to a clinic and avoid these quacks</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

You're lucky if you get the code within five minutes core before it expires. This is common. Then you get into a queue after an idiotic chatbot asks you a bunch of redundant questions and you wait a long time.

No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

Then they would issue a perscription. This service was pointless. The entire point of this service is to keep sick people home and out of office. She even told me to go to urgent care. Why when she clearly could have issued the antibiotic that was needed. Great concept poor service</p>

      <p>Wrong. Just wrong. When the heart is hurting, getting further away from the heart causes more harm, not less. When you need telehealth in the middle of the night for an adult dependent, telling me to kindly f-off because they don't have the app installed and connected to my insurance doesn't help. Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist? No, it tells me, you must be suici</p>

      <p>Nothing changes from the previous one. If you need antibiotics for anything infectious, in my case sinus infection with fever and ear pain, don’t waste your time here. Two doctors just suggested OTCs I said I am already using and insist it is viral and does not need antibiotics. Asking what are my symptoms different than bacterial ones? Then they suggest you go to urgent care or office visit. Completely a waist of time and you cannot even cancel subscription before 3month pass!!!!</p>

      <p>The 98point6 app only has an iPhone version and has not been fully optimized to be used on iPad in landscape orientation. Very frustrating as it is more convenient for me to organize my healthcare through my iPad VS my phone and I would rather have my appointments on my iPad so I can sit at my desk. 

Hopefully there will be an iPad version of this app in the future, when that happens I will most likely change my review to 5 stars as I really have no other issues regarding the service. Being unable to fully support iPad OS is my biggest dealbreaker with apps.</p>

      <p>Doctor said she required labs for something I’ve been treated for before without needing labs and since it was a Friday evening, there wasn’t anything she could do so I should go to a walk in clinic. I was charged to be told to go somewhere else. Won’t be using this again. I’d rather pay teledoc for an out of network visit then to waste time here again.</p>

      <p>Great service! There was a 30 minute wait, so they just messaged me when the doctor was ready. I had a problem with my inner ear, so she explained to me what may be taking place, and sent a prescription over to my pharmacy. This was much better than making an appointment with a doctors office.</p>

      <h4>Getting worse over time, 1 stars (Jentropy, Apple App Store, 2022-06-26)</h4>
      <p>My partner has used this for a few years now as primary care for a well managed chronic condition because he’s uninsured and we’re poor but don’t qualify for Medicaid. 

At first it was great. Even though he gets a new provider at every visit, they’re typically decent enough and he’s been able to avoid hospital visits and complications of his conditions. 

Lately, though, the care has been sub-par. He gets shamed by the doctors for not having a doctor to see in person, even though his condition is well managed and he’s told them he can’t afford any other care. We pay out of pocket for routine labs and do everything they ask, but each appointment makes him feel worse than the last. They also act like they’re going to cut him off and stop treating him any day now, which would likely trigger permanent harm and complications due to lack of access to his maintenance meds, which are safe and he’s been using for many years. 

It’s time to start shopping around for a new telemedicine service.</p>

We don't need you to tell us about over-the-counter drugs, we know that stuff we are grown adults we know our bodies were not calling for pain, meds or drugs. We just want some relief which is antibiotics and you don't ever do that for anybody we are forced to use.you  with no relief or help. People work they can't wait 10 days, especially when they've been in bed for five. This is a waste of time and I hope Costco pulls their account from you guys.</p>
