      <p>This service is definitively useless. I came asking for help dealing with a Flu and they told me I had to get a chest xray and take several tests to make sure Im not dying from pneumonia. For crying out loud, buying mucinex over the counter did more justice for me than this platform did. They didn't even ask me for pictures or attempt a video call like other services do. No measures were taken to diagnose anything. As useless as paying to go to the doctors office just to fill out the clipboard.</p>

      <p>The absolute worst of the worst. You pay for someone to tell u to drink water and take ibuprofen. They won't prescribe you anything. I tried recently to get a script for DoxyPEP. Nope. Can't prescribe it. Why? I don't know. It seems like that would be the perfect thing this app would be useful for. Don't waste your time, this app is garbage.</p>

      <p>The purpose of telehealth is to provide care virtually. The doctors on the app are not helpful. I've used it twice for very simple things(childs ear infection) both times they have done absolutely nothing helpful. Why would I waste my time on this app when the conclusion is telling me to go sit in an urgent care waiting room and spend $70 just to be prescribed antibiotics. Insane waste of time.</p>

      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

When you need telehealth in the middle of the night for an adult dependent, telling me to kindly f-off because they don't have the app installed and connected to my insurance doesn't help. Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist? No, it tells me, you must be suici</p>

      <h4>Poor customer service, 1 stars (Jdubz8910, Apple App Store, 2023-12-23)</h4>
      <p>You have no email address for customer satisfaction. It is evident that this service lacks a customer-centric approach, as there are no available options to express concerns or provide feedback. This lack of consideration for customer satisfaction is disappointing and raises questions about the service's commitment to improving and addressing customer needs. I hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and implements a system that allows customers to express their concerns and provide feedback in the future.

Over the past week, my children have been home sick from school, and we have been cautious about having any visitors. Unfortunately, I have been experiencing symptoms that lead me to suspect I may have contracted strep throat, although I cannot be entirely certain. In an attempt to seek medical advice conveniently, I decided to utilize the 98.6 app, a service provided by our employer. Previously, we had been using Teldoc for the past 20 years, but our employer recently switched to 98.6, which has proven to be an inconvenience and a waste of time, with no added convenience.

During my recent interaction with the 98.6 app, I had the opportunity to consult with the FNP-BC, a Nurse Practitioner based in New York, NY. As a provider responsible for handling calls from subscribed employees, it is crucial that her professionalism and respect reflect the value of the service that employers pay for. The purpose of this service is to provide employees with prompt and convenient care, and it is essential that her behavior aligns with this objective.

Unfortunately, my experience with Nurse  was far from satisfactory. After expressing a differing opinion, she abruptly terminated the visit, displaying a lack of professionalism and cowardice. It is concerning to think that someone with such behavior is responsible for caring for patients. I strongly urge you to review her patient transcripts for overall patient satisfaction and consider the impact her actions may have on the reputation of the service.</p>

      <p>The app itself is a pretty good concept, however I feel that perhaps some of the doctors they work with could be better? I used the app for the first time today, answered the pre-“visit” questions (not bad there), and then when my virtual doctor joined, it was more or less the doctor messaging the entire time, not letting me really get a word in, and trying to push things on me without me getting to tell him what I was looking for as an end result. I told the doctor my issue and asked if it were possible for a script (nothing with painkillers or anything they aren’t allowed to prescribe), to which the doctor essentially ignored me and recommended things I have been doing to no avail throughout being sick. I informed the doctor that his advice was not something that was working, however I would give one of his solutions a try (it was clear he had no interest in helping me, as my primary care would have) and wrapped up the conversation asap. Again, I like the concept of this app; I think it’s a great idea…just not so much the staff that partners with the app. It all felt impersonal and like a quick cash grab.</p>

      <h4>This app is a joke, 1 stars (B-Riches, Apple App Store, 2023-04-21)</h4>
      <p>My company pays for this app, every doctor I have ever seen pretty much just tells you to sleep it off and/ or prescribes over the counter meds, they pretty much state in the terms before you are seen that they pretty much refuse to prescribe antibiotics or anything that actually treats your symptoms. Also, from my experience the physicians are not well qualified and don’t take your symptoms into consideration whatsoever. For example: I have had a sore throat for almost 2 weeks now and can never get to the doctors office because they work the same hours I do… I told the doctor my symptoms and told him that I have been taking antihistamines and nasal spray that have been working but my throat is still killing me; he proceeded to prescribe me the same antihistamines and nasal spray that I had already been taking none of which would help my throat whatsoever… It also takes a good 30-45 minutes to finish your appointment because it’s ALL texting. Long story short, Doctor On Demand is the way to go if you want a doctor who will actually take you seriously and respect your time.</p>

      <p>I felt like I got cheated out of paying for nothing and getting not what I had expected. I spoke to the doctor in the evening and they diagnosed me with something and asked me to check again in the morning. I did that and the doctor in the morning diagnosed me with something else and told me I needed to see a doctor in person. I just felt like I should’ve used the time and money to go see urgent care in the first place vs. paying double.</p>

The app was stuck in “sending” for an uncomfortable length of time.

The service is helpful overall - just needs these things fixed.</p>

      <p>Just had a visit but was a huge waste of time. Just wanted prescription refills but they could not do one of them and would not do the other without lab work even though I just had lab work 5 months ago. Took a lot of time to answer all the questions and set up a profile for nothing. Might as well just find a local doctor.</p>
