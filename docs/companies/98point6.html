<p>98point6 is a Seattle-based company founded in March 2015, specializing in digital healthcare solutions. Initially launched as a virtual clinic providing on-demand, text-based primary care, the company has since transitioned to a software licensing model.

<p>The company offers a virtual care platform that includes asynchronous and real-time care, leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance patient interactions and streamline administrative tasks.

<h2>Layoffs and Restructuring</h2>

      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day. GOD SENT! ❤️</p>

You're lucky if you get the code within five minutes core before it expires. This is common.

No results only a wasted text/time. 1 min video and texting the rest of the "visit". Not sure this is real medical care. It's text care??!!?? Not impressed at all. At least it was 0$ as it wasn't worth a penny. Sorry. Lame telemedicine. But app works. Asks huge amt of questions and took 2 weeks to be registered correctly. Pftt!</p>

Then they would issue a perscription. This service was pointless. The entire point of this service is to keep sick people home and out of office. She even told me to go to urgent care. Why when she clearly could have issued the antibiotic that was needed. Great concept poor service</p>

      <p>Wrong. Just wrong. When the heart is hurting, getting further away from the heart causes more harm, not less. When you need telehealth in the middle of the night for an adult dependent, telling me to kindly f-off because they don't have the app installed and connected to my insurance doesn't help. Misunderstanding and misdiagnosis of the real problems has been my experience. Heart attack? No, it tells me, it's just stress. Looking for a mental health therapist?

      <p>Nothing changes from the previous one. If you need antibiotics for anything infectious, in my case sinus infection with fever and ear pain, don’t waste your time here. Two doctors just suggested OTCs I said I am already using and insist it is viral and does not need antibiotics. Asking what are my symptoms different than bacterial ones? Then they suggest you go to urgent care or office visit. Completely a waist of time and you cannot even cancel subscription before 3month pass!!!!</p>

      <h4>Do not recommend!!!!, 1 stars (bobbyemc, Apple App Store, 2021-05-03)</h4>
      <p>Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! 

So This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.</p>

      <p>I understand with antibiotics the doctors follow strict guidelines, however it’s really interesting when a doctor sends you the guidelines to explain why he won’t give antibiotics for a sinus infection to a person with a weakened immune system for 10 day even though according to the guidelines in my situation it says 3-4 days and it’s been 3. This is after the first doctor brushed me off as a cold. Every time I use this app I’m directed to urgent care, what’s the point of even using it then?</p>

      <p>This app is offered through my insurance for free. Which is helpful since I don’t get a copay option to visit any primary care physician. Let me just say that this is where technology draws the line - getting healthcare over text (which is their primary communication method) seems ineffective. For a start, the amount of intake questions they ask you before you’re connected to an actual provider is insane. I quit the app on multiple occasions because I was annoyed at answering the questions. Another thing is there are limited situations that would warrant discussing a medical issue over text. You might be ok with a very mild issue like a cold or season allergies but even then you would typically just get something over the counter from a store. I would only recommend this as a resource to get general questions answered about health, not to receive treatment.</p>

      <p>Got this app for a quick prescription for a yeast infection without urgent care fees or time spent on an appointment. Tried 3 different docs. All of them told me to see someone in person or get labs done first??? I’m a female I know what a yeast infection feels like. Honestly this app is just an advertisement for LabCorp/Quest who they’re obviously partnered with because they tried to make me pay for labs or appointments with them every time. I found other apps who will write a simple antifungal rx without forcing labs and appointments down my throat (WHICH NEGATES THE PURPOSE OF MOBILE CARE). Don’t waste your money on this scam.</p>

      <p>The 98point6 app only has an iPhone version and has not been fully optimized to be used on iPad in landscape orientation. Very frustrating as it is more convenient for me to organize my healthcare through my iPad VS my phone and I would rather have my appointments on my iPad so I can sit at my desk. 

Hopefully there will be an iPad version of this app in the future, when that happens I will most likely change my review to 5 stars as I really have no other issues regarding the service. Being unable to fully support iPad OS is my biggest dealbreaker with apps.</p>

When i questioned the “Dr” resolution her response was “this is protocol.”   I understand that however not  trusting your patients comments about history of symptoms doesn’t work.   I suggest that if anyone has a recurring illness such as sinus infections save your time and go straight to a clinic that is not a text message platform.  If you think you may have a sinus infection save your time and go get the mucinex at the drug store and then contact them 14 days later because their protocols will not allow any other care till then.</p>

I was already tested for Covid-19, but was negative. I still have symptoms that are only getting worse so I know I need to quarantine. Complete waste of money and time. I wish I never used it in the first place. This was the third service I used and again had NO help. All I needed was a note so I prevent spreading any illness and to be covered at work, now I’m out of options and I’ll probably lose my job.

      <h4>Dr visit, 5 stars (sonicb53, Apple App Store, 2021-07-08)</h4>
      <p>The doctor was very nice. She answered all of my questions. She didn’t treat me as if I was an inconvenience too her. She saved me a trip too the doctors office too pick up the meds. I am very appreciative of this service because we all know that getting sick doesn’t stay in the tie frame of 8-5 Monday thru Friday</p>
