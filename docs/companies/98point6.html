      <p>Updated: This service has become worse. I stopped using it but went back for constipation. I was asked no follow-up questions and was immediately told to go to my PCP or urgent care for x-rays to rule out serious conditions first. What? Tried asking about over the counter stuff, but kept being told to seek in person care. Made to feel like I was wasting the Dr's time. Original: What's the point of the service if the best plan is always seeking in-person care?</p>

      <p>This service is definitively useless. I came asking for help dealing with a Flu and they told me I had to get a chest xray and take several tests to make sure Im not dying from pneumonia. For crying out loud, buying mucinex over the counter did more justice for me than this platform did. They didn't even ask me for pictures or attempt a video call like other services do. No measures were taken to diagnose anything. As useless as paying to go to the doctors office just to fill out the clipboard.</p>

      <p>The purpose of telehealth is to provide care virtually. The doctors on the app are not helpful. I've used it twice for very simple things(childs ear infection) both times they have done absolutely nothing helpful. Why would I waste my time on this app when the conclusion is telling me to go sit in an urgent care waiting room and spend $70 just to be prescribed antibiotics. Insane waste of time.</p>

      <p>Doctors don't care. But if you're looking for a super easy doctors note to get out of work or you will be tardy use this app. Mind you your mychart now has virtual urgent care and you actually video chat with a doctor on mychart virtual urgent care. 98point6 they only text you. They won't back track a doctors note for you. But mychart will gladly write your note to be excused for the day before especially if you can't make it in the day you are actually sick and can only visit the next day</p>

      <p>I am so grateful my husband's job offers this as a benefit. We have two little kids who, as well known, tend to get sick pretty often. On our area, it is nearly impossible to get the same day appointment with the doctor. Plus, daycare requires doctors note if we wanted to get a partial refund on the tuition for missing days - this app allows us (at no cost since it is offered as a benefit) from the comfort of our home get in touch with a doctor at any time of the day.

      <p>Honestly Ive used the app for a year now and it has become a waste of time. My company provides this for us, but the only answer I ever recieve is "you will have to go to an in person doctor to get that resolved". Whether it be a flu or a uti or whatever. Going to suggest my company stop using it.</p>

When i questioned the “Dr” resolution her response was “this is protocol.”   I understand that however not  trusting your patients comments about history of symptoms doesn’t work.   I suggest that if anyone has a recurring illness such as sinus infections save your time and go straight to a clinic that is not a text message platform.  If you think you may have a sinus infection save your time and go get the mucinex at the drug store and then contact them 14 days later because their protocols will not allow any other care till then.</p>

The service providers always direct you to go be seen in person, they never listen to your past and your history and treat you like a child not an adult, when you know your body. For example as a woman with recurrent UTI’s instead of helping you they make you go see someone in person. I have never experienced this with any other service provider.

They will tell you do salt water gargles or take over the counter medications which most of the people already tried before they go to a doctor. So what is the point of wasting your time on this app. It is better to go to urgent care and get antibiotics to help in your throat.I will never use this app again.</p>

Second time using this app I was wanting to get antibiotics for my sons ear infection, I looked inside his ear with an otoscope and it was really red. This is not his first ear infection. The dr said to get him tested for covid. What?! He had an ear at infection not covid. He has really bad allergies that causes fluid in his ears. Well it caused an ear infection in his left ear. The dr said it is probably a cold causing the redness in the ear and will go away in a few days. I told her no it’s an ear infection and he needs antibiotics . She wouldn’t help. I took him to his pediatrician she confirmed the ear infection and prescribed antibiotics. I was hoping the app would of been useful but it’s a joke along with the crappy drs.</p>

      <h4>Do not recommend!!!!, 1 stars (bobbyemc, Apple App Store, 2021-05-03)</h4>
      <p>Our insurance signed my family up for this during the pandemic. The first two visits were really good.  I would have highly recommended. Then the last two visits happened. I not only will no longer use this but I’m going share with everyone I know not to use! Both visits all the Doctors cared about was COVID and pushing the COVID vaccination. We understand being concerned with COVID but not everything is COVID! And when they are told you already tested negative and they continue only talking about COVID. That’s unacceptable! Also no vaccination is supposed to be given to anyone who is sick. Adults, children, infants, the elderly.  It doesn’t matter and a medical doctor SHOULD KNOW THIS! They did nothing to help at either visit. And we mean nothing! They didn’t listen to any of the list of things that you answer before logging in. Anything said while chatting. Neither Doctor ever got on the video chat like they are supposed to do. Oh and the wait times were way longer then estimated. So if you want no help, to waste your money, and to waste an hour or more off your day then this is perfect! Seems like a great idea to get seen without going to a hospital, urgent care ,etc. or your primary can’t get you in and you don’t have to risk catching something else. BUT they do nothing to actually treat you. After both visits we had the family members taken to our local urgent care and both times they needed medical treatment and or medication.  Medication that should have and could have been given through the doctors on this app. Also 98.6 sends you emails asking how you’re visit went. Both times the surveys were answered with the truth and how bad the service was. Do you think we heard anything back? NOPE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! 

So This review is being written and we hope that it will be a cautionary tale about this app and what to expect.</p>

      <h4>Getting worse over time, 1 stars (Jentropy, Apple App Store, 2022-06-26)</h4>
      <p>My partner has used this for a few years now as primary care for a well managed chronic condition because he’s uninsured and we’re poor but don’t qualify for Medicaid. 

At first it was great. Even though he gets a new provider at every visit, they’re typically decent enough and he’s been able to avoid hospital visits and complications of his conditions. 

Lately, though, the care has been sub-par. He gets shamed by the doctors for not having a doctor to see in person, even though his condition is well managed and he’s told them he can’t afford any other care. We pay out of pocket for routine labs and do everything they ask, but each appointment makes him feel worse than the last. They also act like they’re going to cut him off and stop treating him any day now, which would likely trigger permanent harm and complications due to lack of access to his maintenance meds, which are safe and he’s been using for many years. 

It’s time to start shopping around for a new telemedicine service.</p>

      <p>Both my wife and I have tried this app and the result is the same. You have to answer a ton of questions then you get a warning that they rarely give prescriptions which turned out to be true. 

Basically the doctor gives you the “I’m sorry you feel bad. Just wait it out.” I get that some Doctors just hand out prescriptions to everyone and they certainly don’t want to be the online pharmacy, but with the warning before you even meet the Dr you get a sense they’ll take your insurance company’s money, but not any risk to actually treat someone.

The advantage to the Doctors is that they never get a personal review because the Doctor who will diagnose you will be chosen by the app.

Anyway if you want a Doctor’s sympathy this is the app for you.</p>

      <p>This was the first time I used this app for any medical care and was pleasantly surprised. I was fortunate enough to reach Dr Kharat. She was was kind and understanding. She took her time and evaluating my situation, explained the treatment plan and gave excellent support!</p>

      <p>Would rather talk to someone than texting back and forth . A doctor can see the patient in real time and have a better understanding. Not sure what you get from a text conversation</p>

      <h4>Waste of Time and Money, 1 stars (kitty kibbles, Apple App Store, 2021-07-19)</h4>
      <p>The doctor’s on this service are extremely condescending. They also apparently can only treat any illnesses or infections once, so you’re paying $120 a year plus a $1 a visit to receive absolutely no help. My most recent visit, I wasn’t even looking for a prescription or treatment. I sent details and pictures of the area of concern and all I wanted was advice on whether or not I needed to be seen in person. The doctor rudely told me that he couldn’t help because I was treated for the same thing 7 months ago. He said to continue to do the things I was already doing to treat the problem. No other advice given. Turns out I have a massive infection in my lymph node and needed to be out on antibiotics immediately. No testing done at urgent care, I was simply diagnosed by my symptoms and the doctor looking at the are. Same I provided to the DR in this service. What is the point of this service if they can’t actually treat or diagnose you.</p>

      <p>Providers admit that they are limited in what they can do in the virtual environment and, after a long process and wait time, just refer you out to an in person provider. Skip this process and just go to the in person provider. This does not save you any time or energy.</p>

      <h4>Super easy 24 access to a real doctor, 5 stars (DSCoder, Apple App Store, 2021-11-30)</h4>
      <p>I am grateful that the nurse on call suggested I could try this app as a way to see a doctor within the next 24 hours
Without the app I wouldn’t have been able to follow through on her recommendation.
Getting signed up was very easy and it is covered by my health insurance.
I’m considering staying with this health insurance during open enrollment
Because I really like this service</p>
