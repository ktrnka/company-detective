<h2>PRODUCT Labelbox</h2>
<h3>Usability and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Labelbox -----easy and clear to upload. Once I sign in, I can start to upload your own data and it shows how many images have been added and easily to complete uploading." (debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)</li>
<li>"Labelbox ... is less convenient than dLabel as you need to go to the editorâ€™s page and edit or add more annotation objects." (debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)</li>
<li>"I personally find the layout too simple. There are not many features. So There is nothing much to say." (debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaboration and Annotation Quality</h3>
