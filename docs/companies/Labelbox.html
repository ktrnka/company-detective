        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Company Labelbox</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Labelbox is great for larger projects with multiple kinds of annotations used." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vze1hj/d_what_are_people_using_to_organize_large_groups/ig8lhy0/">(Morteriag, Reddit, 2022-07-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Company Labelbox</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I wouldn't go down this path again. Most of their features, like majority voting, calculating scores for annotators, commenting images etc. don't work properly if you have a custom UI." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vze1hj/d_what_are_people_using_to_organize_large_groups/ig95gzi/">(cygn, Reddit, 2022-07-15)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Product Labelbox</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I personally find the layout too simple. There are not many features. So there is nothing much to say." (debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)</li>
<li>"However, it is less convenient than dLabel as you need to go to the editor’s page and edit or add more annotation objects." (debbydai, Reddit, 2020-10-28)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Job Application Experience</h2>
<h3>Company Labelbox</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Comparisons with Other Tools</h2>
<h3>Product Labelbox</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I wanted to recommend Roboflow because I think their tooling is quite good, I did some pet projects with them a few years back. But today's pricing of $249/month for a non-public dataset seems horroristic for me. I used label studio for text annotation only, it was quite good, nothing super fancy though." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kywmqom/">(mrdanibudapest, Reddit, 2024-04-10)</a></li>
<li>"Instead going for roboflow, the easiest and better bet would be using label studio in aws marketplace. Quiet efficient." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/lomr27m/">(learnlogik, Reddit, 2024-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Label studio (free version) is the way to go. OP trust me I went on a similar search a few months back and after bouncing around a few options decided that Label Studio is the way to go. The pricing on the paid tools like CVAT, Roboflow and cousins is insane and honestly its something that a good programmer can easily build on their own quite quickly now with GPT4." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1c047cd/labeling_tool_free_vs_paid_version_any/kyzqp42/">(acertainmoment, Reddit, 2024-04-10)</a></li>
