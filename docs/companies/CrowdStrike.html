<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Having 200,000 agents running for seven years, I can't say I agree with that sentiment. When it comes to system stability investigations, CS has always been top notch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/18886ac/bsod_caused_by_csagentsys/kbn53c7/">(Kaldek, Reddit, 2023-12-02)</a></li>
<li>"We have run the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete on 4500 hosts for 3.5 years and are very happy with the service. ... In the last 3+ years they have stopped 2 ransomware attacks and remediated other significant infections with very little effort on our side, if any. Their incident response team is great and have been helpful with information and assistance on incidents that weren't related to endpoints/crowdstrike. Support is amazing. I couldn't recommend them any higher." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksqk8sc/">(OK_SmellYaLater, Reddit, 2024-02-29)</a></li>

My biggest problem with MS Defender is that it relies on signature files, and you have to rely on MS analysts to review blocked files to create exclusions." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksrb8gk/">(No_Returns1976, Reddit, 2024-02-29)</a></li>
