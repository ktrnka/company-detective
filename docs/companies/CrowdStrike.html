<h2>Major Outage Incident (July 2024)</h2>
<p>On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike experienced a significant outage due to a faulty software update to its Falcon Sensor, affecting approximately 8.5 million Windows devices globally. This incident caused widespread disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, healthcare, and financial services <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages">(Wikipedia, 2024-07-19)</a>. The outage led to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grounded flights and thousands of cancellations for major airlines like Delta and United <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Explaining-the-largest-IT-outage-in-history-and-whats-next">(TechTarget, 2024-10-29)</a>.</li>
