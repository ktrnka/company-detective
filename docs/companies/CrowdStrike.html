        <h1>About CrowdStrike</h1>
<p>CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a prominent American cybersecurity technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas. It was founded on January 1, 2011, by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crowdstrike">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. The company specializes in endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. CrowdStrike gained significant attention for its role in high-profile cyber investigations, such as the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2016 Democratic National Committee cyberattacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>.</p>
<p>As of 2024, CrowdStrike reported a total revenue of $3.06 billion, reflecting a 36% increase year-over-year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>. The company serves approximately 29,000 enterprise clients across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and government <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/dont-fall-for-it-hackers-pounce-on-crowdstrike-outage-with-phishing-emails">(PCMag, 2024-07-19)</a>. CrowdStrike's business model is primarily B2B, offering advanced cybersecurity solutions to enterprises of all sizes.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike's flagship product is the Falcon platform, a cloud-native cybersecurity solution designed to protect endpoints and cloud workloads. The platform leverages advanced AI and real-time threat intelligence to provide accurate detections, automated protection, and elite threat hunting capabilities <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/news/">(NEWSROOM, 2024-12-10)</a>. The company's products are distributed through direct sales and partnerships with other technology providers.</p>
<p>Over the years, CrowdStrike has expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions, including Preempt Security, Humio, Bionic.ai, and Flow Security, to enhance its zero trust, log management, and cloud security offerings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>George Kurtz is the CEO of CrowdStrike and has played a crucial role in the company's growth and strategic direction. He has been instrumental in navigating the company through challenges, such as the global IT outage in July 2024, and maintaining customer trust <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-retains-customers/734203/">(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024-11-27)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Incidents and Challenges</h2>
<h3>Global IT Outage</h3>
<p>On July 19, 2024, a faulty update to the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software led to a significant global IT outage, affecting approximately 8.5 million Windows devices. This incident caused disruptions across various industries, including healthcare, banking, and air travel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201803/crowdstrike-microsoft-it-global-outage-airlines-banking">(The Verge, 2024-07-19)</a>. The update, intended to enhance security, instead triggered a logic error resulting in blue screens of death (BSOD) on affected systems <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>.</p>
<p>The financial impact of the outage was substantial, costing Fortune 500 companies an estimated $5.4 billion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>. Despite the incident, CrowdStrike maintained a gross retention rate of over 97% in Q3 fiscal 2025, indicating strong customer loyalty <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-retains-customers/734203/">(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024-11-27)</a>.</p>
<h3>Recovery and Market Performance</h3>
<p>Following the IT outage, CrowdStrike's stock price fell significantly but has since recovered. By January 2025, the company had regained the $30 billion in market value lost after the crisis <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cybersecurity/2025/crowdstrike-claws-back-30-billion-lost-to-mass-tech-outage/">(PYMNTS, 2025-01-05)</a>. This recovery underscores the resilience of CrowdStrike's business model and its ability to retain customer trust.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions and Partnerships</h2>
<p>CrowdStrike has been active in expanding its capabilities through acquisitions. Notable acquisitions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preempt Security</strong> (September 2020) for $96 million, enhancing zero trust and conditional access technology.</li>
<li><strong>Humio</strong> (February 2021) for $400 million, aimed at integrating log management into its offerings.</li>
<li><strong>Bionic.ai</strong> (2023) and <strong>Flow Security</strong> (2024) for $200 million and $300 million, respectively, to bolster its cloud security capabilities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike">(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>CrowdStrike achieved FedRAMP authorization for new modules to secure highly regulated industries in the cloud <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250108688972/en/CrowdStrike-Achieves-FedRAMP-Authorization-for-New-Modules-to-Secure-Highly-Regulated-Industries-in-the-Cloud">(Business Wire, 2025-01-08)</a>.</li>
<li>The company warned of a phishing scam targeting job seekers with XMRig Cryptominer <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/crowdstrike-warns-of-phishing-scam.html">(Ravie Lakshmanan, 2025-01-09)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>CrowdStrike continues to be a key player in the cybersecurity landscape, with a strong focus on innovation and strategic growth through acquisitions and partnerships.
