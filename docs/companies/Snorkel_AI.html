<li>"Payments are delayed, bonuses denied after the work is done. And the woman who is responsible is rude and unfair." (Wave_Wake_1993, Reddit, 2025-02-13)</li>

<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I thought it was a scam when they called me, but I did a bunch of question reviews and just got my first paycheck from them. Pretty easy work and decent money for reviewing questions in the subject my PhD is in." (devotionanddoubt, Reddit, 2024-11-23)</li>
<li>"This is exactly what I did for them! I actually ended up reviewing questions instead of writing them. They had some bonus pricing for my field over Thanksgiving and I ended up making a pretty good amount of money from them in about a week." (devotionanddoubt, Reddit, 2024-12-23)</li>
<li>"Snorkel AI has been a legitimate and rewarding experience for me, the best AI remote job so far. I work in the Bioengineering and Biomedical question/review section, and it's both fulfilling and enjoyable." (KitchenFloor5222, Reddit, 2025-01-08)</li>

<h2>Product Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
