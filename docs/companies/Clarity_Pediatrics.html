        <h1>About Clarity Pediatrics</h1>
<p>Clarity Pediatrics is a telehealth service specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for children and teens aged 5 to 17. The company was founded on November 1, 2021, and operates primarily in California and Texas, providing virtual care without waitlists and accepting insurance <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clarity-pediatrics">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. Clarity Pediatrics aims to ensure that children with ADHD can thrive by offering accessible and affordable care, addressing the needs of approximately 10% of American children diagnosed with this condition.</p>
<p>The company operates as a platform connecting users with independent medical practitioners, rather than functioning as a traditional medical group or healthcare provider. This model allows Clarity Pediatrics to maintain a broad network of healthcare providers across the United States, although its services are limited to states where they are authorized to operate <a href="https://www.claritypediatrics.com/privacy-policy">(Clarity Pediatrics, Privacy Policy, April 2024)</a>.</p>

Its services are distributed through virtual consultations, making it a scalable model within the U.S. market <a href="https://www.claritypediatrics.com/programs-overview">(Clarity Pediatrics Programs Overview, October 2024)</a>.</p>

This funding supports the company's mission to reimagine pediatric chronic care, starting with ADHD, by building a tech-enabled virtual clinic backed by scientific research <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clarity-pediatrics">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
