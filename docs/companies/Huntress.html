      <p>I've been playing this game for... Half a year now. It's very F2P friendly in the beginning, but of course you'll hit that wall eventually. That being said, if you can strike a good balance between spending a few bucks at least on the monthly passes like other online games, you can make decent weekly progress. The art's great, and of course the girls are what I originally came for, but... The game's gotten me through some rough spots, so... I'm attached to it and enjoying grinding away //</p>

      <p>So they've not only made it beyond difficult for any f2p, they really cranked the fomo with huntresses that they take away ability to obtain. Which means if you started but haven't maxed their stars, too bad now you never will. Oh, and they took all the stuff from Destiny Girl, the SEA game, and threw out the fair parts and closed that game. Which also means loss of that better artwork forever. Beyond irritated.

      <p>The new UR system requires such an absurd time commitment or monetary donation...just stick to gacha games where you can actually feel like you've "completed" a character. This one just goes on forever with nothing really happening. See yall in Wuthering Waves. (For those interested in gameplay it's just a team build/positioning game with autobattle)</p>

      <p>It's fun and looks nice but just to time consuming. Only x2 battles and can't skip passed when there are 40 stages to a chapter, arena, and everything else. If they added a skip function it would easily get a 5 star imo</p>

      <p>You get 2 minutes at most for an unskippable tutorial, if I'm still being strung along after that, the next button I'm forced to tap is "uninstall". Your trash gacha game is a dime a dozen in a sea of identical clones, you're introducing nothing new, you don't need a tutorial. Get over yourselves.</p>

      <p>From 5 to 1 star, this game separates servers so all the money I've spent is wasted on a dead and empty server also I accidentally changed server and when I tried to get back on my own one I had to go through almost 5 hours of starter tutorials to find what server I was on because you cannot check without doing the tutorial over and over again I even emailed the Devs, they were not helpful, never even responded</p>

      <p>I've played this game on and off for I think four years? In that time I haven't soent much more than $20 total and I have lots of good players. The skill creep makes it so you slow down progress fir a long time and really have to be persistant to progress. Thats why I always end up taking a break.</p>
