      <p>Very easy idle game. Don't have to spent alot of time to grind. No stamina usage cap (which is nice),just go until you cant. The only personal OCD issue I have is the very minimal increased censorship compared to the (I'm assuming) Japanese version. Just kinda makes it feel like you're not getting the same game. Other than that, definitely 5 stars from me.</p>

      <p>Wrote in the pass about this game gets to a point that even though it's a free game, you'll end up having to pay just to win a match. You lvl, max fighting, gear, ect can be so much stronger than the rpg and you still will lose. Then it says to spend money to get better stuff. Came back to this game to see if it was just sucking at this game, but nope. A lot of people have complained about the same thing</p>

      <p>I've been playing this game for... Half a year now. It's very F2P friendly in the beginning, but of course you'll hit that wall eventually. That being said, if you can strike a good balance between spending a few bucks at least on the monthly passes like other online games, you can make decent weekly progress. The art's great, and of course the girls are what I originally came for, but... The game's gotten me through some rough spots, so... I'm attached to it and enjoying grinding away //</p>

I've been playing a couple of years now, and I really like this game, despite it being way too graindy at times, way too many different layers of power down to the characters. And having way too many paywalls for everything. The one thing that's keeping me around is the characters. Problem is I used to be able to play this game for hours. Now it crashes over 50 times before I can finish my dailies... Please help. 😭</p>

      <p>So they've not only made it beyond difficult for any f2p, they really cranked the fomo with huntresses that they take away ability to obtain. Which means if you started but haven't maxed their stars, too bad now you never will. Oh, and they took all the stuff from Destiny Girl, the SEA game, and threw out the fair parts and closed that game. Which also means loss of that better artwork forever. Beyond irritated. Has gone from my fav to barely playing anymore def will not spend anything.</p>

      <p>Not bad so far except I can't spend any money. I refuse to save my card in Any kind of google wallet and the app doesn't have its own system for accepting payments so looks like I'll be a free player only,and that will lead to nowhere fast. That being said, it's very similar to idle angels. Also, much like idle angels your connection has to be PERFECT. It's forever buffering and makes me sign in again every few minutes. None of the other games on my phone have this issue.</p>

      <p>The new UR system requires such an absurd time commitment or monetary donation...just stick to gacha games where you can actually feel like you've "completed" a character. This one just goes on forever with nothing really happening. See yall in Wuthering Waves. (For those interested in gameplay it's just a team build/positioning game with autobattle)</p>

      <p>From 5 to 1 star, this game separates servers so all the money I've spent is wasted on a dead and empty server also I accidentally changed server and when I tried to get back on my own one I had to go through almost 5 hours of starter tutorials to find what server I was on because you cannot check without doing the tutorial over and over again I even emailed the Devs, they were not helpful, never even responded</p>
