        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>General Impressions</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love it so far. Makes note writing much faster and allows me to avoid typing during the visit while still remembering the details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k2816ai/">(subneil, Reddit, 2023-09-26)</a></li>
<li>"Kaiser just did an extremely successful trial of Nabla, which is LLM based." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/le1xna9/">(prescod, Reddit, 2024-07-20)</a></li>
<li>"In my experience, one key area where these models can be quite valuable is in clinical note summarization." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/lihac16/">(Founder-Awesome, Reddit, 2024-08-16)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"So Nabla shows you a live transcription during the appointment and then when you're done, you click generate note. It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses 'they/them' pronouns) as well as mental status exam... The HPI is decent." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/">(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
<li>"I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1k11a/">(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Neutral Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is semi decent. Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is decent but pretty half baked. Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"I have been using Nabla for 7 months." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ksbjwno/">(None, Reddit, 2024-02-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Functionality Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is more concise…but, organizes by date &amp; time only &amp; will only hold a certain # of notes" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/">(Forward_Pace2230, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
<li>"The notes are very generic and repetitive. 'The pt states he has a cough. The patient states he has a runny nose. The patient states....'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jufcbay/">(neatomosquito2020, Reddit, 2023-08-02)</a></li>
<li>"The problem is the option to add custom instructions isn’t very robust and prevents you from, say, adding a template and having the AI fill it out." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1k11a/">(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I like nabla however it turns to be quite verbose and I have to correct random spellings etc. It does allow me to listen to the patients better so I'm not worried about writing things down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktk92pu/">(OurPsych101, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
<li>"My rheumatologist used it back in October. I agreed to it but regret it. The visit notes were about 70% shorter than average, some of it had been edited, and lots of high points missing. Say no." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2akxts/">(Throwawayconcern2023, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is free only up to 30 consultations though. Unlocking unlimited consultations requires a $119 subscription." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1z4ie1/">(deonchest, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"None are that useful for assessment and plan. It's more for bolstering the subjective section of the note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"I gave up on it. Takes me 2 min to write my own primary care notes (after a little pre-charting)." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Market Context</h2>
<h3>Industry Insights</h3>

<li>"I think like a user said, this requires a super nuanced and expert level answer. I have experience from both the technical, academic and clinical NLP." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1e7bwun/d_medicalhealthcare_ai_experts_where_do_clinical/le2gb13/">(JuniorDoctors_AI, Reddit, 2024-07-20)</a></li>
