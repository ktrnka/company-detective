</ul>
<h2>Product Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nabla Copilot now supports 35 languages, enhancing communication between healthcare providers and patients who speak different languages <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-now-supports-35-languages-to-advance-culturally-responsive-care-302239179.html">(PR Newswire, 2024-09-05)</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nabla faces challenges related to the accuracy of its transcription technology, particularly concerning AI "hallucinations" or inaccuracies in transcriptions. The company is actively working to address these issues by refining its models and ensuring that clinicians review and approve all generated notes <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/concerns-about-medical-note-taking-tool-raised-after-researcher-discovers-it-invents-things-no-one-said-nabla-is-powered-by-openais-whisper">(Morales et al., Tom's Hardware, 2024-10-27)</a>.</li>

<p>Nabla is positioned as a leader in the ambient AI assistant space, with a strong focus on improving clinician workflows and enhancing patient care. The company's recent funding and partnerships indicate a promising trajectory for growth, although ongoing challenges related to AI accuracy and reliability will need to be managed to maintain trust among healthcare providers and patients alike.</p>

        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Product Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/">(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
<li>"So Nabla shows you a live transcription during the appointment and then when you're done, you click generate note. It gives you a gender neutral HPI (i.e. uses 'they/them' pronouns) as well as mental status exam (I'm in psychiatry) and plan." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"I love it so far. Makes note writing much faster and allows me to avoid typing during the visit while still remembering the details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k2816ai/">(subneil, Reddit, 2023-09-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla helps a little with allowing more eye contact with patient during visit but I gave up on it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is semi decent. Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is more concise…but, organizes by date &amp; time only &amp; will only hold a certain # of notes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/">(Forward_Pace2230, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Neutral Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Product Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1k11a/">(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is decent but pretty half baked. Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"None are that useful for assessment and plan. It's more for bolstering the subjective section of the note. Can be good for documenting long discussions with family too." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Data Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have zero confidence that Kaiser will use this for anything other than benefitting Kaiser as well as major concerns about how they will protect the data." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/">(labboy70, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"So there's no quality control mechanism and the source is deleted. That's a nope." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1ge8k3h/ai_for_patient_notes_medical_records/lubgttd/">(Ok-Equivalent9165, Reddit, 2024-10-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The visit notes were about 70% shorter than average, some of it had been edited, and lots of high points missing. Say no." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2akxts/">(Throwawayconcern2023, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"This is merely a more 'sophisticated' version of macro expansion - the result will be a 'bulletproof' record of an interaction as it didn't actually take place." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2xijgm/">(NinilchikHappyValley, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>
<li>"AI is not known for its accuracy. Its strength is in averaging general knowledge." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2aj275/">(NorCalFrances, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"I like nabla however it turns to be quite verbose and I have to correct random spellings etc." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktk92pu/">(OurPsych101, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>

<h2>Pricing Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is free only up to 30 consultations though. Unlocking unlimited consultations requires a $119 subscription." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1z4ie1/">(deonchest, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
