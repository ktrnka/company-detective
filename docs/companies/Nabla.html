<li>"Considering that we all hate charting the most and its the single biggest time suck -- its a game changer. like going from writing, to typing to dictating to 'notes done in under 1 min'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lbhc6s5/">(Elegant-Strategy-43, Reddit, 2024-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits to Patient Care</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It helps the doctor focus more attention on the patient, rather than constantly typing information." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l5f1p38/">(mYstiSagE, Reddit, 2024-05-24)</a></li>
<li>"I have no problem with it especially if that means my doctor can focus more on actual doctoring and less on paperwork." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3fjtbu/">(CarlileAMC, Reddit, 2024-05-10)</a></li>
<li>"I spend an extra few minutes with each patient now since I know I don't have to go back and spend 10 minutes typing up a note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1co8sej/doctor_recording_my_appointments/l3g4cyp/">(PresidentSnow, Reddit, 2024-05-10)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Usability and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is semi decent. Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is decent but pretty half baked. Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"I like nabla however it turns to be quite verbose and I have to correct random spellings etc. It does allow me to listen to the patients better so I'm not worried about writing things down. All in all I would settle for nabla." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktk92pu/">(OurPsych101, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>

<ul>
<li>"I have tried Nabla, and it seems great for the HPI section of a psychiatric intake, if you don’t mind it excluding some details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt1k11a/">(DekkuRen, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
<li>"None are that useful for assessment and plan. It's more for bolstering the subjective section of the note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
