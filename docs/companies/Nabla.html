Nabla has raised a total of $49 million in funding, with its most recent round being a $30 million Series B led by Cathay Innovation in January 2024 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/">(Dillet, TechCrunch, 2024-01-05)</a>.

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<h3>Partnerships and Collaborations</h3>
<p>Nabla has formed strategic partnerships with major healthcare organizations, including a significant collaboration with Permanente Medical Group, which includes 10,000 doctors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/nabla-raises-another-24-million-for-its-ai-assistant-for-doctors/">(Dillet, TechCrunch, 2024-01-05)</a>.

<h3>Challenges and Concerns</h3>
<p>Despite its advancements, Nabla faces challenges related to the accuracy of its transcription technology, which is based on OpenAI's Whisper model.

<h2>Executive Insights</h2>
<p>Delphine Groll, co-founder and COO, stated, "Supporting physicians with AI assistants like ours that enhance clinical documentation regardless of the language spoken bridges a gap in care delivery and drives forward health equity initiatives" <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nabla-now-supports-35-languages-to-advance-culturally-responsive-care-302239179.html">(PR Newswire, 2024-09-05)</a>. This reflects Nabla's commitment to improving healthcare delivery through technology.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nabla is positioned as a leader in the ambient AI healthcare space, with a strong focus on reducing clinician burnout and improving patient care through efficient documentation solutions. Its innovative approach, combined with strategic partnerships and a commitment to user feedback, sets it apart in a competitive market. However, ongoing challenges related to transcription accuracy and data privacy will require continued attention as the company scales its operations.</p>

        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Positive Sentiment</h2>
<h3>General Impressions</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love it so far. Makes note writing much faster and allows me to avoid typing during the visit while still remembering the details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k2816ai/">(subneil, Reddit, 2023-09-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is fantastic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMedicine/comments/1dsa1e1/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribes/lb6bwdw/">(Jedi_sephiroth, Reddit, 2024-07-01)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"So Nabla shows you a live transcription during the appointment and then when you're done, you click generate note. The HPI is decent." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is semi decent. Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I like nabla however it turns to be quite verbose and I have to correct random spellings etc. It does allow me to listen to the patients better so I'm not worried about writing things down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktk92pu/">(OurPsych101, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is decent but pretty half baked. Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/">(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is more concise…but, organizes by date &amp; time only &amp; will only hold a certain # of notes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/">(Forward_Pace2230, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment</h2>
<h3>Functionality Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The notes are very generic and repetitive. 'The pt states he has a cough. The patient states he has a runny nose. The patient states....'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jufcbay/">(neatomosquito2020, Reddit, 2023-08-02)</a></li>
<li>"None are that useful for assessment and plan. It's more for bolstering the subjective section of the note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is free only up to 30 consultations though. Unlocking unlimited consultations requires a $119 subscription." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1z4ie1/">(deonchest, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"My rheumatologist used it back in October. I agreed to it but regret it. The visit notes were about 70% shorter than average, some of it had been edited, and lots of high points missing. Say no." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2akxts/">(Throwawayconcern2023, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"This is merely a more 'sophisticated' version of macro expansion - the result will be a 'bulletproof' record of an interaction as it didn't actually take place." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2xijgm/">(NinilchikHappyValley, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>

<li>"Frankly. No. The shimmers are nice but they're are better out there. For a matte black eye shadow. Look at about face it's called art if darkness and it is a gorgeous black" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulta/comments/1f0ffxd/tell_me_what_you_need_and_ill_try_to_help/ljth27m/">(Calm-Home674, Reddit, 2024-08-25)</a></li>
