        <h1>About Nabla</h1>
<p>Nabla is a technology company that focuses on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare to enhance medical practice. The company was founded on July 1, 2018, and has developed an AI-powered ambient assistant known as Nabla Copilot. This tool is designed to assist clinicians by automating documentation and note-taking processes, thereby improving efficiency and reducing stress for healthcare providers <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nabla">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Nabla operates primarily in the B2B sector, serving healthcare professionals such as physicians, nurse practitioners, and mental health professionals. The company's products are distributed to over 45,000 clinicians across more than 85 health organizations, including prominent institutions like Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Mankato Clinic <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/concerns-about-medical-note-taking-tool-raised-after-researcher-discovers-it-invents-things-no-one-said-nabla-is-powered-by-openais-whisper">(Tom's Hardware, 2024-10-27)</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14">(AP News, 2024-10-26)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Sentiment: Positive Feedback</h2>
<h3>General Impressions</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I love it so far. Makes note writing much faster and allows me to avoid typing during the visit while still remembering the details." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k2816ai/">(subneil, Reddit, 2023-09-26)</a></li>
<li>"I was impressed when they used it on my visit personally. It 100% adds value id imagine." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7e2ryf/">(Dangerous-Cap-5474, Reddit, 2025-01-16)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is semi decent. Use it if I'm seeing a new patient in the hospital. Takes some of the cognitive burden off, especially at the end of a 7 day stretch." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla seems like a solid option for simpler workflows, but it might not be enough for the depth of internal medicine documentation." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/">(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-25)</a></li>
<li>"Focuses on simplicity and ease of use. Good for quick notes and straightforward documentation." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalMedicine/comments/1ia07ql/ai_scribe_recommendations_for_internal_medicine/">(doctorgreybc, Reddit, 2025-01-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Specific Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"So Nabla shows you a live transcription during the appointment and then when you're done, you click generate note. It gives you a gender neutral HPI ... The HPI is decent." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1y3r77/">(None, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla seemed to have the slight edge in regards to the final formatting of the intake note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b4uvub/ai_scribe_discussion/kt196a7/">(Xvi_G, Reddit, 2024-03-02)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Feedback</h2>
<h3>Usability and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is decent but pretty half baked. Captures most of what is said and knows where to put it (History, exam, A/P, PI etc). Produces paragraphs of prose." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"I like nabla however it turns to be quite verbose and I have to correct random spellings etc. It does allow me to listen to the patients better so I'm not worried about writing things down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktk92pu/">(OurPsych101, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla is more concise…but, organizes by date &amp; time only &amp; will only hold a certain # of notes" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/1b7pkux/favorite_ais_for_creating_outpt_notes/ktnwvj2/">(Forward_Pace2230, Reddit, 2024-03-06)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"None are that useful for assessment and plan. It's more for bolstering the subjective section of the note." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks7mmcp/">(FaFaRog, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"For some reason it sucks at documenting my reasoning in an A/P — wordy, misses the if-then logic." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1b0befu/best_ai_medical_scribe_tools_do_people_use_them/ks91vix/">(serene-denizen, Reddit, 2024-02-26)</a></li>
<li>"The visit notes were about 70% shorter than average, some of it had been edited, and lots of high points missing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1cih9p4/medical_ai_scribe_startup_nabla_rolling_out_tool/l2akxts/">(Throwawayconcern2023, Reddit, 2024-05-02)</a></li>
<li>"The notes are very generic and repetitive. 'The pt states he has a cough. The patient states he has a runny nose. The patient states....'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/149akp5/anyone_have_any_experience_with_ai_scribe_software/jufcbay/">(neatomosquito2020, Reddit, 2023-08-02)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Negative Feedback</h2>
<h3>Accuracy and Reliability Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Aside from the many many many concerns with accuracy/privacy/etc, it's already been shown that Nabla's transcription tool 'hallucinates' or makes up things that didn't happen..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/">(emamgo, Reddit, 2025-01-16)</a></li>
<li>"Nabla generated incorrect information into the note during my visit. I was later ordered incorrect labs by my doctor based on the notes it generated..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7log2e/">(Downtown-You3994, Reddit, 2025-01-17)</a></li>
<li>"It is absolutely essential to check the output before finalizing a note. This is no different from a human physician copy-forwarding a note..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7h7vzw/">(samu_rai, Reddit, 2025-01-16)</a></li>
<li>"I do not believe in the implementation of Nabla because of the hallucination risk and won’t be using it in the future." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7dzuj5/">(Bidet_Buyer, Reddit, 2025-01-16)</a></li>
<li>"Combine that with the privacy problems, hallucinations, and doctors not learning to listen and take notes and I have serious reservations." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/1i2ecqq/uihc_now_using_ai_tool_known_to_hallucinate/m7dyz74/">(newrambler, Reddit, 2025-01-16)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Subscription and Cost</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nabla is free only up to 30 consultations though. Unlocking unlimited consultations requires a $119 subscription." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/16qm7ji/ai_scribes_whos_been_using_them_and_whats_your/k1z4ie1/">(deonchest, Reddit, 2023-09-24)</a></li>
