        <h1>About International Community Health Services</h1>
<p>International Community Health Services (ICHS) is a federally qualified health center that has been operational for over 50 years, primarily serving the diverse communities of King County, Washington. Founded in 1973, ICHS has expanded from a single storefront clinic in Seattle’s Chinatown-International District to a regional healthcare provider with 11 service locations. The organization employs more than 600 staff members and serves over 30,000 patients annually <a href="https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/">(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>
<p>ICHS provides a wide range of health services, including primary care, dental care, behavioral health, and addiction treatment. The organization is particularly noted for its PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) program, which allows elderly participants to receive comprehensive care while living independently in their communities. This program has been operational since 2019 and is designed to meet the diverse needs of low-income, nursing-home eligible adults, with a focus on cultural competency <a href="https://iexaminer.org/offering-care-and-compassion-for-our-elders-toward-healthy-aging-and-wellness/">(ICHS, 2024-08-20)</a>.</p>
<p>ICHS primarily serves low-income, uninsured, and immigrant populations, regardless of their ability to pay. The organization is dedicated to providing culturally and linguistically appropriate health services, which is a cornerstone of its mission <a href="https://iexaminer.org/offering-care-and-compassion-for-our-elders-toward-healthy-aging-and-wellness/">(ICHS, 2024-08-20)</a>.</p>
<p>The organization generates revenue through its healthcare services, which are often subsidized by federal funding due to its status as a federally qualified health center. ICHS's services are distributed through its multiple service locations across King County, ensuring accessibility for its target populations.</p>
<p>Over time, ICHS has grown significantly in scale and scope, expanding its service offerings and facilities to better meet the needs of its community. Third parties often describe ICHS as a vital player in the healthcare landscape of King County, particularly for marginalized communities, and recognize its commitment to health equity and quality care <a href="https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/">(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Kelli Nomura is the current CEO of ICHS. She has been recognized as a Diversity Champion by the Puget Sound Business Journal for her commitment to health equity and advocacy for removing barriers to care. Nomura has over 30 years of experience in healthcare and community leadership, having previously served on the ICHS Board of Directors and as the division director for the Behavioral Health and Recovery Division of King County’s Department of Community and Human Services <a href="https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/">(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>

<h2>New Facility and Services</h2>
<p>ICHS is developing the Ron Chew Healthy Aging and Wellness Center, set to open in 2025. This new facility will provide a 25,000-square-foot space aimed at expanding services for vulnerable older adults, quadrupling the number of seniors served through ICHS's PACE program. The center will focus on delivering comprehensive, culturally competent care to meet the needs of its primarily Asian immigrant clientele <a href="https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/">(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>
<h2>Property Acquisition for Affordable Housing</h2>
<p>In March 2024, ICHS acquired a property for $7.88 million in collaboration with the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) to develop a mixed-use facility that will include 90 affordable housing units and a healthcare facility. This acquisition reflects ICHS's commitment to addressing housing and healthcare needs in the Chinatown International District, despite challenges in competing with for-profit developers <a href="https://iexaminer.org/chinatown-id-legacy-business-city-produce-to-relocate-after-ichs-acquires-property-for-affordable-housing-project-with-lihi/">(Alexa Strabuk, IExaminer, 2024-10-07)</a>.</p>
<h2>Community Impact and Recognition</h2>
<p>In 2023, ICHS served 31,230 patients, with four out of five being low-income and seven out of nine being people of color. The organization has been recognized for its clinical quality performance, receiving the Health Center Quality Leader Gold Badge from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration <a href="https://napost.com/2024/news1-12132024/">(Kelli Nomura, N.A.P, 2024-12-16)</a>.</p>
<h2>Partnerships and Collaborations</h2>
<p>ICHS collaborates with various organizations to enhance its service offerings. For instance, it partners with Youth Eastside Services to provide mental health support at the Highland Health Center, a school-based health center that serves students in the Bellevue School District <a href="https://www.bsd405.org/about-us/news/news-details/~board/bsd-news/post/students-staff-and-community-partners-share-in-a-season-of-gratitude">(Students, Staff and Community Partners, 2024-12-20)</a>. This partnership exemplifies ICHS's commitment to integrating health services within educational settings to improve access for youth.</p>
<h2>Financial Health and Employment</h2>
<p>ICHS is described as a financially sound organization with a stable executive team, currently serving over 30,000 patients a year and conducting more than 135,000 visits. The organization offers competitive salaries and benefits to its employees, reflecting its commitment to maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce <a href="https://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit-job/00651864afef40ca848da011610f4515-director-of-ichs-pace-and-senior-services-international-community-health-services-seattle">(Director of ICHS PACE and Senior Services, 2024)</a>.</p>
