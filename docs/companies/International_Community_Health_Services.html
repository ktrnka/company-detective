<h2>Community Impact and Challenges</h2>
<p>ICHS serves a significant number of patients in the Chinatown-International District (CID), where recent increases in violent crime have deterred some individuals from seeking care. CEO Kelli Nomura expressed concern over the safety of patients, emphasizing the need for a safe environment for healthcare access <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1">(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)</a>. Despite these challenges, ICHS remains committed to its mission, and a slight decrease in violent crime in the CID may help restore patient confidence <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1">(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)</a>.</p>

Additionally, the organization is involved in community initiatives aimed at improving public safety and health equity in the CID <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/community/facing-race/violent-crime-cid-deterring-patients-seeking-medical-care/281-516aaf68-830b-47d4-a865-bf6490aa89a1">(Sharon Yoo, King 5, 2024-12-09)</a>.</p>
