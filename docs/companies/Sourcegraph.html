<h3>Product Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sourcegraph helps devs with being able to search across their entire code base, across repo, lang, file type etc to find exactly what they need in sub sec." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i0whr4b/">(Rohannntx, Reddit, 2022-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"Built in IDE-like features, extensions to their favorite dev tools and advanced code intelligence keeps devs in flow and allows them to ship better code faster." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i0whr4b/">(Rohannntx, Reddit, 2022-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"While the heart of Sourcegraph is its 'Google-like' search, we are solving for increased dev velocity (saving up to 30 mins/eng/day), better onboarding, finding and fixing vulns, better incident response (like log4j) and boosting overall code reuse and code health." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i0whr4b/">(Rohannntx, Reddit, 2022-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"Sourcegraph is actually fantastic. No reason to use GitHub's search on open source code anymore." (kevincox_ca, Reddit, 2021-08-19)</li>
<li>"Wow, they allow quite sophisticated searches. Not only code, but commit messages too." (Kissaki0, Reddit, 2021-08-20)</li>
<li>"I just used Sourcegraph for the first time recently and it's pretty nice." (marqis, Reddit, 2020-10-01)</li>
<li>"Sourcegraph offers the code intelligence you're used to in your editor, but instead of being in your editor it is when you are browsing code on your code host (i.e. on GitHub, BitBucket, etc.) Even when reviewing pull requests / diffs!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9kmr4p/sourcegraph_is_now_open_source/e70lz1i/">(Sourcegraph Engineer, Reddit, 2018-10-02)</a></li>
<li>"The big thing seems to be that it integrates with web tools, such as GitHub.

<li>"Personally I use the text search a lot, even though I could just use my editor. This is mainly due to it being a browser search shortcut + the more expressive search syntax + nicer UI for browsing/reading code." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9kmr4p/sourcegraph_is_now_open_source/e70nbpf/">(Sourcegraph Engineer, Reddit, 2018-10-02)</a></li>
