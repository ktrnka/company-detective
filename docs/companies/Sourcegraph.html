<li>"Wow, they allow quite sophisticated searches. Not only code, but commit messages too." (Kissaki0, Reddit, 2021-08-20)</li>
<li>"Sourcegraph solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month)." (lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)</li>
<li>"Sourcegraph offers the code intelligence you're used to in your editor, but instead of being in your editor it is when you are browsing code on your code host." (slimsag, Reddit, 2018-10-02)</li>
