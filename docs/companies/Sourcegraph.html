<li>"While the heart of Sourcegraph is its 'Google-like' search, we are solving for increased dev velocity (saving up to 30 mins/eng/day), better onboarding, finding and fixing vulns, better incident response (like log4j) and boosting overall code reuse and code health." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i0whr4b/">(Rohannntx, Reddit, 2022-03-16)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Product Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"They allow quite sophisticated searches. Not only code, but commit messages too." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/p7k2bq/why_sourcegraph_is_indexing_the_open_source/h9mvkv8/">(Kissaki0, Reddit, 2021-08-20)</a></li>

<h2>Constructive Criticism</h2>
<h3>Product Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Some of this IDE-like functionality does depend on an additional precise code index to work, which, unfortunately, Sourcegraph does not generate automatically." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/">(Scott Reisor, Reddit, 2024-03-13)</a></li>

<li>"Sourcegraph solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went closed source." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ftt6sf/sourcebot_an_opensource_sourcegraph_alternative/">(lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)</a></li>

<h2>Recruitment Experience</h2>
<h3>Candidate Feedback</h3>

<li>"I had 4 interviews with them (stages I mean), including with the CEO and I got ghosted after that as well. Never heard from them since then." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpiqm46/">(Confidenceismyname, Reddit, 2024-02-08)</a></li>
<li>"Sourcegraph often has specific job adverts out and seems to fish for specific people, not specific skills they put in their job ads." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kphil23/">(curiousshortguy, Reddit, 2024-02-08)</a></li>

<h2>Product Innovations</h2>
<h3>New Features</h3>

<li>"I first used copilot, didn't like it, switched to just copy-pasting large blocks of code into GPT-4. Then I tried Cody and it has blown me away!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17pd9cn/github_copilot_vs_cody_compared_on_realworld/m9cvdda/">(Temporary-Ad2478, Reddit, 2025-01-26)</a></li>
