            <h1>About Imagine Pediatrics</h1>
<p>Imagine Pediatrics is a pediatrician-led medical group founded in 2022, based in Nashville, Tennessee. The company specializes in providing 24/7 virtual-first care for children with special health care needs, particularly those covered by Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) plans. Their services are designed to support families by offering medical, behavioral, and social care, aiming to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and improve the quality of life for children with complex medical conditions <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imagine-pediatrics-launches-first-kind-140000673.html">(Business Wire, 2023-11-29)</a>.</p>
