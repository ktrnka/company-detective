            <h1>About Imagine Pediatrics</h1>
<p>Imagine Pediatrics is a Nashville-based pediatrician-led medical group that specializes in providing 24/7 virtual-first care for children with complex medical conditions and special health care needs. Founded in 2022, the company aims to improve access to high-quality pediatric care by surrounding children with a multidisciplinary team that includes doctors, nurses, social workers, and therapists. The organization currently operates in Texas and Florida, serving over 20,000 children and families <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imagine-pediatrics-launches-first-kind-140000673.html">(Business Wire, 2023-11-29)</a>.</p>
<h2>Services and Products</h2>

- <strong>Care Coordination</strong>: Assistance in navigating complex medical needs, coordinating with specialists, and managing medications.
- <strong>Support for Caregivers</strong>: Resources and support for private duty nurses and caregivers.</p>
<h2>Business Model</h2>
<p>Imagine Pediatrics employs a value-based, population health payment model, partnering with Medicaid managed care organizations to deliver care at no additional cost to patients. This model allows the company to take full risk on the total cost of care for enrolled children, aiming to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and improve overall health outcomes <a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/population-health-management/complex-care/article/53080968/qa-imagine-pediatrics-ceo-george-boghos">(Healthcare Innovation, 2023-12-19)</a>.</p>
<h2>Revenue and Scale</h2>
<p>The company collaborates with health plans such as Superior Health Plan and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan to enhance care for children with medical complexities. In its first 10 months, Imagine Pediatrics conducted over 50,000 care interactions, resulting in a 15% reduction in inpatient admissions and a 20% reduction in total cost of care for engaged patients <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imagine-pediatrics-launches-first-kind-140000673.html">(Business Wire, 2023-11-29)</a>.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>Imagine Pediatrics' services are distributed through a mobile app and direct phone access, ensuring that families can receive immediate assistance whenever needed. The enrollment process involves an initial call to determine eligibility, followed by app download and a 15-minute introductory call to understand the child's needs.</p>
