      <p>I’ve been using this wonderful app  since it came out. Where other apps changed their apps into oo many  details this one stayed simple.I find myself making me-inspiration booklets  with images or phrases and words for titles etc. 

You might try typing up captions on a transparent backdrop of vintage paoers. Please, just don't take away the little books like another major app did. And thanks for not making us put them on a silly faux bookcase. I wouldn’t mind a few black covers.</p>

      <h4>I expected better, 2 stars (Rezzenonne, Apple App Store, 2023-07-24)</h4>
      <p>Although Wacom’s Bamboo Paper app performs adequately as a standalone handwriting app, its syncing capabilities between platforms (Windows to iOS and vice versa) leave much to be desired. The lack of scaling, zoom, and adjustments creates significant issues, especially since screen sizes differ between devices. This results in writing being cut off the page when viewed on a smaller device, significantly impacting the overall user experience and productivity. Wacom, being a well-established company, could benefit from refining these essential features to enhance cross-platform usability and ensure a more seamless user experience.</p>

      <p>The app seems like it could be good, but it doesn’t support the Apple Pencil.  I didn’t find any warning about this design choice anywhere in the description.  I only found it when trying to use the app, and googling it.  

I wouldn’t be complaining if that big caveat to the utility of the app wasn’t hidden.</p>

      <h4>Palm Rejection doesn’t work at all, 2 stars (Siyliss87, Apple App Store, 2023-05-08)</h4>
      <p>I actually love this app and have been using it for year HOWEVER they never fixed or gave an option to turn off the ability to draw with your hand. It picks up my palm ALL THE TIME and it is seriously annoying having to have to erase so many dots when taking even the smallest amount of notes. 

Unfortunately this has made me have to look for an alternative that takes these basic features into consideration. 

I recommend this app ONLY if you wear gloves while drawing or touching the screen at any point. Kind of annoying.

PLEASE FIX THIS 

Or at the least make a toggle switch to turn off drawing with anything other than the Apple Pencil or stylus.</p>

      <p>Using the iPad Air 2 with the Adonit Dash 3 pen and this app in combination is excellent. Good-writing,  palm rejection works great 99% of the time. Otherwise you can buy a cheap handwriting glove if you wish. It works by Bluetooth. Make sure you turn the pen on along with the tablet's Bluetooth. The Adonit Dash3 in combination with Bamboo paper is the best most consistent writing experience on the iPad Air 2 which doesn't support any of the Apple Pencils BTW. There is a new electro pen with a copper pen tip that has just been released. It has potential with Bamboo Paper but could use a bit of fine tuning. That pen is not Bluetooth but palm rejection is a bit more hot or miss.. Bamboo paper is great for writing and journaling which is what I mainly use it for. On the iPad Air 2, I would recommend the Adonit Dash 3 pen to use Bamboo Paper.</p>

      <p>I was going to return my Logitech Crayon stylus until I found this app. I had tried other journaling/note taking apps and they all disappointed me. A lot are really high powered. PDF support and import audio and videos and export in 3000 formats while multitasking and... holy moly I just want to write yo, what even is this? 

Then I found Bamboo Paper. This app just feels nice right from the getgo. I have like 12 physical journals each with a different theme for taking notes. I’m really just trying to consolidate them in one space. And then from there I’m just looking to write. I don’t need any of that high powered whatever. The interface is lovely. I haven’t encountered any of the glitching other people have mentioned. I’ve also only had this a day, but it seems reliable. I tested the backups and they worked. Backups are limited to the Bamboo ecosystem which is technically every platform but not super nice. Some kind of automatic cloud storage or Evernote syncing would be great, but I’d take this over the other apps any day.</p>

Some of the adjustments for the different writing utensils seem a little light but they are still workable. I usually find my happy spot right in the middle with the second option. The one thing I wish was different is that you have the option to show all of your note books in a grid instead of just a roll, however, that is just a minor complaint.

      <p>I like this program because with a good stylus it is the most like writing or doodling on real paper.

It would be better if it had a lasso tool, supported cut/copy/paste, and had tags for pages. (I dream of a day when all programs have a universal format for tag support.)

It could also use better tools for importing, working with, and exporting photos. It would be great if they added support for import/export and working with text.

But until that day this is the best program if you just want to write something on a piece of paper and have it digitalized. There is a notebook feature but I export my pages as png and keep it all in a notebook program with more features (exactly which one changes)</p>

      <h4>Severely Needs UI Update, 3 stars (Clombings, Apple App Store, 2020-05-14)</h4>
      <p>THe whole app feels old and in need of balancing, fine-tuning and a user-options menu that would allow us to set preferences.

For one: if you’re drawing too slow, the color picker will appear where you are drawing. I cannot express how many times this is fumbled up my drawing experience.. please take this out or let me turn it off. 

Two: zooming on the page is the least responsive zoom experience of any drawing app I’ve used. Half the time it doesn’t work and ends up putting a line of ink through my work where I was using my fingers to zoom. 

Three: please give the eraser fixed size options, the way it changes size based on scrub speed leaves almost no consistency if someone is trying to articulately mask or clean a sketch.

Four: please let me change the paper type of each individual page. I have paid for all of the tools and I use them. I like to have journals for different focuses, and sometimes my different focuses would benefit from different paper types. I would like to keep all of my focus in one place without having to start a second journal on the same topic just to have a different paper type.

Five: Black and dark paper types need to trigger the UI to switch to light toggles. When using black paper, I have to go searching for UI toggles and it’s deeply frustrating. 

Six: please get rid of the Wacom Pen Sync button that exists on every page. I have an Apple Pencil and will never use anything else. I get that you make this hardware, but I don’t need it visible all the time. Put it on a different options page.

Seven: Allow cellular data sync. 

Eight: The color palette system is limited, I wish it felt more like procreate.

Nine: placing and adjusting an image is incredibly frustrating and I hate this app to its core when I’m trying to get something done and the palm of my hand triggers the image adjust dialog.

Ten: Please let me doodle on the covers of the journals and overall create a more personalized user experience.

Eleven: Please let me stack journals, archive journals that I no longer wish to have out. This would be amazing for me as I generate a lot of content and would like to put old projects away.

Twelve: I would like higher resolution pages, at least to have the option of them. Exported images are very low resolution. It would be nice if I could at least print these sketches on PAPER and have them hold a 1:1 quality with the size of my screen.. Maybe just give me the freedom to set the dimensions of a notebook? Or have it be infinitely flexible like Moleskine Flow?

Thirteen: searchable handwriting. I would pay for this tool. If you had this in your app, it would be a college student’s dream.</p>

      <h4>Great App for teaching, 5 stars (LariosOnBass, Apple App Store, 2020-02-08)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Bamboo Paper App since 2014 and over the years I’ve been wanting several features add it to make the work flow better and more productive.
Bamboo Paper is a great because it integrates with your work flow and provides you with the capabilities of sharing your work with others. The ability to be able to share your work across other platforms and syncing your work makes it possible to work from almost anywhere. 
I gave it five stars but because of the following I will rate it 4.9 stars. This leaves room for the following:
I wish that there were other choices in the type and color of lines to format the pages, that there was the ability to type on each page and that there was a better way to control files, and manage your notebooks. More pens and productivity tools.

This app has been around for a long time and from the beginning it has been a tool to go to when I’m teaching. I strongly recommend this App if you are a presenter, teach take notes or just like to doodle.
Start using it today! I will be looking forward more tools integrated into the page and better file managements.</p>

I’ve used this app for nearly 2 years now with my Bamboo Intuos stylus. I had to uninstall the app yesterday for storage purposes not related to the app. I reinstall it today, sign in to Inkspace, connect my stylus, but the complimentary full tool set is greyed out and will not restore. There is a button that says “restore” but  when I press it, nothing happens. It doesn’t try to load or anything. It’s extremely frustrating to suddenly not have access to these tools for free when I have had them for this long with the stylus.</p>

• Please include ability to insert text boxes and type with keyboard (with the ability to change the size of text box)...
• Add ability to change paper type at any time...
• Annotation of PDF files should be standard...
• Need to add option to ignore palm when using pen...

      <h4>Almost perfect...., 2 stars (IAMEGI, Apple App Store, 2018-08-01)</h4>
      <p>Bamboo Paper in my honest opinion has probably the best and smoothest interface. I’ve used multiple apps for note taking, even ones that charge an arm and a leg just to be presented with some laggy or glitchy technology. But Bamboo has taken note of what true to life note taking should be like and reinvented it for a tablet. 

Whenever I’m taking notes with my Apple Pencil it doesn’t feel like I’m writing on a tablet, that’s how smooth it is! 

But although I have a list of great things to say about it, I still have some wants from it to. This app would be my to go to app for all note taking if...

A few updates came around. 

My main pet peeve is the fact that notes can’t be taken on landscape. Whenever I start my notes on portrait I’m forced to keep taking them on portrait. It’d be awesome if you would incorporate the ability for the paper to rotate with the orientation desired. 

Along with this, the app still glitches when zooming in and out during note taking or designing. I always get the pop up that if I turn off multitasking it’ll make it better but it actually makes it worse. So as a result, this causes unintentional writing or marks on paper. 

Not as major, but recording during note taking process or recording option when a note taking notebook is chosen would add a lot of value to the app.

Lastly, there should be more personalization options for the notebooks. I understand there are a variety of notebooks we can choose from that come with their own paper layout and cover but having the ability to interchange the covers would move this app to my #1 note taking app, actually my sole note taking app.

I hope that some of these thoughts are already being worked on because I honestly can’t find a better app that makes note taking fun and stress free.</p>

      <p>I have several hundred pages of important notes and sketches on this app. I need to have them backed up and unharmed so I can reload them onto a new iPad. In the top right corner the app offers storage through Inkspace if you sign in. I sign in, it says I can return to the app, so I do and it appears to be backing up. Within 5 seconds it stops randomly and still shows a red “x” on the cloud icon. When I press the icon to redo it I’m completely signed out as if I never tried in the first place. I’ve tried over and over at least a dozen times and it’s the same thing.

If I absolutely have to I’ll go through each notebook and download each of the ~700 pages individually to my photo gallery. It is frustrating to not have a functioning cloud service from a brand that has such a large presence in digital art and communication.</p>

It is a great app, but I would like to see more updates more often with more function ability add-ons such as Archived folders, highlighter for note taking, dual notebook view, etc.... But overall I couldn’t say I’ve been more pleased.</p>

      <h4>Sync only on iOS devices, 2 stars (arqqon, Apple App Store, 2018-03-01)</h4>
      <p>App itself does what it states except sync across devices. Precision is questionable in my experiences because I use apple pen. Compared to so many other sketching and drawing apps, bamboo paper falls short. Hand writing and line quality feels unstable. Perhaps there is a better support for Wacom pens as there is a specific connection tool just for the Wacom products. But this was something I was willing to overlook since the description states there is better quality experience through Wacom products.

My main qualm is with the fact that there is no way to transfer purchases from iOS to windows 10. On the windows app, there is no way to log into inkspace. What is the point of Wacom account if there’s no way to sign into it on the application so that you can transfer purchases and data? If you do not intend to fix this issue, please add a way for customers to be reimbursed. On top of this, when I contacted customer support, I was told there was no cross platform synchronization. If I purchased something on iOS, it stays on iOS, on iPad.

On their website, they claim the Wacom account is a wonderful way to connect apps and maintain registered products. The Wacom website provides a marketplace for apps that is, quite frankly, confusing and unusable. They display free apps that you cannot download or are missing download links. It is riddled with many missing pages or they just refuse to load. Why display bamboo paper on the marketplace if it’s not an app that can be purchased through the marketplace? Their inadequacy does not just stop there, all their services provided by their website is riddled with issues such as missing links and confusing product registration process. 

I do believe Wacom has great products to offer, but their services fall short in ways that add to frustration and inconvenience rather than facilitate work flow.</p>

      <h4>Really needs a few features, 3 stars (Live and Grow, Apple App Store, 2018-02-17)</h4>
      <p>Handwriting experience is very nice, but the app needs, in particular, a lasso tool -- hopefully one that would allow the user to move, copy, cut, paste, change color, and change line style.  

The user gets the option of purchasing new notebook styles, but there are few differences among the styles.

The app has improved over many generations, but the absence of the lasso tool is a deal breaker for me.</p>

I take a lot of notes for work, about 7-9 pages per day. It’s a lot and I need to be able to search them relatively quickly. However, you can’t search notes or quickly flip through them. The page turning arrow is annoyingly slow when you have any type of volume. I’d also like to see more subcategories like tabs or groups of books.  I have the Bamboo Fineline which is great when paired with the app as well.</p>

So, honestly, I don't use this app much any more. It's greatest feature, however, is that it is optimized to use the WHOLE screen, unlike other app that waste so much space with UIs trying to mimic physical notebooks; Morpholio Journal and to a lesser extent, Penultimate. It also does not lock you into one orientation like Paper by 53.

      <h4>Doesn't work on iPad Pro, 1 stars (lagitane1, Apple App Store, 2017-05-09)</h4>
      <p>I've been using Bamboo Paper for at least five years. I have many archived notebooks, and have come to depend heavily on this app in my work. Since I switched to the iPad Pro one and a half years ago, Bamboo Paper has been failing miserably. 
At first there was no compatibility for iPencil - ridiculous. The resolution was horrible. They fixed those items after a few months, but unfortunately the wrist sensitivity was never improved; I am constantly erasing stray marks on the page. 
For the past 8 months or so, I have been getting a notification to update the app. Repeatedly. It does not update. Since they created Inkspace, my notebooks do not sync in the cloud. I called support a couple of times, useless. 
They provided an "update" in March that did nothing. My app did not update, as far as I know. 
Now I am furious - for the past month or two (maybe since the "update") my notebooks have been completely screwed up. I will open the app and have two notebooks for separate projects suddenly have the same name. The pages are still there, but since they have the same name I have no idea which book is which. I create a new notebook, and next time I open the app it copies the name AND PAGES of an existing notebook. I delete the pages in one notebook, and it wound up deleting the pages in the original notebook too. So now I can't create a new notebook, I have three notebooks with the same name, and two contain exactly zero pages - while the third has pages from a different notebook. 
Unbelievable. I'm done with Bamboo Paper, and I'm done with Wacom. Losing work history is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. Get your act together - it's a real shame. This was a great app; not sure why they couldn't embrace Pro and iPencil right off the bat. 
Buh-bye.</p>

      <p>Considering the cost of a Wacom Bamboo Fineline 3, you would think the company would support its apps.  Rather than doing a inclusion of supported iPads, the apps should be written specifically excluding which iOS devices are incompatible.  If they had done it this users wouldn't get an error saying that their 2017 iPad, which has the same screen as supported devices, is incompatible. 

Definitely not impressed and the fact that for handwriting recognition to work you have to upload your content to Wacom's cloud.  Feels a little insecure and who knows in the T&C whether or not your content becomes Wacom's, didn't bother reading the T&C.  

Doesn't matter.  I'll definitely follow Wacom's Support Rep's advice I received this morning and return the Fineline later this afternoon.</p>

      <p>It is a basic program that lacks fundamental features to make it comparable to other note taking apps. The biggest one is it's lack of compatibility with the Apple Pencil (and even their own styluses) primarily with palm rejection. It defeats the purpose of having such a stylus as I am constantly erasing small marks made by my palm. It is a simple fix, but one that needs to happen.
Even after this, it need a little more flexibility in changing the paper types within the note book without also changing all the other pages in the notebook.
Lots of little things like this, but it gets annoying.</p>

      <p>Even when paired with its own stylus, Bamboo Paper performs terribly.  It's all about "palm rejection"...  The app registers pressure from your palm and NOT input from the stylus forcing you to use an artificial writing/drawing position with your hand held off and above the writing service.  Think of a conductor leading an orchestra...  Let that sink in.  Who writes like that?  By the time you read this, I will have deleted Bamboo Paper and returned the Bamboo Fineline 2 to the retailer.  You've been warned...  Bamboo Paper is NOT ready for prime time.</p>

      <p>This is pretty much a notebook. Good for note takers but not the greatest app for art. There are limited colors (no color wheel swatch) and unless you pay for the stylus ($30-$70), you're stuck with limited tools (pen, pencil, marker thing) and there is no visible way to add layers the way professionals would. I bought the $70 stylus and makes little to no difference than using my finger or a dollar store stylus. It just unlocks 3 more tools (brush, watercolor, crayon). Overall, big disappointment and reluctant to use a wacom product for art ever again. Also, I'm pretty skeptical and worried for privacy with that suspicious contract we are forced to agree to at the beginning. Still concerned about that.</p>

      <p>I used this app a lot with my Apple Pencil. The textures of the paper and smoothness of the pencil and application make this a great app for drawing or wring down thoughts. I journaled in the app for awhile.

The downside is that I bought all of the notebooks and pencils but when I needed to redo load it, there was no way to restore my purchases. Apple support said to talk to Wacom(the developer) and they in turn sent me back to apple. That being said, I signed up for the Wacom Cloud in hopes that would assist in the problem, but it did not. So, it is a great app, but I don't recommend buying anything!</p>

My go-to app is Noteshelf and I use the 53 Pencil for note taking.  I am not interested in drawing.  If I dump iOS, I will definitely get a Surface Pro.

      <p>I Love this app!  

However, the recent update for the apple pencil left me frustrated.

I have an ipad pro and the apple pencil.

The fine line option for your pencil tool seems to now draw super light. Its nearly unusable for me now.

Same holds true for the water color tool.

The ink tool works great.

The crayon works great.

The marker tool is unaffected by pressure.  I would suggest having pressure influence the size and allowing the tool to draw a finer line under the fine setting. (The fine line option is still too big imho)

The eraser is also unaffected by pressure. Again I would suggest having pressure affect the size.

Lastly, upon zooming, it would be great if the tools keep their original screen size and not get affected by the zoom.  That way you could zoom in to draw a finer line or erase a little less.

Have the tools be drawn to local screen space.... Not world.

Please fix soon. Love this app.  Seems broken now.</p>

      <p>***UPDATED UPDATED REVIEW***

This update or the last broke the ability to synchronize across multiple devices. Also, Bamboo Paper constantly freezes on my main iPad. But I'm afraid to reinstall it since synchronization is broken. On my backup iPad, I've reinstalled and synchronized but NO notepads are downloaded. Horrible. The Stars keep dropping like flies after every effort to improve.

***UPDATED REVIEW***

After this app became unusable on iOS 9, I reverted back to iOS 8. This app is the main ingredient to my academic success but when it crashed al day, I was devastated and grateful Apple was still signing the iOS 8 image for me to roll back. That said, Apple does offer the beta builds for upcoming OS releases and developers should test when a major update is on the horizon. This user impacting issue is solely Wacom's fault and hopefully they learn from it. Also I REALLY wish palm rejection was implemented in the app. It is extremely awkward taking notes without resting your hand down. 

*** ORIGINAL REVIEW***

This is a great app for taking notes in class and or sketching.  Problem is, after updating to iOS 9, the app is crashing all over the place. From simple tasks like changing paper type to tapping on a notebook, creating a new notebook, changing pen color, etc.  I hope folks at Wacom handle this quickly.  The app is practically unusable right now.</p>

If you are graphic designer and trying to get the absolute best artistic features for your work, this may not be your app and I suggest using Adobe or something else. But if you love to draw out ideas while taking notes or even inserting visual representations(pictures), look no further! This app handles all that and does even more.

      <h4>Goodbye expensive Moleskin Notebooks, 5 stars (Nivek Cook, Apple App Store, 2015-12-29)</h4>
      <p>As a freelance graphic designer, I have always used the traditional method of carrying around Moleskin notebooks/sketchbooks and pencils in order to record my ideas and thoughts during the day.  After reading a dozen reviews about new apps and Bluetooth pressure-sensitive pens, I decided it was time to give technology a shot.  I purchased a Bamboo Fineline 2 pen and downloaded various apps to try taking notes and sketches with.  Now, nothing beats the traditional pencil and paper, but in my case where I will take quick notes and sketches of ideas I have this solution works great! I no longer have to purchase Moleskin Notebooks at $20 a piece and keep try and keep track of them.  I have all my notes and sketches in one place all the time, organized and ready to go.  Then, once I have the final idea I like, I transfer them to pencil and paper or Illustrator, Photoshop or Indesign.  This app though, has been the best for taking notes and quick sketches so far... At least while using the Bamboo Fineline 2 pen. It has its quirks, of course, but the pro's far out way the con's.</p>

      <p>I use bamboo paper on a dinosaur iPad 2 and it works perfectly most of the time. (Freezes sometimes due to ancient iPad).

I am a medical student and plan to get the iPad pro and pencil for drawing diagrams and keeping notebooks in this app. This is the single most helpful and used app in all of my studies!

My PC is linked through Wacom Dropzone and all I need to do is screen capture any photo from lecture, paste to Dropzone, and BOOM, it's on my iPad, no hassle. Draw, annotate, highlight anything you import.

What more I would like to see:
Wacom needs to branch out from just the artist's features. I want a higher quality photo import even when zoomed (granted I have an old non retina iPad, but it's still poor sometimes).

More functionality with options for text input, adding straight lines, boxes, or other shapes.

A PC application for viewing notebooks. The portal is ok though.

In the ink space portal, I want it to know when my iPad was in landscape view. I always use it in landscape and every PDF uploads in portrait with all of my pages sideways. This is frustrating. 

Option to add Notebook tabs to separate and quickly access material from different test sections.</p>

      <p>This is the best sketching, doodling and note taking app for the new iPad Pro and Pencil. I've tried dozens of apps for drawing, painting and note taking. They all have their strengths and weaknesses but if you are looking for that pencil/pen on paper feel with amazing fidelity this is the only app you need.</p>

Until today, I would have rated it as a 10 star App.
But since I installed the new IOS update, the App crashes every time I try to write a note.
I hope the developers will please fix this.
I deleted the App, and then re-installed it, thinking that might solve the problem. But, the problem still remains .</p>

      <h4>It was a very good app - until the last version, 1 stars (Max Pepper, Apple App Store, 2015-10-08)</h4>
      <p>I'm using a Bamboo bluetooth stylus model CS-600 with the app running on iPad mini 3.
Here are the issues I'm experiencing:
- the app is crushing often, almost constantly on attempts to change color of the notebook cover, the name of the notebook, the paper type in the notebook. It also crashes regularly on the attempts to change the color of the stroke while writing.
- the line goes out of sync with the tooltip of the stylus towards the right edge of the screen. The line appears too far to the left from the tip of the pen. This is not happening on the left side or in the middle of the screen. This changes when the orientation of the screen is changed, so it seems to be a software and not a hardware issue.
- the mark on the paper appears when the pen is lifted, rather then when it touches the screen. This create a disorienting experience, especially when trying to work on small and precise strokes, because it does not allow the user to orient the initial position of the line before drawing it.</p>

      <p>I use bamboo paper to take notes during class lectures. I like to draw the diagrams sometimes using different colors and widths. I used to love this app and recommend it to friends who want a light but functional note taking app.

Since the new update, the only cool thing to come out of bamboo paper is the logo. Every time I try to change the pen color, my app crashes. Every time I try to go back to another page To read notes, the app crashes. Please fix this now. This app has become barely functional and I'm apprehensive every time I open it up. 

I might switch to another app that supports my fine line. Thanks for creating the stylus, but it's a bit sad that the native app of the stylus doesn't even work.</p>

      <p>it is very unstable. I tried to add other notebooks "Maker" and "Writer" as Wacom calls them (and are free as part of the app), but when I try to add them it crashes the app and it closes. As for the notebook that there is a small fee to purchase and install, it seems to work fine and not crash the app.

The notebook that comes installed with the app, the way it works, it leaves a small space between the tip of the pen and when it starts writing, it might be okay for some users but in my case it throws me off a bit.

Sadly I can't recommend this app, and I can't recommend the pen either.

P.S. The Wacom app that is suppose to update the firmware in the pen, doesn't work at all for me. No matter what I do it keeps searching for the pen and does not see it at all.</p>

Pros:
Beautiful notebook covers
Beautiful papers
Ink flow is perfect
Pressure sensitivity
Selection of pen, pencil, crayon...

Cons:
Accuracy isn't perfect. Wish I could dial in my hand writing position.
Can't change paper template for individual pages, only the entire notebook
Needs better tools for note taking (see GoodNotes)</p>

      <h4>Great program. Needs layer support, 4 stars (Msquare323, Apple App Store, 2015-08-07)</h4>
      <p>This program has the best pressure support of any pen enabled app for the iPad. The pencil tool actually works like a pencil. No other drawing program can boast that. Bamboo Paper needs layer support, and then it would be an incredible app and not just a useful tool. I'm not sure if Wacom hasn't added this functionality because of a non competition clause they might have with another company that produces digital editing or drawing software, like perhaps Adobe.  But Bamboo Paper best utilizes their pressure sensitivity enabled styli in a manner that makes the drawing process fun and not a chore. 
Please add layers in the new update</p>

      <h4>Close but no cigar, 2 stars (SethRchapin, Apple App Store, 2015-06-21)</h4>
      <p>I am using the bamboo stylus and the app is still very unpredictable when it comes to drawing and writing. In addition the palm rejection is also unpredictable as it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Even changing it manually still doesn't work reliably.</p>

      <h4>Quick sketch, 4 stars (Sketchoid, Apple App Store, 2015-06-17)</h4>
      <p>This app is good for quick sketches, but not for finished drawings.

I like that this app has different color "paper" books, and it does work well with the Wacom stylus.

That being said, I really wish there was more variety in the tools available. There is no option to change the opacity of the drawing tools, and no color mixer.</p>

      <h4>When could you support copy/paste function?, 4 stars (Puriney, Apple App Store, 2015-06-07)</h4>
      <p>Bamboo Paper beats Penultimate because: 
1. it runs smoothly without any delay. 
2. by default it has two kinds of pen. 
3. default color are elegant. 
One important feature I highly want and I am happy to pay for is: copy/paste function, so that I can copy contents from the page and paste to somewhere else.</p>

      <p>Very clean and precise app. Couple suggestions: 

1. Let me change the paper per page, instead of the whole notebook. 
2. Let me choose the folder Evernote uploads go to, or have them go to my default, but not the created Bamboo folder.</p>

      <h4>Great for sketching, 4 stars (Johweedee, Apple App Store, 2015-06-01)</h4>
      <p>For light sketching, this app is growing on me. I can see this replacing Paper in some cases because of the pressure sensitivity.  The different papers and sketchbook styles are cool, especially the storyboarding one.  

I would love to see a simple layers setup, or perhaps something like tracing paper, and it NEEDS a better eraser. A soft edged pressure-based opacity would make this even better.  I often want to erase in a soft way, like an actual eraser.  I also wish the pencil had a little bit of size variation with the pressure, not just opacity.

The draw to this app for me is ease of use + natural drawing experience.  Bamboo Paper currently does better at the former than the latter.  Looking forward to future updates!</p>

      <p>Pluses: easy and fun to use; don't need an actual stylus (though that helps at times).
Minuses: could use a text option. Other than that, none significant.</p>

      <p>Had a horrific time getting to sync app with stylus. Cannot rest hand on tablet. Point might as well be 3miles from actual place on tablet. I say 3miles because much like Three Mile Island, aka TMI, this app is a disaster of the nuclear kind! Plus it disabled other drawing/sketching apps I have on my iPad. Not worth the trouble/headache!</p>

      <p>This app should offer a way to send notes out into other app such as one note. I also believe it should give options for what type of paper you would like to write on.

      <p>I have recently bought the ICS2 and this is the first app I have gotten to connect with it.

This may be Apples fault, but if you can, please fix this.</p>

      <p>This app claims to be tightly integrated with the Bamboo stylus but it's not.  The lines are created to the right of where the stylus is positioned. This makes for correcting a letter or number impossible. The app needs to have a better "edit options" ability to select the "ignore wrist" feature. It also lacks a screen calibration feature. The stylus is bluetooth enabled but only to apps that are designed to pair with it within their app systems only and not through the iOS default settings, this is confusing. I was looking for something that works, instead I was disappointed.</p>
