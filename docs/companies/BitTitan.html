Document Libraries were missing THOUSANDS of files on the target." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1868y49/bittitan_customer_service_refusing_refund_on/lda6gk3/">(sjackson0109, Reddit, 2024-07-15)</a></li>

<li>"BitTitan has a known issue where they limit the total processing allowed for a SharePoint site. This may be a result of a large number of files, total size of files, depth of folder structure, etc. ... NONE OF THIS IS DOCUMENTED ... THERE IS NO WARNING." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/twqa1c/it_bittitans_support_always_incompetent_or_am_i/imldc15/">(JKatabaticWind, Reddit, 2022-08-31)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Historical Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>"BitTitan used to be really good. Now they are crap, with so many backend issues leading to data loss and outsourcing ALL of their support to places that admittedly have not been trained on their product." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1254mfe/warning_about_using_bittitan_for_office_365/je2qfsv/">(St0nywall, Reddit, 2023-03-28)</a></li>
