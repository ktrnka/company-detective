<li>"I hate them. That's a strong statement for an IT software vendor but their product is absolute garbage and their support is horrid." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1diuybl/another_rant_yes_bittitan_migration_wiz_does_suck/l96lzr0/">(MalletSwinging, Reddit, 2024-06-18)</a></li>

<h3>Product Issues</h3>
