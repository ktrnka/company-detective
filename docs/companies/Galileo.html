        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>COMPANY Galileo</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I've been using it for a while. Satisfied with the results. Make sure to join their fb group where more experienced users share their settings. Saved me a lot of time instead of trial &amp; error." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/ik07ury/">(Ok_Artichoke4822, Reddit, 2022-08-12)</a></li>
<li>"I just recently started using Galileo FX. I am just new to the product and I don't know how to install and use it at first. I contacted their support and they remotely connected to my PC to help me until my Galileo FX was set up and running. Since then, I have gained more than 40% profit, unlike before. I'm getting used to it now. I'm even earning a profit while sleeping. If you want to earn a profit, I highly suggest buying Galileo FX." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/indahwp/">(jamieMSP69, Reddit, 2022-09-06)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Cautionary Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I've had a good run with Galileo FX, but it's important to remember that past performance doesn't necessarily predict future results. The forex market can be quite volatile, and even with the bot's risk management features, there's always a chance of losing your investment." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/k451wo7/">(Alex_FX_, Reddit, 2023-10-09)</a></li>
<li>"It's definitely not a 'get rich quick' scheme but with patience, you can yield decent profits." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/jsc45pq/">(Affectionate-Bug3314, Reddit, 2023-07-17)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Negative types expect instant success so as soon they turn the bot on. Of course they are disappointed." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/lk7rz07/">(Specific_Top_4496, Reddit, 2024-08-27)</a></li>
<li>"I can promise you it’s just not closing losing trades until they hit the take profit." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/wbvkg4/anyone_still_using_galileo_fx_ea/ii92tsd/">(idonthaveanamehelp, Reddit, 2022-07-30)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>PRODUCT Galileo</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Galileo AI is pretty versatile - handles both mobile and web designs. Works well with Figma and gives you code you can actually use." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/">(Safe-Guidance4066, Reddit, 2024-12-12)</a></li>
<li>"Even if you're not a designer, you can edit stuff through chat, though you need to be pretty clear about what you want to change." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/">(Safe-Guidance4066, Reddit, 2024-12-12)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Galileo AI produces decent results." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/1ah8r2g/are_there_any_free_ai_tools_available_for/lg7px1s/">(Schoolwaterdarling, Reddit, 2024-08-02)</a></li>
<li>"They don't do well in editing but you can export to Figma and edit it there." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1arxxxg/d_how_do_you_train_generative_ai_for_ui_design/kxzoijw/">(Ok_Ice5420, Reddit, 2024-04-04)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Used this product. It is hot shit. Will output a few decent designs then I am sure they pass off allocation of resources once you sign up and pay. Very quickly you will see the designs deteriorate and the AI will just stop taking input commands and generate designs (wasting credits) without making changes." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/10y2un4/new_ai_tool_called_galileo_that_will_deliver/m950dur/">(Sanfrancisco_Tribe, Reddit, 2025-01-25)</a></li>
<li>"The AI can only generate components to a certain degree of complexity. It seems like it has access to static components it can slightly change inputs to render outputs, but beyond that it can't." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/10y2un4/new_ai_tool_called_galileo_that_will_deliver/m950dur/">(Sanfrancisco_Tribe, Reddit, 2025-01-25)</a></li>
<li>"Not worth the money." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/10y2un4/new_ai_tool_called_galileo_that_will_deliver/m950dur/">(Sanfrancisco_Tribe, Reddit, 2025-01-25)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison with Other Products</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Galileo and UIzard have not been helpful to me as they don't follow the prompt properly compared to the above tools." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/product_design/comments/1hcj56d/ai_product_design_tools_comparisons_v0_bolt/mg4cnzc/">(arpitashinde, Reddit, 2025-03-05)</a></li>
