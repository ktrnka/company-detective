      <p>My favorite and most used app on my phone.. I can only give 1 star though, forcing ads into my messages is so ridiculous and unnecessary. You have ads between friends stories, every like 5 to 10 seconds in every single video.. Throwing ads in my messages, moving people around, causing me to send things to the wrong people, that's trash.. you're about a step or 2 away from just being an ad app. Fix it</p>

      <h4>Increasingly intrusive adds and forced arbitration, 2 stars (16joshH, Apple App Store, 2025-03-26)</h4>
      <p>Snapchat used to be tame with regards to apps. But now they’re masking them as normal snaps and messages. There’s often a slight delay between when you open the messages page and when the the add loads as your first message. This often makes you accidentally click the add instead of the first real snap, which seems like a dark pattern.

The terms of service also make you agree to forced arbitration unless you email snap directly. Combined with the fact that they’ll gladly save and use your data, it’s a classic big-tech scummy anti-consumer move.</p>

      <p>I had enjoyed Snapchat for years. However, the cost associated with using the app could be considerable. A woman I knew, in high school, over 10 years ago sent me a late night Snapchat. I went to meet her for an impromptu reunion (I was her booty call). This led to us being together for 5 years, engaged and have a baby together. So yes, this app has cost me thousands of dollars but has given me millions in memories.</p>

      <h4>They Do Not Care, 1 stars (liquidgeuse, Apple App Store, 2025-03-25)</h4>
      <p>I have used Snapchat for over a decade at this point. And I do love how I am able to communicate with my friends and family super easily, keep them up to date, sent pictures. But I have been locked out of my beloved first account because there is no customer service whatsoever to help me, so it makes my heart ache..I have photos of my baby brother on there! 
 All to say, I know I have photos that I would love to see again, but Snapchat provides zero support in retrieving an account. 
I honestly had let that go, but now that they are sending ads as Snapchats, I am fed up. I want my memories back and I want to continue to use the app to communicate with my friends and family. The in app ads are becoming too much.</p>
