      <p>Edited to add, many months later and I still can't open the following or discover stories. Literally nothing happens when I tap it. Finally deleting this app. It's not even worth being able to keep up with friends because they put the same thing on their Instagram stories and it actually works. There is an ad after every single story and I can't even open the other stories, I tap and nothing happens. Very sad when you think about how long this app as been running.</p>

      <p>Hey Snapchat chill out on the notifications you dont have to always have something or 10 somethings in my notifications it's getting ridiculous as soon as i clear one another comes in immediately and i dont need the same suggestions multiple times a day/week there's a reason i haven't added them. You are abusing the notification privilege knock it off.</p>

      <p>My Snapchat I’ve had since 2018 had been locked out. Snap said I was violating community guidelines but I never did. Now I can use the app at all. there are so many users posting drugs, alc, s*x and other things. I posted myself and my friends and now I’m basically banned. This app is really trash and I’ve asked for help form Snapchat but they denied everything. Why would I have it for so long to lose it? makes no sense. All my pictures, friends and videos are all gone now. Snapchat doesn’t really look into any problem besides just kicking you off</p>

      <p>I don’t think snap chat should tell you that you have to many friends and you can’t add anymore people. As many people who want to add a person they should have that right. Other then that I think that Snapchat should have a better filtering system cause a lot of people on there is selling s@x and spamming people. I think there should also be an option to turn off calling so people can’t just blow up your phone with spam calls</p>

      <p>I really enjoyed using Snapchat for over 11 years (basically since its inception) oneday in like august 2024 I decided to create a public profile and began posting a ton of my food content and gained around 5,000 followers. I never posted anything other than food. FOOD lol. Somehow I am able to continue posting for around 2 months and in October I get Permanently locked out of my account citing "violation of user agreement" huh? For what exactly? I submitted over 50 appeals to Snapchat and went back and forth with their zen desk "help" absolutely nothing. No help, no ethics and most of all no regard for the countless amounts of people who use Snapchat to communicate with friends and family for years on end only to ban them with zero warning. I would caution anyone thinking about creating a Snapchat to give your data to someone else. Unfortunately this company MAJORLY lacks ethics and any respect to consumer laws and rights.</p>

      <p>When snapping my friends, we often send long videos to each other in the personal chats because it’s faster than typing/hands are busy/etc. but now, Snapchat is making you click EACH. INDIVIDUAL. VIDEO. and will just infinitely reply the one you’re currently watching ON LOOP until you click. It’s driving me insane and has made the app a huge hassle. If I’m not paying perfect attention to what the video sounds like at the start, I’ll wind up rewatching half until I catch it. You get so focused on trying to catch the snap at the right time to switch to the next that paying attention to the words is practically impossible. JUST DO THE AUTOPLAY!! IT’S NOT THAT HARD!!

      <p>Every update is worse than the last. Why do you think it’s okay to auto brighten my phone? The app is almost unusable half the time because it’s brightens my screen why up when I have the brightness all the way down in my settings. It’s extremely obnoxious when it’s nighttime or darker in a room. STOP. Also take the AI off of my screen. It’s creepy and I don’t want to use it yet somehow the app glitches constantly and makes me press on the stupid my AI. I also blocked team Snapchat ages ago and removed them from my conversation list and now somehow they’re back on the list, and I can’t remove them and I get some random, obnoxious, unnecessary message multiple times a week now. STOP. Stop forcing me to use features that I don’t like and don’t want. Stop auto brightening my screen. I don’t need my phone at full brightness in the dark!!!</p>

      <h4>Snapchat Veteran Here | Bug Needs Fixing, 4 stars (Millennial Snapchat Veteran, Apple App Store, 2024-09-30)</h4>
      <p>I’ve used Snapchat for years. It’s me and my friends way of keeping in touch with others and also read articles during our free time. 

I’ve also been through all the major updates and shared a love-hate relationship through it all. After a while, I got used to the change lol.

Anyways, that being said, I am a Snapchat Veteran and have saved tons of snaps to my Snapchat memories throughout the years. 

But there’s times where I don’t want to see the memories anymore. Even after permanently deleting the snaps in memories, it never actually deletes! It comes back. And again. And again. 

If there is something I ask to be changed, I want this problem to be fixed. Minus one star, as I personally think this is issue is something that should have been addressed and solved a while ago along with multiple updates happening.

Otherwise, I recommend this app if you also have friends who are active on it as well.</p>

      <p>So I had this old account that I used to use but i switched over to my new, current account like 2 years ago. I guess finally that old account got hacked and somehow it violated the community guidelines, so Snapchat banned my whole device. I didn’t do anything wrong on my main account, but I guess since I had that old account still saved on the log in screen, it didn’t care and banned the whole device. I don’t understand why I have to be punished and never use Snapchat again when I didn’t even do anything wrong.</p>

Me and my boyfriend are each other’s number one best friend, so we have the “besties” mark. However, it’s been over two months and it hasn’t changed even to the “two weeks” mark. I’m not sure what’s going on with it, as it’s not the only issue. I can also only scroll to a certain point until it stops and spins. It goes to the bottom of my list of people (who I haven’t snapped in years) before friends that I messaged months ago. I have to search half my friends up. Don’t get me wrong, I love Snapchat. It’s a great form of communication. However, I’ve just been having issues the past few months.</p>

Snapchat has ruined their services by pushing things you can’t opt out of, and hiding things behind pay walls. Their social media feed is also very toxic and displays images that are not healthy for children.</p>

      <p>Snapchat has always been my go-to app for quick and fun communication with friends. The recent updates have brought back the beloved normal characters, which is a definite plus. The app's quality is top-notch, ensuring a smooth experience when using it. However, the removal of games has left a void in the overall experience. The games were a great way to pass the time and added an extra layer of entertainment to the app. I hope Snapchat considers bringing them back in the future. Another downside is the dependency on wifi for optimal performance. Without a strong wifi connection, the app's quality can suffer, leading to delays and glitches. Overall, Snapchat remains a fun and engaging platform despite these drawbacks. I would highly recommend it for its communication features and interactive elements, with the hope that improvements continue to enhance the user experience.</p>

I’ve never posted nor even done drugs in my life. I can only assume Snapchat is “woke” and banned me for my political views. Shared a couple non pro Kamala snaps and they banned me the day of the debate. How odd. Snap chat is ran by a bunch of woke crybaby liberals. Bet if I posted anti Trump tiktoks, I would still have my account.</p>

      <p>bro my account was wrongfully banned for absolutely zero reason, you guys haven’t answered any of my emails are for months!!! AND YOU GUYS ARE NOT LETTING ME DOWNLOAD MY 10 years worth of MEMORIES, that’s actually outrageous. Why do you guys have a email support ssystem if you never ever reply to any emails? I have contacted you guys on ever way possible, email, twitter, TikTok, instagram, etc. I keep getting automated responses through Snapchat support. My account was hacked and wrongfully made inaccessible as there was a malfunction with Snapchats software in detecting a breach in Snapchat rules. My account was locked for absolutely no reason July 20th. I belive this was a malfunction because I was not active and did not send post or take a picture of anything for the entire month of June. I have had 0 prior breaches. So with no prior breaches my account was locked and gone. I’ve had this account for about 6 years and have never done anything wrong. It went indefinitely inaccessible within seconds. With no opportunity to log in even tho the email I got it said that this was just a warning. I’ve had to reach to you guys through any means necessary. I know people who post stuff against drug/alcohol guidelines and they still have there account so I just feel like this is completely unfair. If there is anyway you guys could help review the breach to prove I did nothing wrong and did not breach the rules I would greatly appreciate it. I don’t want to lose my account and years worth of memories, friends, photos, and videos that I will not be able to get back. I know this exact thing has happened to many people before so I’m hoping you guys can help me out. PLEASE.</p>

      <p>I think snapchat is a great app, you can do lots of things on it as in making new friends, finding your friends by just searching up their name, and it’s just great to have it around, there are lots of great features too as in streaks, pinned , and best friend list. You should definitely download Snapchat if you would like to be able to text and send pictures in one conversation.</p>

And then I find out that I CAN delete it, but I have to subscribe to the nonsense that is Snapchat+!!!
From what I’ve heard, NO ONE loves like feature. Is this what Snapchat is going to do now? Adding features that people hate just to make it so they have to pay to remove it?</p>

      <p>You cannot disable AI unless you pay more. Snapchat (the chat) keeps recommending I use my AI avatar, which I am unable to block or unfriend. The AI has also, unprompted by me, edited my photos from snapchat memories and re-suggests them to me. Very creepy, very violating. I did not consent or ask it to do any of that. But maybe it's a fine-print thing. Either way I hate the way AI is being forced into most social media without the option to remove it.</p>

      <p>I have never once written a review for an app before so this goes to show how fed up I am with Snapchat. You guys need to stop finding ways of creating useless and excessive notifications for your users. All I want is to be notified if someone snaps or messages me. That’s IT, and every couple of weeks I get spammed with random and useless notifications like “Flashback highlight!!” that I then have to go in and turn off notifications for. It'd be fine if this happened occasionally but I find myself going into my settings on snap and turning off an annoying new way that Snapchat found to send notifications way too frequently —honestly more times than I use the app at this point</p>

      <p>All I see on Snapchat is woke left wing garbage. It’s 100% political based and ALWAYS includes sexual perversion. They glorify extreme lgbtq ideas and PROMOTE it. They try to hook you on garbage so that you stop thinking for yourself and forget about what really matters. If you wanna talk to someone just text them, call them, or hang out with them. This app is no longer focused on meeting new people but rather to corrupt your values and beliefs. They promote what “feels/sounds” good to the mainstream media, rather than promoting the truth. I cannot emphasize enough how much you should not have app. Don’t download it, and if you have it, delete it.</p>

      <h4>Don’t try and change a good thing, 1 stars (V. Eryn, Apple App Store, 2024-09-26)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been a Snapchat user for probably over a decade now, and I can honestly say I used to love going on there and posting stories, using filters and communicating with others. The app as it is currently is frustrating to use other than chatting. First of all, the AI feature; I have no interest in using it whatsoever. but there is not an option for me to get rid of the AI bot. Not only that, it doesn’t matter what friends I have pinned to the top of my chats, the AI bot will “jump” to the top as I tap on my top pinned friend, forcing me to open a chat with it. 

Second of all, I am absolutely sick of getting messages over two times a day every single day from team Snapchat. there is no way to delete the chats that open, the messages themselves are not relevant to anything useful or fun inside of the app, and feels like the equivalent of email spam. 

Third, I will only touch on lightly, because I haven’t even really tried to use the filter feature in over two years at this point. The filters are basically unusable outside of the suggested ones within the first couple of options on the camera. previously, I remember being able to search filters and share filters with people, and the relatively easy to use search page. The app features for being able to speed up a video, slow it down, distort voices, etc was also one of my favorites to use in my daily snaps and stories; but since things have changed, I have no idea if those are even options anymore, and honestly don’t care enough to try anymore.

My fourth, in at most complaint, I will say, is the blatant promotion of soft porn on the public stories page. I have literally spent hours hiding and blocking stories and hitting not interested on as many of these as I can and STILL they persist. it wasn’t even that long ago when the stories on that public page were educational, fun and family friendly. I followed accounts like nat geo, stay tuned, etc that had a more interesting, positive, and educational focus, and now I hardly ever see content from those accounts or see anything similar suggested in my feed. I understand that “sex sells,” but The amount of advertisement, influence, and downright inappropriate content that comes across several social media platforms downright screams predatory. I can only imagine the amount of minors, recovering addicts, and relationships this predatory algorithm and practice has harmed.

TLDR: this app used to be fun to use beyond communication, but now is an annoying reminder of how dysfunctional and dystopian our society has become.</p>

      <p>snapchat used to be elite, the ability to text and send photos quickly and also be able to store those within the app is great. I simply HATE your new design with AI, if you insist that every single app in the new era is required to have some form of “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE” it should be optional since living, breathing humans are able to gain intelligence of real substance. I despise that your AI program is supposed to be some kind of a “friend”. Its in the way, its useless, its boring, ITS FAKE and no one wants it there. MOVE AI OR GET RID OF IT. matter of fact make it a premium feature since no one wants snapchat plus either.

      <h4>Snapchat should add the multi snap function back, 4 stars (azu123kr, Apple App Store, 2024-09-25)</h4>
      <p>Snapchat is a fun and engaging platform that stands out with its unique features like Stories, Snap Map, and creative filters. The ephemeral nature of messages adds an interesting twist, making interactions feel spontaneous and private. I especially enjoy the wide range of filters and lenses that keep things entertaining.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. The app occasionally feels cluttered with too many features, and the navigation isn’t always intuitive for new users. Ads can also be a bit intrusive at times. Also i would like to have the multi snap option back.

Overall, Snapchat remains a great app for quick, fun communication, and its innovations in augmented reality keep it relevant. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a playful social experience.

Feel free to adjust this to better fit your personal experience!</p>

The appeal is gonna take 30 days and I’ve had streaks that are 200+, because of this I’m risking losing all memories, and if the appeal is denied my account will be deleted</p>

      <p>Snapchat was a great thing for me. I could talk to my friends, but one of my friends said that I was going to hurt him and reported that as a joke to TeamSnap and they permanently lock my account for no reason they didn’t have evidence so that’s why I hate snap. They can fix it. Thank you. It’s been a month.</p>

      <h4>Deleted For no reason, 1 stars (Rilee2020, Apple App Store, 2024-09-24)</h4>
      <p>Woke up all morning to several messages from people asking if I blocked them and I went to Snapchat and open the app and it said login and sign up because I had been logged out of my account. I tried to get back into my account, but it says something along the lines of cannot login due to suspicious activity and to try using a different number, even though I was never active on my account when it was deleted, and I even asked friends if they saw anything posted that may have been posted by a hacker and nothing was posted. I have so many memories on Snapchat and so many saved and chats that I’m not sure I’m going to be able to retrieve back and I’m mad about the fact I didn’t do anything. My whole account is gone. I’ve searched multiple things about my situation and it’s gone from wait a couple minutes to wait a couple hours to wait 42 hours to wait 72 hours to wait two weeks to wait six months. I’ve contacted Snapchat so many times and they just sent me an auto generated email every time that has nothing to do with my situation. Just terrible customer service and help. I love Snapchat, but I don’t understand how they can just take my account away I haven’t done anything</p>

      <p>there is a very high chance you will be randomly banned and not told the reason why. going to there help and support page is useless at most because it just tells you that you can’t get your account banned, and if your device banned good luck spending money on another phone just to use the app. it’s a great app to connect with friends and family but you can’t get banned for anything at anytime and not be able to know what you did and or why u were banned.</p>

And now, not only am I getting those again and but I also keep getting notifications about how I need to “hurry to save on Snapchat plus” I do not want these notifications. I do not want to pay for anything on an app that has been free for the last 12 years. There’s absolutely nothing about Snapchat plus that makes me want to spend the little money I do have on extra features. I do not want random videos from team Snapchat about things I don’t care about. Fix this. I have never left a review before but I’m over it</p>

      <h4>"Snapchat's Hidden War on Creators: A Journey of Frustration and Decline", 1 stars (The Expert Abdo, Apple App Store, 2024-09-23)</h4>
      <p>I used to post on Instagram but grew frustrated with their platform for numerous reasons. So, I decided to move to Snapchat, introducing my followers to a platform they weren’t familiar with. My audience trusts me, so I successfully transitioned hundreds of thousands of followers over to Snapchat. Looking back, I wish I hadn’t done that.

Once you reach a certain level on Snapchat, the platform starts to work against you. It deliberately removes your followers without their consent, making it hard for people to find you. Worse yet, Snapchat intentionally reduces your views, seemingly without reason or transparency.

There’s absolutely no clarity in how they operate. It’s as if the management is purposely trying to destroy a platform already burdened with financial issues. When you share any link with your followers, they severely punish you by cutting your views in half, even though all your views are from your direct followers, not from Explore.

I’ve been struggling with these issues for the past eight years. Now, I feel stuck — I can’t just start fresh on a new platform and build everything from scratch again, but I also can’t continue with Snapchat the way things are.

One thing is clear: those running Snapchat will face accountability for their actions. This app will not succeed in the long run and seems destined to collapse. The management is not running things in a natural or fair way.

This captures the essence of your frustration with Snapchat based on the details you provided.</p>

Safety Concerns
Snapchat's ephemeral nature can make it difficult for parents and authorities to monitor and address harmful or illegal content, such as cyberbullying, sexting, or child pornography. This lack of accountability puts users, especially minors, at risk.

 Privacy Issues
Snapchat collects sensitive user data, including location, contacts, and usage habits. This data can be vulnerable to hacking and exploitation, compromising users' privacy.

Addictive Design
Snapchat's design encourages excessive usage, potentially harming mental health and productivity. Features like streaks and trophies foster competition and anxiety.

Promotion of Harmful Content
Snapchat has faced criticism for allowing or promoting harmful content, including hate speech, racism, and harmful challenges.

Negative Impact on Youth 
Snapchat can negatively impact youth by promoting unrealistic expectations, body image issues, and peer pressure.</p>
