      <p>Today, my snap memories were rude 1s but they were funny so I forwarded them on to a few close friends because they would have found them funny. As soon as I forwarded them snapchat has logged me out and banned and deleted my account..I find this frustrating .if snapchat had a an issue with these pictures why did they display them in my memories? I think this is totally unfair. I have had my snapchat account for over 8 years and the memories are sentimental .I want my account back</p>

      <p>Videos from my memories still never play through, they always stop and load half a dozen times before I actually get to watch the whole thing. That's not new, no update fixes it so I just continue force quitting until they work. HowEVER, the newest and by far MOST irritating thing Snap now does is inundated me with spam. On a daily basis I'm getting snap after snap from people I don't know, have never viewed and have no reason to be showing up in my feed. Snap completely ignores my reports.</p>

      <p>It would be nice to recieve and be notified that I got a snap right away instead of 2 hours after, if I'm notified at all. I have deleted and reinstalled the app numerous times and checked all of my settings. It started happening after an update months ago. Very frustrating!</p>

      <p>Let me ban discover stories and this is 5 stars. I can't ban annoying creators. I just chat with friends, store your photos or videos, and let you post to the public and private sector. Snapchat has been pushing all the features that make using this despicable. 5 second Ads every 5-30 seconds. My feed isn't being fed. Creators I hide/block keep popping back up. This is ridiculous Tldr: don't use this unless you'd need to. I'd uninstall but too much of my friends and business is here.</p>

Your "bug fix" messed everything up. An actual fix would be nice. You want us to watch the shorts on here, but make it extremely annoying with the ads. I understand ads are necessary, but every 10 seconds is sooooo ridiculous!</p>

      <h4>Privacy concerns, 1 stars (sophieserenity, Apple App Store, 2025-02-02)</h4>
      <p>Why can't I turn off the option to have a public profile? I don't use Snapchat for that and I keep accidentally clicking add to public story when trying to upload to my private story. There needs to be an option to enable that... This feels like a privacy violation. I've used Snapchat since it came out and I really miss the simplicity.</p>

      <p>Snapchat is a good app the only things are that when you’re watching something ad can mysteriously just pop up mid watching it and another is that you can’t pause it to read something when it goes really fast</p>

      <h4>Awful Support, 1 stars (Mason Pastore, Apple App Store, 2025-02-02)</h4>
      <p>The support from this app is terrible. If you try to write them in the app then they send the same automated options every time, which most of the time don’t relate to your issue. I have also sent them numerous emails and they all send the same automated message there too. They don’t even answer your follow up emails. Don’t even bother contacting them if you have an issue. They also leave out information about certain features which caused my problem.</p>

      <h4>Bugs, privacy issue, and cosmetics, 1 stars (savannah141414, Apple App Store, 2025-01-29)</h4>
      <p>I’ve used snap for years now. Classic app. I love to document my life to my friends on my private story. However I feel the quality of Snapchat has significantly gone down. My biggest fear kind of came true in a sense. A long video I posted to my very private story bugged out and a bunch of people (who I’m not friends with or some kind of bot) viewed it. I’ve known others who have had the same issue as well. I think that is a major breach of privacy as a user, if your ability to contain information is that compromised then you need some major fixing. To top it off, what I’ve felt for years is with every update the worse and more buggy it gets. It’s no longer a smooth looking app, it’s kind of ugly, with unnecessary cosmetic updates that no one asked for. I feel like they really need to ask an audience of their users what updates they would like to see, rather than pushing out whatever comes out of their a**. Thank you for reading and I hope somehow snap chat sees this too because I’m upset.</p>
