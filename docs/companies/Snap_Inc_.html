        <h1>About Snap Inc.</h1>
<p>Snap Inc. is an American technology company founded on September 16, 2011, by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Originally named Snapchat Inc., it rebranded to Snap Inc. on September 24, 2016, to reflect its broader product offerings, which include Spectacles and Bitmoji <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Inc.">(Wikimedia, 2016)</a>.</p>
<p>Snap Inc. is primarily known for its flagship product, Snapchat, a multimedia messaging app that allows users to send photos and videos that disappear after being viewed.

      <p>I UNINSTALLED this app today. EVERY time I had to watch a Snapchat ad while using another app on my phone, the ad would open the Snapchat app. It's bad enough I was already using the Snapchat app, but then an ad for Snapchat would open the Snapchat app while I was using another app. 7 MONTHS LATER, IT'S STILL A PROBLEM.</p>

It was great all the way up till today August 2024 now when I go to look back at my memories it immediately acts like I want to edit it. And I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Please fix it. Edit as of October 2024. It hasn't been fixed. December 2024 I no longer have sound when I get notifications.</p>

      <p>Used to be good. Now, sometimes I type something long out and then find that Snapchat decided to place my text below the "send to X" line, since I cannot click it to move it higher into frame, I am then required me to type out the whole thing again. Also, Team Snapchat decided that they wanted to advertise in their messages to us, and make them impossible to block. Even when muted I still get notifications. This is ridiculous and unacceptable.</p>

      <p>snapchat was great in the beginning. if i wanted to see somebody else’s stories i would have them added as a friend. i don’t want all these random people i don’t know stories showing up all the times it’s so irritating. and if i wanted to know when one of my friends posted a story i would have the notifications on. why do i get a notification for every single person in my friends list when they post a story. it makes the app so irritating to even have. every person ive talked to is about one more bad update away from completely removing the app from their phone. everyone i know has cancelled snapchat premium because it’s gotten SO bad.</p>

      <p>My nana who I rarely get to talk to because of her sickness snapped me today, I opened it more than excited. Just to find out that it was just an add made to look like she sent me a snap. I’m heartbroken and disappointed. On top of that you can’t watch any reels longer than 1 and a half minutes without having 5 adds (some being unskippable) interrupt the video. ON TOP OF THAT this app seems like it’s becoming a hot spot for OF models and it’s starting to become extremely annoying. 

If it wasn’t for my sentimental convos that I have with important people close to me, I would have deleted this money hungry app long ago. I hate Snapchat.</p>

Just bring options that would be limited to kids under 18 cause every platform does same please work on that for us please thank you

I wish there was a way to not receive messages from Team Snapchat regarding updates and holidays. I also wish we had the option to take away the AI option. Even if I delete them both, they all come back eventually. Also the tabloid discover pages are really annoying. Most of them are complete lies and just click bait.

      <p>Alright so Snapchat is a great app it seems like but it’s just dumb how u have to $ to get better stuff than everyone else. I’m just not gonna pay monthly for a dumb app. I hope you would not either. The reason is because what app is going to charge that much for “premium” I personally think it’s not worth it at all.  Because what’s the point in buying premium. Also why would they take away the GAMES. The games were personally my favorite part about Snapchat but then they got rid of them. I’m not happy Snapchat used to be my favorite app I’m 27 I got it when I was 14 and I think it was a lot better when I was younger. Another thing is when you send photos they don’t show up more than twice and I think both my kids are hiding something in the photos they send to their “friends”. I think Snapchat could use a lot of things to improve. If I made an app it would probably be better than Snapchat. This review is written by Ella.</p>

      <p>Snapchat was where we all would keep our childhood memories in one place. Now it’s a filthy advertising and profit hungry platform that wants nothing more then to take your money. It started with Snapchat Premium and the Bitmoji cosmetics, which is somewhat tolerable, but now they allow companies to directly send you ads in your messages. This is shameful. Not to mention the most annoying updates from steam Snap which are UNBLOCKABLE! The new AI has the IQ of a rock and can’t help with anything you ask of it. Snapchat now does this new thing where they send you phantom notifications (like the red number on the top right of the app before you open it) just to make you open the app. And these new content pages NOBODY ASKED FOR that’s clearly only there to trap people into viewing things for the sole purpose of creator revenue. Plus the forced follows of these creators that NOBODY ASKED FOR. I can’t believe how far this app as fallen.</p>

      <p>honestly it’s not a bad app. I’ve had it for a year and noticed only minor problems. one of the rules being that you can only change your birthday once. I had to change my bday bc I put the wrong month and since then (it’s been over a year since I’ve done that) I cannot change my birth year to get a public profile. I contacted Snapchat support because the app claims that you can change your birthday a limited amount of times but doesn’t list the amount of times (you can only change it once). I never got the public profile. Another thing I found interesting was the ai. It’s lowkey creepy and it’s the only “friend” you can’t block it. Other than those concerns, I don’t think the app is horrible from my experience. I’d rate it a 3.5/5</p>

      <p>Snap I am writing this to inform you of what is happening. There are accounts of people using the neon filter and doing things. Like tickling themselves and it is horrible. There are entire accounts and yes I reported them but I tried to enjoy the app but you failed. I had to delete it to the sheer amount out those things I saw and it was horrible. You need to ban these videos and accounts but sadly the filter people have done it one too many times and it has been ruined. They are literally promoting the real unfiltered things to buy. Yo have to ban Neon Lines the filter completely there are kids on the app and sadly they have to see that. As a app you need to do better. To wrap it up, Delete neon lines filter, ban every video and account. If you do many more people will have a much more fun experience on the app instead what I had and sadly to many people have had what I had so please ban these accounts and the filter.</p>

      <p>I’ve been using Snapchat for over a decade and as many may like the recent updates the majority of us do not! Snapchat has always been a favored app amongst us teens. Unfortunately as of recently all the new changes have stripped a lot away from the app. We no longer have the privacy or freedom that we used to like remixing a snap without the other person being notified. As well as having remixed snaps appear as media uploads when we’re too lazy to take snaps. A lot has changed that shouldn’t have. I found myself reaching for it way less than I used to due to all these recent updates I hope they can bring these features back!</p>

Now you cant even block the ‘Team Snapchat’ so im getting at least 3 notifications a month that i care nothing about. 

Pushing your useless junk surprisingly worsens the platform not improve. Whod have guessed.</p>

      <p>This application (just like most social media platforms) caters to the censorship of free speech. It supports abominations like LGBTQ, but censors people who speak out against homosexuality. Also, if the devs deem they "dont like" the content you post (non nudity or misinformation being exposed) they will decide to just report your account, tell you what a naughty person you've been through email, and give you a little slap on the wrist. They have gone from being like X platform 11 years ago, to woke little babes who like when others post things such as hunting, or other educational videos. Basically, if you are a pro life conservative with an opinion, they will try to ban you.</p>
