      <p>An account I’ve had for 6 years has been deleted in error due to AI sensoring not understanding the way a human would. My account was banned for “drug related activity” because I put the title to a song, which I was singing in the video that got my account locked, as the caption in my video. The technology that tries to sensor and prevent drug related activities believed I was attempting to distribute drugs instead of captioning the name of the song I was singing in the video. I really hope somehow the censoring can be managed by humans. I think using robots is cutting corners especially if they’re not the kind who comprehend basic human interaction and behavior. 6 years of memories gone since snap team can’t hire real humans. Never using this app again.</p>

      <p>If you’re underage and have Snapchat or are looking into getting it. Be warned about the honeytoon ads, they are bait to send you/your child to an inappropriate comic website. In the last week I’ve counted over 45+ times of seeing those ads. I don’t know how many times Ive pressed the “dont show me this ad” button but they keep popping up. Highly disappointed with where this app is going and it’d be better off proclaiming itself as a s*xual content app.</p>

      <p>Snap plus  should be able to decrease your snap score because if u want to double it some may want to decrease theirs. Also you should make it so that regular users can change the app icon I don’t think that I would pay money just to do what snap plus features have now my opinion you should make it so that snap plus members can decrease their snap score and customize more things like the app background and not just the bottom taskbar. I think you would benefit from adding more features and you should take this into consideration.</p>

Every time i open the app and try to go to a conversation i get kicked out and it restarts. i searched up what could be causing this and it said my storage space, so i got rid of 300 items, still didn’t work. I also can’t remove friends if the problem is i have too many friends on snap. I am using snapchat on a not updated ipad but it still says works on this ipad. I will try to fix it myself too but could you please take a look at my account and try and fix it? My user is @thepiperbeast. Thanks.</p>

The regular camera works perfectly fine. When I take a picture it’s blurry all around me and at night when i use flash for it. It uses a weird filter and makes me a lot whiter with a light green tint and I know there’s filter or portrait mode on because i don’t even have portrait mode on my snap. What do i need to do to fix this because it’s super annoying.</p>

      <h4>Why protect a non follower user privacy?, 2 stars (DoesntMS, Apple App Store, 2024-10-09)</h4>
      <p>The subscription+ is such a waste of time and not worth 3.99 monthly. I specifically paid for the subscription to check who be screenshotting my stories.
  For the features that are already included, ESPECIALLY for not including to show the username of who is screenshotting your public story.
 
 Why is Snapchat protecting the user from showing who exactly is screenshotting what I post on my public story.  Snapchat should let the user expose the username that is screenshotting and screen recording of an individual story. Thats honestly suspicious and could be danger to one safety for not knowing WHO is intentionally screenshot/recording.  Update your feature and privacy. This can be less frustrating if Snapchat wasn’t protecting the username privacy because they decide to screenshot someone Public story that they’re not following? Make it make sense.</p>

I need the music selection for snaps to able to skim through the whole song of whatever is being searched. Not the most viewed part of a song, or the first 50 seconds of a song. I had an idea for a funny snap featuring a song that went viral for being a meme and I can’t scroll to the part of the song that made it a meme in the first place. PLEASE add the ability to skim thru full songs like you can with instagram. And definitely DO NOT make that a Snapchat + feature 🫥 Especially when all other apps do it for free.</p>

My snap will always show me videos from up to 6 years ago now but it’s driving me crazy that it will bring them up and show me them ONE time and then they will remain a black nonmoving screen any other time I try to watch them. This has been happening for months now and it kills me to see such a happy memory and then I can’t even add it to my story or send it to a friend because it’s also gone just like that.

      <p>My account that had an OG badge from the year Snapchat was created got deleted because I posted yarrow on my story. A sacred plant that has no psychoactive affects. And then when I tried to appeal it they said my account belonged to someone underage and that it would be terminated. I’m almost 30. They didn’t even verify with me. Then when I reached out to the support team all I was left with was “Snapchat is busy and can’t get back to everyone. We may or may not be able to get back to you” Nearly a decade of pictures, videos, and memories gone. They won’t give me my data. They won’t answer me or unlock my account. Be careful if you’re using this app as a cloud for your pictures. They taking out tons of people for no good reason.</p>

Recently I was changing my profile background photo to a Greek statue of a naked lady I saw in Italy since I thought it was beautiful and I guess because Snapchat is automated and doesn’t recognize when something isn’t human. It started to glitch and delete my public profile because it thought I was breaking the guidelines so now I can’t create or get into my public profile. I’ve tried contacting Snapchat support for months now and they keep giving me the same response. That there looking into it even though they really aren’t. I’ve updated and deleted the app too and nothing. So disappointing honestly that this is happening to me. I never would’ve expected there tech support to be so behind.</p>

      <h4>Camera Issues, 4 stars (Moonwalker6800, Apple App Store, 2024-10-07)</h4>
      <p>I’ve had Snap for 1 month now, and I love it! Then one day I open it up and it says “Oops! Snapchat is a camera app. To continue, you’ll need to allow camera access in settings.” So I open settings, BUT THERE’S NO CAMERA ACCESS! So I became confused, did research, and there was nothing I could find to fix it. And I couldn’t even use any other feature in the app like texting, calling, or viewing stories and videos. This happened on October 7, 2024.

Thanks</p>

      <p>No one understand that there is a timer on videos as a default. Every SINGLE time someone posts something for me to read, THEY FORGET TO CHANGE IT TO UNLIMITED TIME. No ability to focus the camera—which is essential for taking picks of spiders. New updates have made it worse. From changing the size of the pic you wanna send—cutting off the edges—and doing that all after you hit send, to having videos not automatically play while you are trying to edit them. Who did you fire? Or who did you hire? Please bring someone around with a little intellect. Like, someone who wont change things that dont need to be changed, or at least someone who seems like they have used the app for a week. Update: now it wont stop notifying me about things i have turned off. I dont want you telling me to check my stories. STOP telling me when someone is typing. All i want is to know when i get a direct message. THAT IS IT. if one more thing starts pestering me im deleting this. This is the last social media i own. I dont do facebook, or any of that. Are you really going to bother me so bad that i give up my last connection to my childhood?</p>

Recently I’ve been getting unwanted notifications about people updating their stories and about friends featured in memories. I don’t want any of these notifications.

      <h4>Snapchat is pathetic!, 1 stars (Duale Jibril, Apple App Store, 2024-10-06)</h4>
      <p>I was device banned from Snapchat for sending joking stickers it is incredibly frustrating, especially when the intent was light-hearted. It’s concerning how a platform can impose such stringent actions without considering the context of user interactions. If playful engagement with stickers led to a ban, it raises questions about the platform's ability to differentiate between genuinely harmful behavior and harmless fun.
Moreover, the support provided by Snapchat in this situation appears to be lacking. Users expect fair treatment and responsive communication when issues arise, and it's disheartening when that support is inadequate. If there were an option to give zero stars, it would reflect the disappointment and lack of accountability in addressing user concerns. Such experiences highlight the importance of better moderation and customer support in digital platforms to foster a more positive environment for all users.</p>

There is no way to disable this new specific notification in the Snapchat app, so I just had to stop all notifications completely. I’m not letting this stupid app advertise their dumb subscription to me when I’m not even in the app. Show a pop-up ad when I open the app, fine. But don’t send me notifications with ads for your awful subscription service.</p>

      <p>I got my account permanently locked over a joke that I posted on my private story with MY prescription, Snapchat instantly locked my account. I submitted an appeal, waited 2 weeks and had it denied. There is no way to contact Snapchat, they do not care. I’ve had the app for 7 years now and lost so many contacts that I have no way of reaching and have never had an issue before this. Now I have half of the people I know think I blocked them and the other half think I’m an actual drug dealer. Honestly thank god for all of this because this is the worst app to exist.</p>

      <p>An awesome app you can use to communicate with friends far away! And you can add whoever you want, so it’s a good way to connect with new people! You also don’t need their number, so if you don’t want to ask your crush for their number, you don’t have to! Just look up their name and add them to make the first move! Their bitmojis could be a little better, but I think you can really show off your style!</p>

Before I updated my phone it was fine then after my phone was banned. The reason was “installing third party software”. I tried appealing this issue and it is now a month after and i have gotten no response and am still not able to use snap, all because I updated my phone.

      <p>The user experience for this app has consistently declined since the addition of Snapchat+ however Snapchat deserves a one star for something much worse. 
In the stories section they will recommend accounts with mutual friends to you. Today they recommended my rapist’s story for me to view. I’ve had her account blocked for several years now. I blocked the account again, I thought at first maybe she made a new account. But I checked my list of blocked accounts and there was only one account matching that username, with the same old nickname I had set. Meaning Snapchat really served me the story from the person who raped me… 
Accounts are blocked for a reason. And I am pretty sure this goes against the T&C of the App Store. I will find out.</p>

      <h4>all they want is our money, 1 stars (blueberrypancakesss, Apple App Store, 2024-10-04)</h4>
      <p>This is a long one. So i’ve had snapchat since you could see your friends top 3 best friends, before there were all of these extra features, before there were stories, or memories. Slowly but surely they have put more and more things that are very unlikeable into the app. I have snapchat plus (i wanted to try it out) and the only singular thing i like is being able to see when people peek into the chat.
The AI having to stay pinned to the top, I promise you i have never used that AI and i do not plan on it. A lot of us are hesitant as there have been some weird interactions and things that have happened with this AI. So to shove it down our throats and pin it on the top of the screen is ridiculous. 
As well as they still try to charge people for stupid clothing for the bitmojis when a lot of us are already paying monthly for snapchat plus is insane, i kind of just assumed if i was paying for an app that was known for being free for everybody to use, that they wouldn’t try to charge me for more. 
The bitmojis, they were super cool when they first came around! Yet somehow they found a way to make them not look like bitmojis and half of the time it looks completely different in the editing of it, and then you see it on the top of your snapchat profile and it’s actually horrendous, they look all bumpy and the hair never looks normal or even close to what it looks like in the editor. They take the good things they did have on the app that people really like and just ruin them.
I would like to add to another review i read earlier about also having very vulgar content that never used to be allowed. For some reason they’ll permanently ban your account, including all your memories, which i don’t know about yall but i have YEARS of pictures that if i lost, i would be heartbroken and have seen people experience it. You’d think that since they have memories as such an important part of the app they’d find some way to get them to you as i’ve heard of many peoples request for that being declined (and by perma ban they ban your IP so if you’re wanting a new snapchat you’re gonna need a new phone, and i’ve even seen that not work as u can’t use the same number or email or they’ll ban that IP as well) for posting a snapchat with a caption that has anything to do with marijuana even though it’s legal in half of the states, i’ve even heard of people getting banned people somebody went through and reported them, when sometimes reports are just from petty drama and stupid things like that.  They don’t even give you a chanc, you’d think 3 strikes your out or something with it being such a prominent app in almost every persons phone, yet it won’t delete an account for trying to promote sexual activity, sometimes illegal sexual activity. Which i can say i’ve reported myself and seen nothing happen. This app has gone downhill, all they care about is money in these past years and i am one more update away from deleting it.</p>

      <p>me and my significant other pay around 10euro every 3 months to get access to snapchat features which are not smt worth all that praise , i just use it for the wallpaper and the snapstreak recovery , the issue is i came upon to know that other people pay just 50cents monthly to get the same feature , and honestly that’s not fair because i’ve been using snapchat+ for a whole year now since it came out , i just wanted to try it at first but kept paying 3 months whenever it ended but atp i see it’s not worth if i’m paying more for the same features.. i do like snapchat for messaging nothing else but if it stays this way i think i’m just gon do like every one else that deleted the app after that massive data leak.

      <p>I have a lot of friends that don't like green messages, and I was thinking of switching to Samsung. This is, no joke, the only way Gen Z communicates, for the better or for the worse. It has influencer stories, a TikTok-esque doomscroll, and 80% of the photos are a corner of a girl's face. The filters kinda die down after a week of use, but some of them are still hilarious every once in a while. The group chat system is great, shows you who's talking, who's watching, etc. And, if I end up making the switch to Samsung like I said earlier, no annoying green messages. Thank you Snapchat, please don't sell your app to some random heartless company that will ruin it, love you guys.

      <p>Snapchat is good in a lot of ways. But, a couple things that would make this review a 5 star review is that there should be an option to permanently save snaps in chats. It’s super inconvenient and annoying to save every snap. Even with the 24 hour option you still have to click every snap to save it so it’s not that helpful. The other thing is that when you save a snap video in the chat it saves as a bunch of small clips instead of just the full video. It ruins the whole video. It also takes up so much space within the chat. It’s frustrating. It would be nice to just watch and save a full video without a bunch of mini clips of that one video. If these two things were changed I would use this app way more! Hopefully soon those options and changes happen soon! 🤞🏼</p>

      <h4>UGLY 3D BITMOJI UPDATE!! & SOUND ISSUE, 3 stars (KINGMECP, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>REVERT IT TO THE OLD ONE OR GIVE AN OPTION. 3D BITMOJIS ARE UGLY! THE MANAGE FRIENDSHIP OPTION SHOULD BE UNDER THE FRIENDS TAB AT THE BOTTOM, AND NOT THE CHAT TAB. THE NAVIGATION IS WEIRD

SOUND WON’T PLAY AT ALL IF PHONE IS SWITCHED TO SILENT MODE. VIDEOS WILL STILL PLAY IN OTHER APPS ON SILENT MODE, BUT NOT IN SNAPCHAT.</p>

      <h4>Halfswiping, 1 stars (kylhvgl, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>Why does this app have to ruin everything good about it. First they get rid of stickers, then they show when you are half-swiping, now they made it worse where you can see if they are half-swiping inside chat. This app needs to stop ruining things that make it great.</p>

      <h4>Abysmal, 1 stars (FabJ1966, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>They just keep adding annoying features hoping people pay for premium. Once it’s no longer the easiest way to send pics and videos users are going to abandon it just like I am. Annoying you user base intentionally is not a good marketing strategy for a premium subscription. They are playing 4D chess in a game of checkers.</p>

      <h4>Too many problems!, 3 stars (Lor🫶🏻, Apple App Store, 2024-10-03)</h4>
      <p>This is a long review but you guys have a lot to work on for this app. 
Don’t get me wrong I love Snapchat. I’ve had it for 6 years, almost 7 but while having the app I’ve been banned twice. I’ve also had Snap+ on two of the accounts. My new one and my recent account that got banned I paid $30 for a year and not even halfway through the year I got banned for no reason. What a waste of money!!! I’m on a third account now and have Snap+ again. I’ve had this new account for 3 months now and I haven’t gotten any warning that I’m aware officially. I always report people for posting inappropriate things but I get an email saying it doesn’t violate your guidelines? But whenever I post something while I’m swimming with friends I get reported for nudity and I get banned. I also post conversations between me and creeps on the app to warn others yet I get reported for bullying and harassment when I’m the one being harassed. Too many people are getting banned for the wrong reasons. Mainly girls too. Instead of adding new features like “see friends in chat” or the way our bitmoji looks you guys should fix your guidelines and your banning process. I’ve lost hundreds of photos that were in my memories. I was so upset. I lost all my friends with no way of getting them back.</p>
