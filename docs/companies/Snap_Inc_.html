      <p>Great app. Updates sometimes give way to small glitches in the app. My current issue is when I'm watching snapstories from my friends or watching tiles from other creators, a background sound will start playing as I'm watching them. Like one of those royalty-free songs you put as background music in your commerical or ad... it's definitely the app glitching but I'm not sure what's happening.</p>

      <p>I have had Snapchat for years I just recently started using the public story. I have now just found out that if someone screenshots your photo they don’t tell you who it is on the public story. As they believe it is an invasion of the other person’s privacy.  EXCUSE ME IM SORRY but that is my photo some of them have been photos of me that people have taken screenshots of. Isn’t it an invasion of my privacy to not know who it is to not be able to identify this person and ask them to not do that. The way I see it is the Snapchat creator believe it’s okay to screenshot photos of people and let that person get away with it. I will not be using the public story ever again. SNAPCHAT YOU NEED TO FIX THIS AS EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHO IS TAKING SCREENSHOTS OF THEIR PHOTOS.

Reason 2:Snapchat will let you have a friend and you can text them and give them a little pic too
Reason 3:you can have filters to have a smile on there’s and your too it has games on those filters too and show your high score and snap that and boom you got a new thing you can brag about to your friends</p>

      <p>There are so many notifications about things and people I don’t care about. I ended up turning off notifications for that reason, which makes the app completely useless. They are putting ads in the chat section that look like messages from people. The AI feature is useless, and you can’t disable it. Ridiculous app recently. I don’t see it getting better, so I deleted it for good.</p>

      <h4>Getting worse, 1 stars (moelsheik, Apple App Store, 2025-01-05)</h4>
      <p>Snapchat used to be the most-used app on my phone.
However, recently, it has become worse, and every day it gets worse than the day before.

I am facing many issues:
	•	Friend requests are not reaching me, which annoys many of my friends who think I am ignoring their requests.
	•	The Snap Map has also become very bad. When I upload videos or photos, the views are zero, and they don’t appear on the map.
	•	The support team is unresponsive; they don’t reply quickly, and when they do, they don’t address my issue. Instead, they give me advice that I already know.</p>

      <p>I keep trying to see who views my story but instead of showing me it pops up this icon that says “show story timestamps” where it would usually show the list of people who viewed my story. as if its like incentivizing that I have to get snapchat+ in order to view my own story? unless its a glitch I do not see why they would do this. and for that reason I significantly enjoy getting on this app less. I feel like a lot of my enjoyment on the app is when I see the people who view my story, and without that honestly I think I’m just gonna stop using this app altogether and just stick to instagram so… good job, I guess</p>
