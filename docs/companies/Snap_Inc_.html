      <p>this could be good for people who uses phones with poor camera but for me I don't need your filters because my camera is very good but the problem is that I am a content creator and I use this app to reach more viewers through spotlights but ever since I updated it I can't post spotlights anymore.. Are you telling content creators not to use it anymore because I am feeling very frustrated right now</p>

      <p>I love the app it's super easy to use and great to meet new people, it's easy access and it's a super efficient way to message, call or FaceTime/Video Call friends and/or family. The only thing I don't like is you can't save videos (reels, spotlights, shorts, short videos etc). If you can fix this so we can re-watch videos we see and stuff I'll change it too a 5 star rating (🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟) that's all. Kind regards Bella Ardouin</p>

      <p>TLDR: This app will give you brain cancer. Originally developed for teens to send temporary sexy images to one another, it should come as no surprise that todays' Snap "discover" page consists of nothing but OnlyFans promotion, and tabloids about girls who are paying for said OF promotion. The world would be a far better place if snap servers simply disappeared from existence.</p>

I loved sending silly funny pics to family and having a laugh (hey look, I'm a head of broccoli lol) but I got very uncomfortable when this app kept opening on its own. Literally on its own. I would be on FB, Google, YouTube, etc. just any app that wasn't Snapchat and then ✨POOF✨ it's open. I uninstalled for that reason alone. If this issue can be fixed, please lmk and I'll definitely reinstall.</p>

      <p>My daughter got a permanent band. There was no warning nor were there any explanation for the particular offense. Going through the process to try to get the account back has been less than useful. The only response is a generic automated email which provides links to webpages that site the different reasons you could get banned. Completely unhelpful.

As a parent, I certainly want to know why my child has been banned. If she has done something offensive, I want to know what it was so that I can address the situation.

The fact that my child has had her account taken away from her without warning for an unknown offense does not help address any issues. 

I attempted to reach out to Snapchat support via X but again they were 100% useless.</p>

I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve accidentally sent a snap to that AI on accident because it is stuck at the top of my conversations tab.

Also you should make it so that regular users can change the app icon I don’t think that I would pay money just to do what snap plus features have now my opinion you should make it so that snap plus members can decrease their snap score and customize more things like the app background and not just the bottom taskbar. I think you would benefit from adding more features and you should take this into consideration.</p>

      <h4>Account protection, 1 stars (elk hunter 401, Apple App Store, 2024-11-05)</h4>
      <p>My main issue with this app is that I literally had my account for six years and had so many pictures and memories on here and my account got hacked and I’ve been trying to contact support and everything else and everything that I tried to do they want my phone number or the password and all of that has been changed due to the people hacking my account there is a flaw in their system when it comes to making people get back their account and their information safely and it is so irritating because I had pictures from trips from family that I will never be able to get back and it is so frustrating that I can’t exaggerate the importance of how mad I am I wish they would set up some kind of support where I could contact somebody because they’re online support has nothing or anyway to help me at the moment and I can’t do anything about it and that’s why I’ve turned here to hopefully get a hold of somebody and maybe get my account back because all I have is my username that has not been changed. Everything else has been changed my phone number my email and all that they require to reset my password and I’m honestly wondering what legal action there is for me to take here because everything I lost.</p>

Now I have came across maybe 4 scammers on Snapchat but I will tell you that I love Snapchat a lot better then any other social media app there is, Facebook,Instagram and TikTok is nothing but filled full of scammers,I’ve actually met real friends on here and the only thing that I wish Snapchat did was before you added that person back is to send them a messege  before the add or accepting the add
Other then that I give Snapchat a 5 star rating I love everything about it</p>

      <p>gonna be a kinda long review- but i had snapchat for like 3 years after i made a new one. (my older one had too many people and not good memories, so i made a new one in 2021.) my profile was public, and i had quite a few "followers" but with the amount i had; along came the creeps. i had a private story specifically so i could expose the creeps who would message me and harass me so other women/other men would know who not to add back. yet i still got banned. i lost at least thousands of memories, as well as friends i can never get back and now i cant even make a new account on my actual phone. my entire device was banned when it shouldve been the creeps who were harassing me. im not sure if ill ever be able to make a snap account on my phone ever again! you should really update the guidelines, because i appealed the decision and still got banned! i have no way of getting those memories back or those friends back. ive seen people be able to make new accounts right after they got "banned" but me? nope. your app wont even allow it. to be quite frank i was and still am P*SSED.</p>

Despite being able to access my account on other devices, my phone remains locked out, and this has been a major inconvenience. I rely on Snapchat to stay connected and have many cherished memories stored on my account. After several emails and a single unhelpful response, I’m left wondering if anyone is actually there to help. If I’ve unknowingly done something wrong, I’d appreciate some clarity and a solution. This experience has been quite disappointing, and I hope you can finally provide the support needed to resolve this issue.</p>

      <p>Snapchat has always been my number one source of communication with friends but all of these new updates and “bug fixes” are causing problems. First of all, my memories send as snaps instead of chats. Secondly now, my chat keeps scrolling up as soon as I open it so I have to scroll all the way back down to see what someone said. It’s a little irritating and weird that these things happen after a bug fix. Sorry, I’m not usually one to write a review but it’s been an ongoing problem now and not just for me, other than that 5 stars because without Snapchat my social life would be dim.</p>

This app also never worked for me and it was horrible.

      <p>This app is amazing and a great way to chat with friends and send pictures. However, there is one thing in particular I want fixed. That is the age requirement. The app legally states you must be 13 years old or older to have access to this app. I think this app would be perfectly fine for 11 or 12 year olds. Maybe change the age limits to 12 and older? My child is 12 and really wants it but I refuse to go against the policies. Please, please, please, fix the age restrictions!!! Otherwise, a great app!</p>

      <h4>Nice app but could use some work, 3 stars (nnanaha, Apple App Store, 2024-11-02)</h4>
      <p>Snapchat is a cool app, I’ve had it for years and I’ve seen the changes that it went through, but it could definitely use more changes. I use snapchat on the daily and one thing I noticed is that certain items in the clothing section to dress up your avatar you have to pay for. I know it’s been there for a while but I didn’t care about it a whole a lot until I was writing this review and it crossed my mind. Why should we have to pay $2 or any money at all just for a jacket for your avatar? Snapchat already makes a lot of money so I feel like paying for that stuff is unnecessary. 

Now for the main reason I’m writing this review. I am a snapchat plus user and I use almost every feature accompanied by snap+. But one thing I think would make having snapchat plus more enjoyable is being able to save your previous AI backgrounds. I use this feature a lot and love creating new fun prompts but sometimes when I choose a new one, sometime later I want my old one back. But I can’t get the exact picture back and instead have to recreate it somehow to get the closest thing to it because I can’t save them. This is just a suggestion (one I highly recommend), but for snapchat plus users like me, this feature would be pretty nice.</p>

      <p>Hey everyone, if you pay for an ad they have a million reasons not to approve, they will find the reason, then they lock up the money you paid into an account that can only be used for future ads that they’ll cancel too. You don’t have a dashboard to really manage it either, you have to navigate through the search function or pay for another ad to get to it. Very scam-like and sketchy.

      <h4>HATE THE NEW SNAPCHAT INTERFACE, 3 stars (Nasbebe, Apple App Store, 2024-11-02)</h4>
      <p>I don’t like to view the stories of everybody i have subscribed to before I get to the actual person’s story I want to watch.
I don’t know all the names of the users I’ve subscribed to, so I can’t even search for their names to be able to get their stories. HONESTLY HATE THIS FEATURE. LIKE WHY ARE Y COMBINING BOTH MY FRIENDS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS STORY. IT’S SO DISORGANIZED I HATE IT‼️‼️. I LIKE THE PREVIOUS LAYOUT SO I CAN SWIPE THROUGH AND FIND THE PERSON I’VE SUBSCRIBED TO. DOESN’T IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU GUYS?? IF I HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO 1000 PEOPLE SO I HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH 800 STORIES TO GET TO THE ONE I’M LOOKING FOR?? ESPECIALLY WHEN I DON’T REMEMBER THEIR USERNAME</p>

Getting real tired of scrolling through the entire thing when I’m just trying to find turtle necks or plaid items. Not a fan of being taken back to the top each time I select a color and decide to change it. But also can you add tights to be worn under skirts/shorts?

      <h4>Discover Page needs mandatory upload dates, 1 stars (Cup of bagels, Apple App Store, 2024-11-02)</h4>
      <p>I like to get short form news content from my Discover page, but ever since Snapchat removed the upload date at the tops of videos, I will get served news without knowing when it was posted on Snapchat.

Inevitably after minutes of watch time I realize I regret my time spent on this app because I realized it was an old news story. 

Snapchat used to have the upload date, which eliminated this problem. I understand it’s good for engagement on your platform, but it is not a useful tool for news channels that get auto-serve old stories. It makes me resent my time spent on Snapchat discover page</p>

      <p>Snapchat has in the last year or two gone so downhill with constantly spamming ads for Snapchat+ on every single screen you go on to non stop it’s gotten super annoying. If you choose not to have it sync your contacts it’s gonna ask you about every second time you open the app to sync them. If I didn’t turn it on  the first 325 times I don’t want to turn it on time 326. I’ve been using Snapchat for at least 7-8 years and what used to be a fantastic platform has just turned annoying like it doesn’t want users anymore and it’s about to lose this one. I also get that Snapchat like everyone else is battling to get as much of your data as possible but at this rate you are just begging…</p>

To make matters worse I can’t even save the thousands of pictures and videos I had in my memories! MEMORIES AND VACATION PICTURES THAT I WILL NEVER SEE AGAIN WITH DECEASED FRIENDS/FAMILY!

I literally was on Snapchat last night and I’m seeing 15-year-old kids selling drugs with these Childish “menus” to buy drugs and seeing the actual women, barely close on bikinis that look like dental floss, but a trans woman post one picture of her face stating that trans. Rights are human rights and all of a sudden her account is locked. It’s so crazy that I can’t even appeal. The decision.???????? BECAUSE IM TRANS!!!!!!!!!!!

      <p>I've been using Snapchat for a while and have generally enjoyed the platform, but I'm facing a frustrating issue that’s detracting from my experience. While I appreciate the notifications when my friends post new stories, I can't actually see those stories! It feels really disconnected to be alerted about updates from my friends but not be able to engage with their content. 
I've tried troubleshooting by refreshing my app, checking my settings, and even reinstalling it, but nothing seems to work. It’s disappointing, especially since part of the fun of Snapchat is seeing what my friends are up to in real-time. 
I hope this issue can be addressed in future updates, as it’s a major part of what makes Snapchat enjoyable. Until then, I can only give it a couple of stars for the notifications, which feel like a tease without the ability to view the stories. Here's hoping for a fix soon!
Thank you

I think people without premium should be allowed to delete the AI feature because the amount of times I’ve accidentally sent a snap to the AI and not the person I’m texting is absolutely annoying, and that’s because the AI is always at the top of my friends list….

I will change my review once this is resolved- but for no reason should I try to open Snapchat or try to open it through a notification should it ever take more than five seconds. For it to take 5 minutes is actually insane.
On top of that, we lost the ability to block Snapchat from sending snaps and chats every other week. I don’t care what national day it is. I don’t care what holiday it is. I don’t care about any of it. I find it incredible annoying that I have to clear out my chat because I don’t want it in my chat list. Not everyone wants an AI chat either. It gets super annoying when all these extra unnecessary Snapchat features are taking up all the chat list.</p>

      <h4>Missing Cameos After Update 10/30/24, 1 stars (Stilettofem, Apple App Store, 2024-10-30)</h4>
      <p>Two technical glitches… I have a  reoccurring issue when sending snaps in chat — that the snap videos spool / “sending” takes forever to go through  and if I don’t hang around with the app open while each snap of a set is sending, then the snaps either don’t go through at all or only a few ten second clips go through and the rest are missing. So, hoping to avoid or fix this issue. I updated my app today and now the cameos/avatar, but not your Bitmoji specifically the cameos are completely missing from the chat toolbar and the only way I can even see that they exist is to create a snap and add a cameo as a sticker, but I can no longer prompt in chat with a word or phrase and click the side icon it will only give me graphics or Bitmoji a NO CAMEOS and the cameo tab is missing completely. Was this on purpose? Please put it back. Also, it would be incredibly helpful to be able to finish a snap and click out to another app and not worry that what I just sent will disappear and not go through.</p>

If I’m talking to her about a serious topic she just take that as a funny joke 5.

      <p>Well, well, well. Do I have something to say. 
     Snapchat used to be my favorite. It used to be the one thing I looked forward to at the end of a long and difficult day on the job. There was nothing that brought me more of a thrill than updating my devoted fans on my private story about said days adventures… that was until today. The day that ruined it all. The day I opened snapchat and was SHOCKED TO MY CORE to see my favorite snapchat font MISSING from the font options. The gorgeous big black letters that just popped out from the florescent yellow background. That was all I ever needed in life. Snapchat, the AUDICITY you had to remove such an iconic and truly pivotal and quintessential font to so many is just so disheartening. I am willing to change my mind, Snapchat, if you are willing to bring back the one thing we snapchat users crave most. The yellow font.</p>

We’ve looked into all of the available information, and unfortunately we’re unable to provide any further assistance.    We won’t be corresponding any further to this conversation, and apologize for any disappointment this may cause.” Like good to know that any sensitive information I have on my account is probably in the hands of someone else such as my passwords family photos ext…</p>

      <h4>not sure what the draw is anymore., 1 stars (initialMark, Apple App Store, 2024-10-29)</h4>
      <p>Snapchat at this point is an amalgamation of a bunch of different social media platforms. and it doesn’t even do it well.

my biggest issue, is the consistent bugs with the chat feature; the whole thing snapchat got popular for. when i scroll in a chat with anyone i talk to frequently; just to check a message, it will scroll months and months behind. i will try to reopen the chat, reload the app, and this issue still happens. it prevents me from being able to see new messages. 

another issue i’ve consistently faced, is my videos being deleted when i stop recording. this is problematic when i like to talk with my friends through videos. and you know what? this never used to happen. neither of these issues were problems 3 years ago. 

i am aggravated that snapchat cares more about keeping your attention on their app as long as possible, than keeping the features they are known for bug-free. i’m glad i barely use this app anymore, the only feature i have ever used has degraded beyond functionality.</p>
