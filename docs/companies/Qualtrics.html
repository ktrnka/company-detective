<h2>Acquisitions and Partnerships</h2>

        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Negative Sentiment Towards Qualtrics</h2>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have been encountering errors with Qualtrics everyday for the past month. All of these errors happen on Google Chrome. I am either getting '400 Error' or 'Error' after trying to proceed after the consent form." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/anxlsj/errors_with_qualtrics_may_be_chrome_related/">(Franklin551, Reddit, 2019-02-07)</a></li>
<li>"I had this issue and also another one where Qualtrics surveys did not render the 'secret code' at the end. The problems seemed to only occur in Chrome browser and clearing/resetting cookies and cache was only a short lived temporary fix." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/anxlsj/errors_with_qualtrics_may_be_chrome_related/efwrllb/">(evldva, Reddit, 2019-02-07)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics surveys have constantly been redirecting me after completion to another survey. I've just been skipping them when I see Qualtrics." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/e469mp/qualtrics_micro_survey_scams/f9ea0is/">(bearjew96, Reddit, 2019-12-01)</a></li>
<li>"We currently have Qualtrics but have been very unhappy with the stability and reliability of the platform. From random outages to things not working how they should, and then a lack of customer service, we’re pretty unhappy with them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqofj9/">(Ballsackblazer4, Reddit, 2021-08-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Service Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The biggest issues most people have with Qualtrics are the customer support and the per respondent costs. Pricing is not the most transparent and it can end up a lot more expensive than you bargained for." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnj4yzt/">(analyticated, Reddit, 2024-09-17)</a></li>
<li>"Have been very disappointed with their customer service especially. Also quality of their 'XM scientists' is low." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqpw9r/">(Zencarrot, Reddit, 2021-08-28)</a></li>
<li>"They use garbage panels with terrible QA and their customer service is abysmal." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnkfrk2/">(jemedebrouille, Reddit, 2024-09-17)</a></li>
<li>"I hate Qualtrics. In fact when I started my current role I made it my mission to get rid of it from the business." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lpdctov/">(71509, Reddit, 2024-09-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics is crazy expensive by comparison to SurveyMonkey, so that might be a lot of the reasoning." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm4ltmz/">(Halostar, Reddit, 2021-02-05)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/">(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics is $$$ and is likely going to become even more so in the future." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqn6tm/">(Zencarrot, Reddit, 2021-08-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall Product Quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The quality of Qualtrics survey product has been greatly diminished while their costs and customer service have both become worse." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lp39eev/">(jelybely8, Reddit, 2024-09-26)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics is terrible: overpriced, simplistic, and largely abandoned the original mission to offer a quality research platform." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hari760/">(Simmy566, Reddit, 2021-08-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Positive Sentiment Towards Qualtrics</h2>
<h3>Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I am a pretty heavy user of Qualtrics and it instantly surprises me with the wealth of features. The logic you can build into surveys is absolutely insane with all of the branching and the embedded data you can carry through and change." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm4d7wk/">(five_year_plan, Reddit, 2021-02-05)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics can handle complicated routing and other instructions better than SM. It is easy to setup personalized survey links. Setting up translations is easy." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnjwfu1/">(beachtechie04, Reddit, 2024-09-17)</a></li>
<li>"The survey design functionality itself is superior to what you would find with most vendors." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqn6tm/">(Zencarrot, Reddit, 2021-08-28)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics is still king, you have full control but also can have a quick easy UI." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqj466/">(aeywaka, Reddit, 2021-08-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Customer Support</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The customer service is very good. If you call you’ll get help. In eight years and who knows how many calls I’ve yet to not get an answer to a question." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hass6s3/">(armyprof, Reddit, 2021-08-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison with Competitors</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Survey routing logic is way more time consuming in SurveyMonkey (and sometimes does not match what Qualtrics can do period). SurveyMonkey forces me to compromise the design of my surveys because I’m not able to pipe from certain question types or route in the way I want." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm5qwbt/">(mmmarcin, Reddit, 2021-02-05)</a></li>
