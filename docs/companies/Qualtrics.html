        <h1>About Qualtrics</h1>
<p>Qualtrics is a prominent player in the experience management (XM) software industry, providing a comprehensive platform for managing customer, employee, product, and brand experiences. The company was founded on January 1, 2002, and is headquartered in Provo, Utah <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>. Qualtrics was acquired by SAP in 2019 for $8 billion but was later sold in March 2023 to Silver Lake and CPP Investments for $12.5 billion, allowing it to operate independently <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/">(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)</a>.</p>

<p>Qualtrics has been recognized as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Voice of the Customer (VoC) Platforms, highlighting its strong market position <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/">(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>

<h2>Executive Changes</h2>

<h2>Pricing and Licensing Concerns</h2>
<p>Qualtrics has faced challenges regarding pricing, with a report from Duke University noting a 50% increase in licensing costs compared to the previous year. This has led Duke to explore alternative solutions and negotiate with Qualtrics to manage costs effectively <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/news/important-news-about-qualtrics/">(Important News About Qualtrics, Office of Information Technology, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Qualtrics continues to be a leader in the experience management space, driven by innovative product offerings and strategic partnerships. However, it faces challenges related to pricing and competition in a rapidly evolving market. The company's focus on AI-driven solutions and partnerships in critical sectors like healthcare may provide significant growth potential in the coming years.</p>

        <h2>Issues and Complaints</h2>
<h3>Technical Errors</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I have been encountering errors with Qualtrics everyday for the past month. All of these errors happen on Google Chrome. I am either getting '400 Error' or 'Error' after trying to proceed after the consent form." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/anxlsj/errors_with_qualtrics_may_be_chrome_related/">(Franklin551, Reddit, 2019-02-07)</a></li>
<li>"I had this issue and also another one where Qualtrics surveys did not render the 'secret code' at the end. The problems seemed to only occur in Chrome browser and clearing/resetting cookies and cache was only a short lived temporary fix." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/anxlsj/errors_with_qualtrics_may_be_chrome_related/efwrllb/">(evldva, Reddit, 2019-02-07)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics surveys have constantly been redirecting me after completion to another survey." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/e469mp/qualtrics_micro_survey_scams/f9ea0is/">(bearjew96, Reddit, 2019-12-01)</a></li>
<li>"Some surveys on Qualtrics work just fine and pay off as advertised, but often you'll get a flurry of surveys made by people who don't know what they're doing." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/e469mp/qualtrics_micro_survey_scams/f9e5yyz/">(Spillchucker, Reddit, 2019-12-01)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Pricing and Licensing</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses. I've tested a few alternatives, and so far, GuidedTrack is the best one because it's cheaper (they even have a free tier) and as powerful as Qualtrics." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/">(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)</a></li>
<li>"Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/">(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)</a></li>
<li>"The pricing complaints are real—it’s not transparent, and you end up paying way more than expected. Plus, customer service issues? Definitely frustrating when you’re dealing with tight deadlines and complex surveys." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lr8iqkj/">(Odd-Courage-, Reddit, 2024-10-10)</a></li>

<h3>Customer Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The whole vibe I get from them... is that they couldn't care less about the experience of their own customers." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lx4df7p/">(shkilo, Reddit, 2024-11-14)</a></li>
<li>"I hate Qualtrics. In fact when I started my current role I made it my mission to get rid of it from the business." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lpdctov/">(71509, Reddit, 2024-09-28)</a></li>

<h2>Product Features and Comparisons</h2>
<h3>Functionality and Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics is superior to RedCAP in most use cases. As someone who just moved from Qualtrics to RedCAP, I really can't see why it would be preferred. Qualtrics does everything RedCAP does and more." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl2qiza/">(None, Reddit, 2021-11-18)</a></li>

<li>"Qualtrics can handle complicated routing and other instructions better than SM. It is easy to setup personalized survey links." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnjwfu1/">(beachtechie04, Reddit, 2024-09-17)</a></li>
<li>"In my experience, Qualtrics has about all the functionality I would want from a survey application." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl3p8ne/">(Flemon45, Reddit, 2021-11-18)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<ul>
<li>"There is a learning curve to Qualtrics, but that’s probably unavoidable with something that has as much functionality as it does." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl3p8ne/">(Flemon45, Reddit, 2021-11-18)</a></li>

<h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This is not an ethical poll.. are there rules against this kind of loaded and persuasive language?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/log7gf6/">(FreeAtLast-, Reddit, 2024-09-23)</a></li>

<li>"This is not a survey, it's a marketing email targeted at people who are highly impressionable." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/loh3ufa/">(irondeepbicycle, Reddit, 2024-09-23)</a></li>

<h2>General Overview</h2>
<h3>Company Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics is an online survey tool where users can build and distribute surveys, collect responses, and even analyze response data, all from within the same platform." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/loja5u7/">(UT_Dave, Reddit, 2024-09-23)</a></li>
