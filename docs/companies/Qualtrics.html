<h3>Pricing and Licensing Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license.

<h3>Customer Support and Service Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The biggest issues most people have with Qualtrics are the customer support and the per respondent costs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnj4yzt/">(analyticated, Reddit, 2024-09-17)</a></li>
