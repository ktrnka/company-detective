<p>Qualtrics is a prominent cloud-native software platform specializing in experience management (XM), which helps organizations manage and enhance customer, employee, product, and brand experiences. The company was founded in 2002 by Ryan and Jared Smith and has grown significantly over the years. As of 2023, Qualtrics serves nearly 20,000 clients across more than 100 countries and reported approximately $1.5 billion in total revenue for 2022, marking a 36% increase year-over-year <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-cost-savings-and-added-revenue-pay-off-initial-qualtrics-investment-in-1-5-years-302068577.html">(Qualtrics, PR Newswire, 2024-02-22)</a>.

</ul>
<h3>Business Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license.

<h2>Positive Sentiment Towards Qualtrics</h2>
<h3>User Experience and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Qualtrics is superior to RedCAP in most use cases. As someone who just moved from Qualtrics to RedCAP, I really can't see why it would be preferred.

<li>"As a web developer though, going through 600 lines in a spreadsheet to spot check 'sketchy' answers makes no sense. A good software should point out items answered too quickly or always with the first option, etc." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hmc63mm/">(Sighann, Reddit, 2021-11-28)</a></li>
