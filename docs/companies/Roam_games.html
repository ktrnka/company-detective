        <h2>Sentiment: Positive Experiences with Roam and Games</h2>
<h3>Immersion and Atmosphere</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Sitting down on the bench under that tree... just reading the in-game books while listening to the wind blowing on the grass, birds chirping... Only KCD and RDR2 have hit this sort of immersion for me, they're unparalleled." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gseog0f/">(None, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I love free roam games. Any game that allows you to ignore missions and just explore, while providing a huge and beautiful open world." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbzdqi/">(DMarlow310, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I enjoy Assassins Creed:Odyssey for running around and exploring. It looks very pretty. But you'll never find anything as immersive as RDR2 sadly... it's set a new standard for open world gaming." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6sdel7/">(Bald_And_Bankrupt, Reddit, 2021-07-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Enjoyment of Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Just Cause 4 is pretty great fun for running around doing random things/some random encounters. Plus it’s on gamepass! Always a win." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdo7zo/">(TordenLive, Reddit, 2023-08-09)</a></li>
<li>"The Lego open world games could be quite fun! I enjoy them!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdmqki/">(RowSnow, Reddit, 2023-08-09)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Negative Experiences with Roam and Games</h2>
<h3>Frustrations with Game Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I feel the movement is sluggish, hunting is difficult and everything else feels ‘heavy’. The movement, the horse…you can't go whizzing around the map like other open world games, it just feels….bog down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6y1g9j/">(4juice, Reddit, 2021-07-29)</a></li>
<li>"Red Dead Redemption 2 could be enjoyable. Very similar structure to GTA, but depending on your brothers habits/preferences, he could find the slowness or mechanics annoying and overwhelming." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvbgj97/">(jvbrczp, Reddit, 2023-08-08)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Desire for Improved Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Having better, ready access to fast travel should've been available." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbpdda/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I think I would have walked around a lot more if walking pace was at least a little bit practical." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbo3ry/">(None, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Mixed Experiences with Roam and Games</h2>
<h3>Exploration vs. Pacing</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The reason why the atmosphere and setting of this game stands out so much is because they force the player to take the game slower than they would in a game like GTA." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsb7qjk/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"When I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I <em>knew</em> that I would fall in love with this game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/">(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: General Observations on Games</h2>
<h3>Comparisons to Other Games</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, RDR2 has ruined most other free roaming games, just with the graphics alone." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsapeqv/">(shivermetimbers68, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I'm a huge AC fan but after completing rd for a second time I literally haven't been able to get engrossed into any other open world game. It's actually ruined most of the other games I've ever played." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsgumo2/">(DavidB2000, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Features and Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It's a shame that you need to be constantly connected (it's a 'mmo' (no real mmo feature, you just see other players)) but I had a blast on it. Lot of puzzles, lot of exploration." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/l30tvea/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>
<li>"The game seems great, but there is no puzzle (or very little) AFAIK. It's closer to Rust fused with Factorio: Open world Sandbox." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvisy7/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)</a></li>
