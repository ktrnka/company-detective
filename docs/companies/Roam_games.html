<h3>Immersive Open World</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, RDR2 has ruined most other free roaming games, just with the graphics alone." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsapeqv/">(shivermetimbers68, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I'm a huge AC fan but after completing rd for a second time I literally haven't been able to get engrossed into any other open world game. It's actually ruined most of the other games I've ever played." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsgumo2/">(DavidB2000, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"Sitting down on the bench under that tree on the road between Rattay and Ledetchko and just reading the in-game books while listening to the wind blowing on the grass, birds chirping, and the occasional traveler passing by." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gseog0f/">(None, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I love free roam games. Any game that allows you to ignore missions and just explore, while providing a huge and beautiful open world." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbzdqi/">(DMarlow310, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"The open world is fun to explore, and the humor is great." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f8p6hhf/">(randomwatts, Reddit, 2019-11-25)</a></li>
<li>"The humour is the cherry on top of an awesome open world game with lots of pop references." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84mb4m/">(mahamrap, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Enjoyable Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The ability to decide how interactions unfold is amazing. Antagonize, threaten, calm." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6szqx2/">(Mrvonblogger, Reddit, 2021-07-28)</a></li>
<li>"I enjoy the characters and setting." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/">(Monsieurabsurd, Reddit, 2021-07-28)</a></li>
<li>"I think my favorites are Hobbit and Dimensions. Hobbit cause its like running around a medieval lego world, and Dimensions because of the variety of cities." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f85fpvj/">(Metron_Seijin, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Constructive Criticism</h2>
<h3>Gameplay Pacing and Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>"That's a tall order because part of the atmosphere in RDR2 is the deliberately slow pace the game sets, which was something that every reviewer felt was a negative as it dragged gameplay to a crawl when looting or interacting with things." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsb7qjk/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"When I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I <em>knew</em> that I would fall in love with this game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/">(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"The downside is that you run out of things to do after like, chapter 3, so the ending comes faster." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"Having better, ready access to fast travel should've been available." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbpdda/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I feel the movement is sluggish, hunting is difficult and everything else feels â€˜heavyâ€™. The movement, the horseâ€¦you can't go whizzing around the map like other open world games, it just feelsâ€¦.bog down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6zgrph/">(KoYouTokuIngoa, Reddit, 2021-07-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Features and Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It's a shame that you need to be constantly connected (it's a 'mmo' (no real mmo feature, you just see other players)) but I had a blast on it. Lot of puzzles, lot of exploration." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/l30tvea/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>
<li>"The game seems great, but there is no puzzle (or very little) AFAIK. It's closer to Rust fused with Factorio: Open world Sandbox." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvisy7/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)</a></li>
<li>"I have completed only the main storyline in Lego Batman 3 and it is barely a free roam game, especially compared to Lego Batman 2." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f83wxh8/">(frdhog, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Insights on Roaming in Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Complexity of Roaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Playing roam is easy. Playing roam correctly is not." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuc3ez/">(lraeyx, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"This is correct. Roam is the hardest role to play correctly. Most under appreciated role, and the most necessary." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnztslu/">(PoastRotatoes, Reddit, 2024-09-20)</a></li>
<li>"A good roam makes jungling easier. A good jungle makes winning the game easier." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/">(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Yes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/">(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Great roamer dictate the flow of the game, but one single mistake from jungler can cost the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnum46u/">(Fanserker, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Roaming requires you just to know basic fundamental knowledge and implement it. You need more macro knowledge." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnufi7q/">(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/">(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Roaming Strategies and Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I think your first mistake is assuming all your midlaners should roam to skirmishes, without question. Roaming is matchup reliant." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1z8g7/">(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I will roam to both side crabs as support to help out but then my ADC cry's like a baby because he doesn't know how to play defensively." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1h3hb/">(MrCrow9000, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I find the opposite quite common lol. I'm Ziggs mid, the enemy Ahri roams without even pushing the wave, I spam-ping the toplaner multiple times, she even walks on a ward, but nothing, he dies anyway." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/">(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Some champs in mid aren't that good at roaming. Like Orianna or Kayle are pretty vulnerable early." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr12ii9/">(RefanRes, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I typically try to secure the scuttlers (side crab real name) as mid, BUT as play with Ori most of the time i prefer not to roam until late game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr2jelm/">(for3ignx, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Mids should always roam, help out jungler, help out in other lanes as best a possible. Often the mid lane player can make or break the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr4tkse/">(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
