        <h2>Sentiment: Positive Experiences with Games</h2>
<h3>Immersive Open World</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Honestly, RDR2 has ruined most other free roaming games, just with the graphics alone." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsapeqv/">(shivermetimbers68, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I'm a huge AC fan but after completing rd for a second time I literally haven't been able to get engrossed into any other open world game. It's actually ruined most of the other games I've ever played." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsgumo2/">(DavidB2000, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"Sitting down on the bench under that tree on the road between Rattay and Ledetchko and just reading the in-game books while listening to the wind blowing on the grass, birds chirping, and the occasional traveler passing by." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gseog0f/">(None, Reddit, 2021-03-27)</a></li>
<li>"I love free roam games. Any game that allows you to ignore missions and just explore, while providing a huge and beautiful open world." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbzdqi/">(DMarlow310, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"The open world is fun to explore, and the humor is great." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f8p6hhf/">(randomwatts, Reddit, 2019-11-25)</a></li>
<li>"The humour is the cherry on top of an awesome open world game with lots of pop references." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84mb4m/">(mahamrap, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>
<li>"I really like its atmosphere because I’m a fan of dinosaur." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f850ozv/">(DevaPain7, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Enjoyable Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The ability to decide how interactions unfold is amazing. Antagonize, threaten, calm." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6szqx2/">(Mrvonblogger, Reddit, 2021-07-28)</a></li>
<li>"I enjoy the characters and setting." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/">(Monsieurabsurd, Reddit, 2021-07-28)</a></li>
<li>"I think my favorites are Hobbit and Dimensions. Hobbit cause its like running around a medieval lego world, and Dimensions because of the variety of cities." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f85fpvj/">(Metron_Seijin, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Sentiment: Constructive Criticism</h2>
<h3>Gameplay Pacing and Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>"That's a tall order because part of the atmosphere in RDR2 is the deliberately slow pace the game sets, which was something that every reviewer felt was a negative as it dragged gameplay to a crawl when looting or interacting with things." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsb7qjk/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"When I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I <em>knew</em> that I would fall in love with this game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/">(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"The downside is that you run out of things to do after like, chapter 3, so the ending comes faster." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"Having better, ready access to fast travel should've been available." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbpdda/">(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)</a></li>
<li>"I feel the movement is sluggish, hunting is difficult and everything else feels ‘heavy’. The movement, the horse…you can't go whizzing around the map like other open world games, it just feels….bog down." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6zgrph/">(KoYouTokuIngoa, Reddit, 2021-07-29)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Features and Expectations</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It's a shame that you need to be constantly connected (it's a 'mmo' (no real mmo feature, you just see other players)) but I had a blast on it. Lot of puzzles, lot of exploration." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/l30tvea/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>
<li>"The game seems great, but there is no puzzle (or very little) AFAIK. It's closer to Rust fused with Factorio: Open world Sandbox." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvisy7/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)</a></li>
<li>"I have completed only the main storyline in Lego Batman 3 and it is barely a free roam game, especially compared to Lego Batman 2." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f83wxh8/">(frdhog, Reddit, 2019-11-20)</a></li>

<h2>Sentiment: Insights on Roaming in Gameplay</h2>
<h3>Complexity of Roaming</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Playing roam is easy. Playing roam correctly is not." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuc3ez/">(lraeyx, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"This is correct. Roam is the hardest role to play correctly. Most under appreciated role, and the most necessary." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnztslu/">(PoastRotatoes, Reddit, 2024-09-20)</a></li>
<li>"A good roam makes jungling easier. A good jungle makes winning the game easier." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/">(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Yes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/">(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Great roamer dictate the flow of the game, but one single mistake from jungler can cost the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnum46u/">(Fanserker, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Roaming requires you just to know basic fundamental knowledge and implement it. You need more macro knowledge." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnufi7q/">(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/">(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Roaming Strategies and Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I think your first mistake is assuming all your midlaners should roam to skirmishes, without question. Roaming is matchup reliant." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1z8g7/">(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I will roam to both side crabs as support to help out but then my ADC cry's like a baby because he doesn't know how to play defensively." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1h3hb/">(MrCrow9000, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I find the opposite quite common lol. I'm Ziggs mid, the enemy Ahri roams without even pushing the wave, I spam-ping the toplaner multiple times, she even walks on a ward, but nothing, he dies anyway." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/">(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Some champs in mid aren't that good at roaming. Like Orianna or Kayle are pretty vulnerable early." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr12ii9/">(RefanRes, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I typically try to secure the scuttlers (side crab real name) as mid, BUT as play with Ori most of the time i prefer not to roam until late game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr2jelm/">(for3ignx, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Mids should always roam, help out jungler, help out in other lanes as best a possible. Often the mid lane player can make or break the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr4tkse/">(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
