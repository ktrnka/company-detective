      <p>The only scavenger hunt I did was riddled with continuity errors, making us choose weird paths and ultimately making it a pretty ordinary experience. To add to that, the app makes it so incredibly difficult (perhaps impossible) to cancel the subscription and they do not even remind you that you have an active subscription to a service that you aren't using. This is deeply annoying and disappointing</p>

      <p>App needs work. Once you start a hunt it is hard to navigate of you change apps. 8 also signed up for the free trial, emailed their support to cancel it, chatted twice and have called them and I still have been charged.</p>

      <p>Got this app while I was on vacation for a week and canceled before the free trial was up. Was told I wouldnt be charged and that my subscription was canceled. I still got charged and called about a refund and was told I would receive it in 3-4 business days. It has been almost 2 weeks and I still have not received my refund. This app is really not that great and half the time it never worked or was wrong about locations. Would not recommend this app.</p>

      <p>Tried my first hunt in Walnut Creek, CA, and it was beyond disappointing. Went to the first location (Fountain Head) and couldn't find it. I looked all over. Then I talked to a local, and she said that it had been moved about 2 years ago to a location over a mile away. I went there, and it had been removed for restoration. By this time, I had been looking for this thing for over an hour! Uggghhh! And now I was a mile away from the second location. I was so frustrated that I just gave up.</p>

      <p>Awful app, map had me 2 miles away from every challenge, Rip off hunts. Do not use. Honestly would have been better just wandering about looking at historical things ourselves. £10 a ticket each and at each of the 6 locations 2 rubbish questions and 2 tasks to take pictures. Took us about 20 mins to do whole thing. Had potential but clearly just a scam. No real challenges or tasks to perform. Waste of time. Avoid! Would score zero stars.</p>

      <p>This review is based off the sign in experience and the hunt for Franklin, TN. First, the "magic link" sent via email repeatedly wouldn't work. It kept trying to load the Play Store rather than the app itself, even though it was installed. Sign in by text also wouldn't work. It repeatedly triggered a magic link email that would, of course, not work. I ultimately signed in via Google. As for the Franklin hunt, it lacked much depth. There were no puzzles or real challenges.</p>

      <p>Don't waste your money. This implies that you'll have a map to follow around and find the items (likeost scavenger hunts). No. You only get a map of you pay. And you have to pay for each item you can't find. The app requests permissions that it has absolutely no need for, and it's camera quality is garbage. I paid extra for the date night add on, and it didn't show up on my account, even after calling customer service. I'm just glad I got it on discount and only lost $40 instead of $90.</p>

      <p>This app is dangerous and poorly built. On dangerous: it asks you to take photos and other things while on a scavenger hunt. These along with your location is available to all other teams on the hunt. Worse, once you are done your location remains available to other teams. This is not ok Poorly built: the app routinely glitched, froze and did not update progress. Even signing up glitched. Any company organizing a scavenger hunt through this app is not offering you a good experience or product</p>

      <p>Doesn't work with our phones. Had to carry a tablet in order to do the hunts. The time they say it will take does not take into account other foot traffic. We walked with our small dog and the search for locations was more complicated than we would want. This may be good for large groups, but was not fun for 2 persons on vacation. As retirees, we found that the challenges were foolish and not something that we would want to do.</p>

      <p>A real pain to manage your account - cancelling your membership and stopping payments is a process unto itself; they will continue to charge you unless you email them then fill out a webform. The challenges themselves were neither challenging nor particularly fun. The photos we took through the app never got sent to us and after the hunt ends, we couldn't find any way to access them. Getting into teams is also time consuming as is using a voucher. Overall quite a poor experience.</p>

      <p>Awful experience with the app. You pay money to go on a completely unvetted tour. Sites we experienced were incorrectly placed or putright closed due to construction. Grouping is counterproductive. Cooperation only gets one player credit while others get nothing or are marked absent. One player answering a question will go to the next page without consent and other players get nothing. GPS feature kept marking us as out-of-range while being in arm's reach.

      <h4>Will Time Out If You Need A Break, 1 stars (4forliz, Apple App Store, 2024-09-23)</h4>
      <p>Downloaded the app and paid for the French Quarter Hunt in New Orleans.  Since it was 90+ F we opted to take a break and have lunch and cool off (we have done other hunts in other countries/cities and it was never an issue).  When we went back out the app had timed us out out of the scavenger hunt!   We basically missed out on half of the scavenger hunt.  Money is not the issue as it is not a very expensive purchase but this is a crappy practice for a company that supposedly offers a sightseeing alternative.</p>

      <p>This app is a waste of time and money. My family and I were on a vacation and for a fun way to end it we decided to do a scavenger hunt with this app. It was horribly confusing to share with your family then we went to one location and it was closed and the workers had no clue about any scavenger hunt. Next stop was like a mile away and the map does not move with you it just shows you where the location is and doesn’t move at all. Next stop was ok and was pretty close to the other one but then the next one was like another mile away. Eventually we gave up and had to walk all the way back to our car which we had no idea where it was. So yeah save your money and time and don’t get this game don’t make the same mistake we did! Also it drains your battery completely mine was at like 93 when we started and when we ended it it was at 20%</p>

      <p>Signing up was broken.  Couldn’t sign up with the Apple login. My friend’s Apple login seemed to associate her with someone across the country?!  Signing up by email worked for me, but not my friend.  Had to resort to using text.  Had to kill the app to do it as it refused to do anything other than email after trying email. 🤦🏻‍♂️  Adding people to group was just as bad, mostly due to all the login issues.

Most of the challenges were fun.  There were several fill in the blank style challenges that appeared under the “pill” on the iPhone… so some work needs to be done to make sure things render correctly.  Submitting was painful and hung up several times on the scoring step, leaving us to retake pictures since I couldn’t use the one we just just took.  The hunt was out of date as a couple of the features have changed.  And one of the challenges was a bit odd… it asked for an updated cover picture for Tiber Park, but Tiber Park wasn’t the destination and was not nearby.  

I like the ideas and think doing this in other cities could be fun, but the app experience really killed much of the fun.</p>

      <p>We are currently tracking full-time in an RV and paying for some type of tour in every city gets expensive. 
I thought this would be a great way for our family of 5 to see the areas we’re stopping in. 
The first time we tried to use it, the app didn’t work at all. I was told technical support would help and get back to me. I didn’t hear anything back. 
The next time we tried to use it, it worked better, but it is glitchy. If you let your screen go dark or switch to a different app, this app screen goes black and you have to close it out and go back in. 
Also, in the beginning, they have you choose a name and role for everyone. I expected that the app would assign certain tasks to each role. Yes, I want to work together with my family, but I don’t want the kids fighting over who gets to take the picture, you know? 
Anyway, I’ll keep it for the year we paid for, but I wouldn’t buy again.</p>

      <h4>Poor route planning!, 1 stars (Rperlow ., Apple App Store, 2023-03-13)</h4>
      <p>The starting point is poorly labeled. The house is an Air B&B and the tenants were very annoyed by us even pulling into the driveway to check in. Yelled at us to leave! We parked at a Parking Garage which looked convenient but turned out to be nowhere near the next stop. Meanwhile we passed another stop on the way to the stop we were on our way too (a library). Very poorly designed route. You should suggest appropriate parking and places to eat. Finally, the game ended without warning. Why can’t we finish the challenges?!!! Really sucked. Want our money back.</p>

      <p>A month after our first (Lake Eola) hunt that we completed and got the message that we had been awarded points - it still doesn’t show up (nor the points).  We’ve contacted support in every single way that we can find and always get the same tired message: it’s an issue they’re aware of and they are working on it.  They’ll keep us posted.

But it’s never fixed, they’re ever in touch or keeping us posted.

Sorry to have bought a season pass to this.  Will try to get a refund and try another similar app.  Friends did the other app and got their points and moved on to do more hunts.  While we sit here waiting for our first one to show up.  🙄</p>

      <p>In the 15 years that I have used apple apps I have never left a review of any app.  I am compelled to leave this one as my first and only review.  I hate this app with every fiber of my being.  The whole process of buying tickets and the trying to enter them into the app left much to desire.   Every time you switch to another app, it restarts.  You enter the code to start the hunt, then have no way to actually start the hunt.  When you try to join a game, it says you’ve already used the code.  There are no instructions of how to play.  It just shows you a picture and you have to figure out that you have to find where it is, and stand near where the photo was taken.  But not every question.   Video uploads take 3-5 minutes of standing around, doing nothing. Nobody can do anything until it finishes.  The upload crashed several times and had to be redone.  There were questions like finding which star wasn’t represented on the sidewalk. There are hundreds of stars, all over the area.   It’s just gets worse from there.     Ugh!!!!!!</p>

      <p>This app at first glace seems to be a pretty neat app, it sounds fun until you actually start to play it. Trying to log in and join a game is hard enough, it took ages just to log in. But then when you actually try to play the game, the GPS is so horribly planned, that if you’re standing directly in front of the building, the app will still tell you you’re 200 feet away, and you can’t even send them proof to tell them you’re there, you just have to complain, but got knows if they even dare to check them.

      <p>Puzzles are very generic, like take a photo of some trash, or a sign that starts with an A. Most puzzles either don’t work at all or will accept any photo, which means it’s not any fun. It tries to get you to stand 0 ft from a spot but in a city gps is not that accurate so even when on the right spot it tells you that you are in the wrong place. Signup process didn’t work so we had to spend time on the phone to support. The support person was helpful and resolved the issue.</p>

      <p>I am not sure I have ever left an app review, but I had to for this one. My husband got this for my birthday. While at dinner we all opened the app and tried to join. There is so much other junk on the app not related to the event that it is difficult to figure out where to go for what you need. Not user friendly at all. We finally join but then all of us had issues. My app crashed every time I clicked the event button. Another friend couldn’t join at all. My husband finally got the first bar so we walked over and got a drink. We decided to just do the challenges he was seeing since no one else could join, but the camera feature was horrible. It was grainy and super zoomed in when taking a selfie.  It rejected every picture we tried to take as “not what they are looking for”. We finally called the help line. Spent 20 minutes of our time on the call with zero resolution except that she emailed my husband the list of bars and we completed the tour with no challenges (Which was kind of the point. We could have bar hopped on our own.) 
As for the bars, ours were all really close to each other, which was nice. One of them was shut down. They were all kind of the same style of bar, small, pub style. It would have been nice to have some variety. We walked right past a couple of bars that was super eclectic and fun and would have been neat to have on the list. 
As a whole, a complete waste of money though. Fun idea, very poorly executed.</p>

      <h4>Great idea poor execution, 2 stars (Narasenbei, Apple App Store, 2022-05-28)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded the app for a scavenger hunt in Detroit. We had 6 people in the team and everyone had loading issues, couldn’t upload photos or videos, and sometimes the app would just crash. 
The layout of the hunt was poorly done and felt like someone making it didn’t actually play it through, what was supposed to be 1 hour and 3 miles was 6 miles and 2 hours before we gave up. There was no guidance on where to go next and the locations were grouped in such a way that it didn’t make an actual circle. Just plot points on a map. If there was at least a numbering system or a recommended path that would helped significantly. 
The most frustrating part was every time we opened the map it went to Nigeria and we had to scroll and zoom until we got to Detroit. You couldn’t just pop up the map to find the next location without zooming and scrolling every time. 
Lastly there were some things that just no longer existed. The hunt was for murals but in Detroit they can be painted over at any time especially if someone buys the building, so we had to give up on a couple because they just didn’t exist, making us have to no complete the game. 
Overall I would say the app is okay but not great, the game is poorly planned and executed for Detroit, and it’s much too expensive for the overall experience.</p>

One of our questions was literally “What was the Ashland Armory used for originally?” The answer? AN ARMORY. 

The app is not well designed or fun. It is very pushy about spending more money and making me share it. If it were fun, I’d happily share it! Please focus on improving the user experience so you have an app worth sharing.</p>

      <p>This is a great concept and has potential to be lots of fun. However the app freezes pretty regularly especially if you are in a service area that is not great. Unfortunately some of the stops are in these areas. I had many calls to customer service to try to unfreeze my phone. We found the only way to do it is to turn the phone off and turn it back on. It got a little old after three times. Wish this was a better app.</p>

Walked to the start point then spent over an hour trying to get my voucher added then when it was added it only gave me enough coins for 2 players. At this point I was just wanted to start so I let that go.  Then when I got to the starting point the app let me check in and that was it.  It let me take a picture then kicked me out.  When I went back on the app to continue my hunt, I had no direction on what to do next so when I hit continue it gave me some points and kicked me out.  Customer service  told me to take the app off my phone and download it again.  At this point at over an hour of trying to figure it out my family (14yr, 12yr, 4yr and husband) were just done.  Customer service said there wasn’t anything wrong with the app and that they couldn’t help me.  No refund. NOTHING!  DONT GET THIS APP might as well just throw your money in the trash!</p>

      <h4>Hunt took my family into a dangerous situation, 1 stars (Ender-R2, Apple App Store, 2021-01-09)</h4>
      <p>I tried this app for the first time today, in Richmond VA.  We had a small group consisting of my household and my sisters, which left us with a bunch of children.  

We wanted to try the hunt on the capitol grounds for the history lesson, but the grounds are barricaded and fenced off.  We found another hunt just a few blocks away and paid for parking and used the token.

The very first clue held lots of graffiti from last summers riots over George Floyd.  Being greeted with ACAB graffiti with the anarchist symbol emblazoned was not well received due to one of the members present being a cop.  He most assuredly isn’t a bastard.  On our way to the next clue, he informed us we were passing an open air drug market, which held a strong odor of marijuana, and several rough looking gentlemen whom color coordinated their wardrobe.  2 of the members of that group followed us for a block before turning back.  

We discontinued the hunt after that.

As an activity that markets itself as being family friendly, this really wasn’t something I wanted to bring four kids under the age of 6 to.  I will not be using this service again</p>

      <p>We tried hard to love this experience but it was not what we are looking for.  
First off getting the team registered was painful, it worked easily on some phones and not at all with others.  We ended up not getting everyone registered and just starting.

For each location there are several puzzles, but they are SO easy, the answers are all in the question.  For example, one question was about a year. Something like “in the 1870’s some event happened, add the digits of the building address to get the last digit in the year”.  You have to enter the entire year, but the interface gives you only four numbers to choose from, and you know the first three are 1-8-7, so the remaining one is the last digit. You don’t even have to look for the building address.  The only challenge is when it asks you to go to the next location, but it just gives you a building name and distance, so you either know the area or you don’t, no logic or puzzle to it.   This had the potential to be SO fun.  We bailed part way through.  Some of the challenges are to take a photo of your team here, which are clearly meant to elicit social media posts for the app.  Good thing for them I am only posting my experience here and not all over my social media.</p>

We did a backyard hunt to start.  What’s impressive is how many things we discovered in our own yard!  My daughters (10 and 15) and husband all were into it.

I’m looking forward to trying it out in our local city and on road trips.</p>

      <p>Exactly how you add family and friends to your hunt in regards to tickets, coins, and vouchers is confusing. 
Also in the app, the fact that anyone can hit “We’re all here” means that others miss out on the challenge if they are not ready or present yet. The leader should be the only one to hit certain progression buttons like Next Location and so forth. 
The app also has no idea what you’re taking pictures of and gives credits to photos of the wrong things. 
Other than that it’s a lot of fun if the weather is nice. It could be improved by having more challenges at each location and include more statues, dedication/information plates, and nameplates on buildings.</p>

We passed so many cool things along the way that could’ve been part of the hunt that we’re not. The developers could make the hunt much much more fun and by adding more features closer together. They should also make some of the things you try to find hard to find. They were all super obvious.</p>

That is not the case at all. It’s the same question for every single player, and if someone’s phone dies, the suggestion from customer support is to quit the challenge.  The font on the screen was so tiny, it is difficult to read. Very cumbersome to set up for multiple players. There is nothing interactive about the app. You are just basically reading things on a screen. I could’ve figured that out just by googling a fountain or something. I wasted $55</p>

      <h4>Battery Drain, 2 stars (BibiDC, Apple App Store, 2019-10-30)</h4>
      <p>We purchased 4 Let’s Roam tickets for the family but primarily for my son to encourage more interactive and educational gaming as a family. My son adores scavenger hunts which is one reason he has found Pokémon Go so enthralling. As it turned out only 2 of us could play on the planned day, but my son and I usually Pokémon together so it was all good. We were both eager to begin the hunt.

We had difficulties connecting him to the game. We called for technical support and received an actual human after very little wait who was able to solve our problem. I had to restart my phone and we signed in all over again, but it worked. Unfortunately, 2 stops into the game, our batteries had drained from 80% to less than 20% in a short time. I provide internet connection for my son allowing him to connect via hotspot. It adds to the power drain but we have always been able to hunt Pokémon this way with few issues. We paused the game (were thankful for the option provided) and stopped for lunch to recharge.

When we tried to resume play, we again experienced technical difficulties. My son was excited to be assigned a special role, he chose photographer and was enjoying taking pictures, but he was unable to reconnect and resume. We again called for tech support, again our problems were resolved quickly, but once again we had to restart the hunt from the beginning. This was frustrating and it wasn’t the last of our technical problems.

We needed a map. While there is one provided in the game, we were unable to zoom in to identify street names. The street name, the distance and a photo were our only clues to locate the next stop. Better maps were available but only through an in-app purchase of coins. I used my Apple Map.

We enjoyed the prompts for pictures, but again had to leave the game app to access our own camera. We were also encouraged to share on social media which required opening another app. Game play slowed significantly and our batteries drained more quickly.

My son enjoyed the mini-games and secondary hunts. He completed 3 or 4 and would have done more, however since these also required the use of our cameras, and our batteries were dying fast, he abandoned these fun tasks.

We stopped one more time to charge our phones. We didn’t mind stopping, we had intended to explore the city and make a day of it. However when we tried to resume and once again my son had trouble reconnecting, our enthusiasm cooled. We continued using only my phone but our interest waned. We abandoned the hunt before it was completed. 

I doubt we’ll redeem our other 2 tickets. That’s an expensive loss. It would be fun if it wasn’t so draining.</p>

      <h4>My favorite app ever made!!, 5 stars (Adyline D, Apple App Store, 2019-10-29)</h4>
      <p>If I could give this a 20 star rating I would. My boyfriend purchased tickets to do a scavenger hunt with Let’s Roam a few months ago. It was probably one of the most fun nights I’ve ever had. I’ve been in Denver for a few years now but never really experienced the city like we did that night. We were able to hit so many cool spots that I didn’t even know existed! I learned so much and had a blast roaming around with my favorite person. I’d definitely 100% recommend Let’s Roam for a fun date night! Especially if you’re looking for something exciting to do for a first date! We try to find any excuse to go on a scavenger hunt these days. When we travel to a new city, it’s so easy to purchase Let’s Roam tickets and start exploring! You can do it anytime and in so many cities across the globe. The app is seamless and if we have any questions the customer service representatives are so nice and helpful! I have only had to call once and they immediately answered my questions.
 
It is such a fun activity no matter what the occasion is. They offer scavenger hunts for date nights, bachelorette parties, team building, and birthdays too! My sister is getting married in a few months and we used Let’s Roam for her bachelorette party. She had a BLAST and now her friends want to do the same thing for their bachelorette parties coming up! Not only does it guide you through the city but it also prompts you and your friends with activities and challenges along the way. It’s a perfect set up for an amazing time.
 
Recently, Let’s Roam launched a dining membership feature too! I LOVE trying new restaurants around the city but it definitely used to put a big hole in my wallet. There are so many amazing restaurants I wanted to hit but would often settle with ramen or a frozen pizza to save some money. With the Let’s Roam Dining Membership, I’ve been able to try 20 new restaurants in the past couple of months! They offer so many different options and have over 50 partnerships with the hottest restaurants in town. I’m definitely giving Let’s Roam Dining Memberships for Christmas gifts this year!</p>

I was super bummed though that there isn’t a hunt in Athens, Greece. That would be amazing! I hope to see Athens, Greece on the hunt map!
Thank you!</p>

      <h4>Pretty unimpressed, 2 stars (rosepetals220, Apple App Store, 2019-03-01)</h4>
      <p>I wanted to do a scavenger hunt for my birthday and so we did one in New Orleans, where we live.  Only,

1.  Most of the directions were super inaccurate.  At one point they took you into a park but not out and the app actually says “most people get lost here and complain”. Well duh, I wonder why. 

2.  They sent us a script for another party because it kept calling our birthday girl (me) by the name Shannan (not my name) 

3.  It kept referring to us as being healthcare workers (we are not) at a company we don’t work for, working together on a group mission for fun (but I thought we were at Shannan’s birthday party??) 

4.  The grammatical errors were off the charts.  I actually kept thinking they just typoed the word “loss” for “lost” until it popped up again (twice) in the survey:  “at any point were you loss because of directions? “ Are you kidding me? 

5.  It made us walk to Pat O’s to start just to send us all the way to the Cathedral.  Just start us at the Cathedral. 

6.  It “ended” at Pat O’s and said “your search is now over have a celebratory drink, congrats you have finished” or some such nonsense so we did and then it had three more stops after that including a headstand!  Don’t make us stop and drink if you want us to do a headstand.  It also affected our time because we wasted it because we thought we were done. 

7. Questions said they were worth 20 points and when we finished them they were worth 50.

8.  More than one question had multiple right answers but would only allow us to select one, making us get the answer wrong.  The Thriller question was just plain wrong and I have no idea what that has to do with a New Orleans scavenger hunt 

9. It took us over a working railroad track and we had to stop and wait for a train.  It also would send us to grassy residential areas and then ask us to take  pictures of a skyscraper and then send us to the CBD and business district and then ask us to headstand on grass. 

Whoever wrote this has no knowledge of New Orleans, how to make a good scanner hunt, or how to write. The app was easy to use and the idea novel but that’s all I can give it credit for. I’m a pro writer and would be happy to rewrite this scavenger hunt for you guys (sorry, Shannan, your birthday is over!)</p>

      <p>I used this app for a bachelorette party this weekend. While it was a great concept, and we had a fun time, this app appears to be very poorly made. 1. The toast makers got no independent challenges 2. It freezes and crashes any time I hit dashboard 3. The game never ended... we still do not know who won 4. There is no one ‘checking’ the answers. 5. Two of the group challenges were extremely similar (asking for a photo of a bird or flying insect then asking for a photo of a black bird) 6. I learned nothing about the city in which we scavenged. 

It really was a waste of 20. I could have put this together for free. I do not recommend at all.</p>

      <p>I had a really good time using the app, but after our hunt, the app continued to harass me with countless pop-ups about leaving a review. Every 5 minutes, another notification comes in. It drained my battery and the only way to stop it was to write this review. Not everyone wants to leave a review and chances are that if you continuously bombard a person to tell you what they think about you, they might have some negative things to share. 

Improvement recommendations: 
1. Option to save photos from hunt directly to gallery. 
2. Be able to share score/summary directly to Facebook, this will be better advertisement than an angry review.</p>

      <h4>Fun but a few recommendations, 4 stars (Etoile34, Apple App Store, 2019-01-02)</h4>
      <p>Purchased this for my family who was visiting from out of town.  Setting it up was pretty straightforward but did have to call and sign out and then back in again to get it working, NBD. 

The review said 2.4 miles of walking, but we didn’t realize it wouldn’t take you back to the starting point, so when we finished we still had 1.5 miles to walk back to the car.  That would have been good to know ahead of time.

The little challenges throughout were fun, but had not thing to do with the location.  Kind of strange.

I noticed a fair number of typos - minor issue, but still.

Overall, this is a fantastic idea and a great way to get people up and moving and using their phones to do so.  Just a few tweaks and it will be perfect!  We will definitely do it again!</p>

      <p>This is a great idea for a scavenger hunt, but it was a very badly designed app. If you accidentally log out, you cannot get back in without using another ticket. It is difficult to find how to make different teams, and just very confusing. I was scared to close my phone in case it logged me out and got rid of my ticket. The hunt itself is not riddles, just directions to see things and easy questions. This whole experience in no way meet our expectations.</p>

      <p>My friends and I did the scavenger hunt in Dallas and were highly disappointed. Interesting idea, poorly executed. There were quite a few spelling mistakes, not many interesting facts, and could have included more interesting places. Additionally, I could not even use the app on my phone. It requires the user to purchase coins to receive a ticket. I was charged three times for the coins because the “server was down.” After all that, I did not even receive any coins. I had to call for a refund the following day, which was perhaps the only pleasant experience I had with this app. I’m not sure why it has received such a high rating. Overall, could have been a really fun experience but turned out to be another poorly executed app.</p>

      <p>We got this as a fun activity to do with the family. For what we paid for, it ran horribly and was unclear and confusing. The app has access to the GPS, so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t notify us when we got to each landmark. Not only that, but once we got to the landmark, it was unclear what was a question for the team and what was a challenge for the individual. As a result, we missed half the questions because we didn’t know if it was a challenge or part of the game. It was a waste of money and you’ll have more fun walking around the city looking up and around, rather than looking at your phone.</p>

      <h4>Fun game, but weak ending., 2 stars (Billybobjon, Apple App Store, 2018-12-21)</h4>
      <p>Did the Plano, TX scavenger hunt, and was really enjoying it for a good amount of time. It was fun, informative, and a great activity to do with the family.

However, about halfway through the hunt, the scavenger locations started to get further and further apart, and weren’t nearly as interesting as the locations in the first half (like, the final destination asked a question about the color of the slides at a park, as opposed to earlier questions being about historical landmarks). 

The real kicker was the scavenger hunt ended a mile and a half from the starting point (where our car is located). So, instead of looping us back to the start point, the hunt left us over a mile away from our car, standing next to a busy road in a town we’re very unfamiliar with (we drove in from a town about 30 minutes away to try it out). We were expecting the route to loop back, and when it didn’t we were sorely disappointed. Would have been a nice heads up to know the route didn’t loop. Ended taking a Lyft back.

All this to say, I think I’d give the app one more try, as it was pretty fun for the first half. I won’t be recommending to friends yet, and if the second time isn’t great I probably won’t do it again, but it’s worth a shot because it’s a good concept.</p>

      <p>Forget the unproductive dating apps. Forget the apathetic movie dates. Forget the boring dinner dates. I think you get my point...Let’s Roam is the best way to meet your true love!!!

My date Michel suggested Let’s Roam for our first date, and I had no idea what would possibly happen during a scavenger hunt. I expected that we would have a typical treasure map where we found random things...in attempts to keep ourselves busy and avoid the awkwardness of a first date. 

BUT I was SO wrong! 

Michel and I learned so much about the city I had lived in for years (when I thought I had known it all) and laughed the entire time from reading the quirky messages after solving each mission. Also, the romantic photo challenges allowed us to be closer and re-enact cute scenarios, and I now have several adorable photos of us that I will cherish forever! In addition to lots of laughter and wonderful photos, the challenges throughout the hunt helped facilitate meaningful conversations that helped us really get to know each other...and made me realize that I have finally found the one!

Let’s Roam really exceeded my expectations in all aspects, and I can’t wait to explore more of world with my honey using this app! :) I hope you all get a chance to try it as well! Maybe you’ll find a new love, strengthen the relationships you already have made, or more!</p>

      <h4>Annoying yet Fun, 3 stars (@kicktheball, Apple App Store, 2018-11-02)</h4>
      <p>Did this as a team work outing. It’s a great way to see how people do or so not work together. If you are a rule follower and/or like to win you will probably blow a gasket, because guess what, not everyone on your team cares about rules and winning! Customer support was awesome to us as we dealt with log in issues but we all had fun and their were no serious fights, lol. Hint: follow directions, even though they are vague. 3 stars because every minute I get a prompt to review the app. So I’m reviewing the app already! Otherwise 5 stars b/c it’s a great social experiment and team building barometer.</p>

      <p>This Scavenger Hunt was so much fun! We had two teenagers with us and they enjoyed it as well. It took us through parts of DC that we don’t normally visit and the areas were not crowded with tourists. We learned lots of fun facts about history and architecture too. Only issue was not getting our score until 2 days after we finished and even then, we didn’t get to see stats from other hunts. It would great for you to have a leaderboard for comparison. Will definitely do one of these hunts again!</p>

      <h4>Worth a try, 4 stars (Moodygreyjeans, Apple App Store, 2018-10-01)</h4>
      <p>It’s definitely something you want to do with the right people. My friend was very game for one of the “hard” challenges. 

There are lightning rounds, photo challenges, and depending on the character role you choose, you may or may not like your personal challenges. There’s also a bonus map challenge you can do along with the main hunt. You don’t need to finish everything, just the main hunt.

So think of this as 3 challenges during one hunt. I got to catchup with my friend, and we learned some new things. She was the ‘explorer’ and got very literal challenges, while I decided to be the ‘youngster’ and got very vague challenges.

What I really hope gets improved on is the glitchiness. App definitely froze at the end, leaving a blank page. We really wanted to know our scores. It’s finally visible now after 24 hours. Also don’t see any option to share the hunt or photos, despite the share button, it doesn’t work. Possibility that it only works during the hunt and not after?

Would love to share everything with my friend; since I saw there’s a code to share hunt w/friends, but I didn’t see the app code pop up when I redeemed our tickets. Maybe I missed something when I skimmed the video, but there also aren’t that many options on the app, so hard to miss.

Definitely 5 stars when this doesn’t give me a blank page and I can share pics.</p>

      <h4>Uninspiring, Boring. Poorly executed., 1 stars (Wonderland55a, Apple App Store, 2018-09-24)</h4>
      <p>I thought this would entertain a few 5th & 6th graders and their parents, but it was very dull. Worse, it requires a Facebook or google ID to sign in (which my children don’t have) This was not disclosed until after the download! There was very few interesting factoids, much less actual history which could have been easily incorporated. The app itself wasn’t intuitive, so there was added confusion of what to do & why different players had different screens (I think of one player read a question and tapped an answer, other players would miss the question altogether and might be directed to the next location without realizing it - no way to go back and see the sequence or questions). There was a lot of walking to very random things. (Which is fine for a scavenger hunt) but there could be been more things in between. 

we never understood the ‘roles’ I think each might get different sub questions? 

Don’t bother - much too expensive for what it is. Great idea, poorly written. lazy execution.</p>

      <p>The app was nice and the information and walk around was good. But, the photo challenges didn’t work. Once I took a pic, it had no way to submit it. And, the pics weren’t saved on my phone’s images. 

Plus, like a previous entry, I click “finish” to end it and get score and the app went blank. 

Disappointed.</p>

I would recommend doing it in the early morning or evening as it was very hot and all outdoors. We had to pause the game several times to get drinks. And it ended quite far from where it began so that was a little shocking. But still a fun thing to do.</p>
