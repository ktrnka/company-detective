        <h1>About Exa</h1>
<p>Exa, previously known as Metaphor Systems, is a San Francisco-based startup that specializes in developing advanced search technologies tailored for AI applications. The company was co-founded by Will Bryk and Jeff Wang, who met during their freshman year at Harvard. Exa's mission is to revolutionize information retrieval by moving beyond traditional keyword-based search engines like Google, utilizing a neural search engine that understands queries semantically for more accurate and relevant results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/">(Bort, TechCrunch, July 16, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Exa's primary product is its semantic search engine, which is designed to handle complex queries and provide contextually relevant information. This technology is particularly beneficial for AI applications that require precise data retrieval. The company offers several services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Web Researcher</strong>: A tool for finding hard-to-locate information using natural language queries, powered by web-scale vector search.</li>
<li><strong>Websets</strong>: A service that enriches data by automatically adding critical information to search results.</li>
<li><strong>Company Researcher</strong>: Provides detailed research information about companies.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Contact Discovery</strong>: Helps users find verified contact information for prospects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exa's technology is utilized by various organizations, including EvaBot and Databricks, highlighting its value in sales research and obtaining high-quality data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/">(Bort, TechCrunch, July 16, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $22 million, including a $17 million Series A funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Nvidia’s NVentures and Y Combinator.

<p>Exa serves thousands of developers and offers a free tier for individual users, allowing up to 1,000 search requests per month. The company is focused on building a robust infrastructure, including a $5 million GPU cluster for processing and training its models <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/exa-raises-17m-lightspeed-nvidia-ycombinator-google-ai-models/">(Bort, TechCrunch, July 16, 2024)</a>.</p>
