      <p>Been over a year since my review, since they keep asking for another one here it is. nothing has changed! Still the tightest casino games on the internet with frequent disconnects, low payouts, low gift spins, slow response time to complaints, free spin awards of 0 chips, when they do respond refuse to admit there might have been a malfunction in their game or to make it right. Extremely slow loading, especially when free chips are involved, if it loads at all</p>

      <p>The problem with these apps and that's for mostly slot apps is when you bet bigger bets the large bets it never hits bonuses if it does it gives you shity bonuses and you don't get any good line hits it's rigged and it's a scam it's a cheat they just want you to buy coins. I just played The Fabulous Freedom game and played over 2 million coins at 200,000 and it only paid me $8,000 out of 2 million plus. In 20 spins that is so wrong just makes you not want to play & uninstall the app</p>

I just recently spent 40 bucks for 30 million coins here’s how it went.   37 spins zero wins 38th I got my bet back 41 spins zero wins 42 got my net back then spun out to zero coins.  All this in 5 minutes.  So 40 bucks got me 4 minutes of playing time where I spun over 80 times winning my bet back twice then broke.  I’ll let you decide how fair this app is cause I feel robbed and I’m shocked apple sticks by all of this.</p>

I understand that $300 worth of chips won’t last a week, but it’s been more like an hour in the last year. Sad. Well made, well done, but I just can’t continue to lose like this.

      <p>I used to love this game. Played several times a day to fill some time and relax. Why do you have challenges that require a high bet to achieve? Then they change things..I don’t mind trying to complete challenges for chips to help with the play cost, but sure as you start doing that, it became much more of a higher bet to earn an orb or complete a stage for those rewards. Getting a bingo ball as an aside challenge, that too changed, where the minimum bet in order to even qualify for being eligible for a bingo ball, went way up. I get inflation all around us, but come on…not when you are gambling. Double down is pricing themselves right out of fun and relaxing to expensive and unattainable. Constant emails for 250 or 300 chips, is really becoming not worth the time to stop and click on those promos. If you want to win, you really have to play minimum or higher and they keep raising that up… with all the competition out there now…there are better choices that don’t hold you hostage ,</p>

 Two other times, I wrote and they were kind enough to return the tokens. This week, I hit the max button almost immediately after i purchased (by accident!!!)  and they would not refund.  I would not purchase until they take the max option off any and all games!!!!</p>

      <p>They don’t pay out true money, they are rigging the games so you don’t win and have to keep purchasing coins!  To me it’s a scam!!! Getting rich while we get poorer!  I will say the games are fun and it does keep me sane most days, I can’t afford to pay everyday! It’s true they give you free coins but the games are rigged to take it back within 3 spins before the pop up to purchase more coins come and if you don’t buy any coins they will make sure lose any remaining coins that may have left, when that purchase coins pop up I suggest you stop playing because they will take any coins you have left! Even though I don’t to want leave this game but it’s best for my pockets and my health! Ex: I can have 200,000,000 coins and with 2 hours it’s gone, winning small amounts in between!!!!</p>

      <h4>Now You Must Sign In Everytime You Open This App 😵‍💫, 1 stars (Stageplay, Apple App Store, 2024-09-21)</h4>
      <p>This is crazy: Now, instead of keeping you signed in so you can just open the app every time you want to play it, you are now required to sign in every single time you open the app! What has that done? Well, it has certainly discouraged people from using the app. I have several friends who play the app, and we would exchange "gifts" in the app every day. Not anymore. I might get 2 to 4 of them now. This means that the number of people using the app has dropped a lot, simply because it requires you to sign in every time. Pretty stupid move, Double Down. I imagine you are losing players like crazy now.
I contacted them about it and received a canned generic email from them that did not even address the question. It had one suggestion that was a possibility, to delete the app and re-install it, so I tried that. It made no difference. So, apparently this is not a glitch! Apparently, they now purposely want us to sign in every single time we open the app. I am considering quitting this app now, even though I have played it for years. Other casinos don’t require you to sign in every time you open the app. That used to be the case with Double Down Casino, too. Not anymore.</p>

      <h4>Finally!! A Scarab Bonus Round!, 3 stars (Flacoinohio, Apple App Store, 2024-09-19)</h4>
      <p>On December 25, 2020 I played Scarab and won a Bonus round. I was only betting $36k per spin so the win was only $236k. Today, March 5, 2024 I played Scarab as I have for the past 53 days and finally spun a Bonus round, in fact I won a second round during the first round of spins! I bet $1.5 million per spin today when the first Bonus came up. It’s ironic my winnings amounted to $236 million credits. I chose the five spin option with ten Scarab wild icons being put in each spin. I have not spun a Bonus round in the Scarab game for 4 years, 2 months, and 5 days. Its amazing how long it takes to get a Bonus Round in the Scarab game. I am betting the next 8-15 ten spin rounds will produce no winning spins, wild scarab icons, or princess icons, and my current winnings will be gone. Here’s to counting how long it takes to spins another Bonus round! Now I am eager to see how much longer it takes to spin a full screen of Princess icons, I haven’t seen one of those since the game was first released. I just bought the $39.99 package and it says it’s two days of bonus spins. Two days means 48 hours to me, I didn’t get 48 hours the last three times. I had 1 day and 2 hours at 3:47 PM this afternoon. At 4:30 Am my bonus spin time was over. You all owe me some free spins or more time. Your not giving 24 or 48 hours.  The card collecting game makes no sense either.  I started a new card collecting game and after collecting 5 cards, I only received those same cards for a month.  Then got 7 in a row to 12 and again got zero new cards until I spent real money buying play credits.  After spending $1million or more on spins I won for a minute or two and earned 85 cards I have won cards 37 times and earned no new cards.</p>

      <p>I’ve been playing since this game came out. It use to be so much fun and you could actually win but something has definitely changed now. I keep the company more rich as much as I spend and I can’t do it anymore. So frustrating!!!
I love playing DDC but buying the 99.00 dollar package to lose it within 15 minutes is ridiculous. I understand DDC has to make money but good grief loosen up the slots some. They tell you not to bet so much and I’ve tried that too but they still don’t pay off. In the economy we live in now I have got to stop buying the packages. 

Thanks DDC for the years of fun but I’m at the point it’s time to delete the app and find something else to play.</p>

You can go broke playing a single slot waiting for it to hit.if you favorite machines are cold, go into the casino and play cards……</p>

      <p>I have to agree with a lot of these reviews. I have been pretty for several years and have learned to not expect more than two weeks of winning and then three weeks of losing. I’m a retired old lady and on a fixed income and can’t afford to buy extra chips, so I just play with what comes up. But it’s disappointing when you haven’t played for a couple of hours only to find you have been disconnected and your time bonus won’t go past 20K. 
Also I can’t sign up for extra because I get a message that my email is already registered. 
I do enjoy playing, but you ask for a review so there it is.</p>

      <p>I wrote a good review months ago and have a change of opinion. I never spend money on games except this one. You would think that when you purchase $100 worth of chips, you would win something. I have been playing over a week since my last purchase and am soon going to have to buy more if I want to continue to play. I am tired of never winning and it just isn’t fun anymore when you take take take. 
Another issue…the wonder cards. How long does this have to drag out. I have had many that are one away from completion but the game is over and that is never accomplished! Come on Double Down, step up you game!</p>

      <p>I’ve played DD casino for years and really, you can’t expect to win all of the time. After all, they do offer a real casino experience😕. Lately though, it seems that wins are few and far between and not so much fun anymore. What happened?  Additionally, I have experienced a lot more technical problems like freeze ups or spinning into infinity that require exiting the app.  I also get many Load Game failures while linking from an emailed invitation. Today, I received free spins by email which began ok but about mid-way the game continued spinning without stopping so I closed the app. When I logged on again the remainder of free spins were gone?</p>

      <p>I’ve invested thousands over 10 years and have never felt like I was really winning. I think unless you play millions at a time, you don’t win. I think the “contests” to play certain games to win are set to let only the really big bettors win! They sell packages of chips for people who bet big (really big, like over several hundred million) so that makes me think that you might favor the big bettors more than the smaller betters like me. Do you rotate the winners equally? I mean, do as many smaller bettors win as often as bigger bettors win? I like the games: they’re fun, entertaining and usually interesting. I just don’t like the percentage of payouts for us smaller bettors!</p>

      <h4>Game keeps getting worse with time, 2 stars (saclark1, Apple App Store, 2024-09-10)</h4>
      <p>Update: most of their popular games now put a play the maximum amount button right next to your normal play button which makes it extremely easy for you to hit the play and think you're only betting a lower amount and you end up sucking all your millions out after one or two plays. It's a stupid thing to do and I'm sure they know it but they also know that they'll catch enough people accidentally bumping that button and emptying their purse with the intent to get them to buy more. Very deceptive.

so, tell me, in what universe does any slot game not pay off at all when you have three bars on the left wheel of fortune in the middle and three bars on the right? Answer double down casino! In any other casino game this would've paid handsomely, especially when you're betting $420,000 per pull. this happened once before a few weeks ago and I landed on the exact same combination and it did not pay either. Time to look for another game as this one is full of bugs.</p>

      <p>Update— Sept 9th 2024-
Ps, did you guys change management or did you just became more greedy?? Huge difference with couple of years ago when winnings and playing the games were still fun. 
It’s a true shame that you guys have awsome slots but lousy payouts. 
Love the emails for free cash and free spins and I don’t mind buying chips every now and then, BUT: 
Free spins are RIDICULOUS: (on a 12k amount chosen by the app ) and then you win 6,600 in 30 spins, seriously??
It’s not even worth my time to wait for the free spins to be over☹️😖. 
There is only (Low) winning amounts on low spins like 10-15k and loosing is all too easy so I’m afraid I will have to delete the game AGAIN for a couple of years and again find a different game that will actually PAY OUT.  What a shame because there are só many games that I love but the payouts stink, where are the jackpots??
———————————————————————————

Update Aug 8th 2024- Game still freezes in piggy game, winning is hard and when you win you lose it faster than the speed of light that is SUCH a shame😞😖 Winnings are bad, you only win big when your bet amount is tiny, never ever won thé jackpot☹️. Played it for years, deleted it cause I got SO frustrated by not winning big, installed again couple of months ago and feel same way now..
Signed up for emails again, free money and free spins.</p>

      <p>This app is a scam. It’s regulated on how much you spend do not buy into it. There are much better games out there to play that don’t cost you as much. They have this game set at 95% loss or greater they treated as if you’re playing with a chance to win real money and I’ve played games that you can win money on that don’t cost near as much. Double down and I GT are not about providing entertainment at a low cost.  it’s high cost to play them with very little return.</p>

Now I have quit playing the missions and just play for fun, if a slot doesn’t win, I just move along and collect the bonuses.

      <p>Double Down has the best slot games available. We really enjoy playing but I don’t understand why there are limits on the amount of free coins to collect. Also if we buy the tokens we want an opportunity to play. On too many occasions through too many games you can throw away 150 to 200 million tokens in a single evening. After spending $100 and NOT having any fun it causes one to wonder if they will bother purchasing more in the future. 
Too many nights the games are too tight. Eventually people will find something better to do if the opportunity to play and win no longer makes sense.</p>

Thanks for the wins. But I do wish there were more adult like machines.  Not kitty cats, honey bears, mermaids and Harley pigs.  
I stay away from those. Other people like them but I feel like it’s a child’s game. More real to life people in kids games. Just a suggestion. Most of us are seniors.</p>

      <p>This is a computer generated casino and they can change the method on payout by flipping the switch. I play often my favorite is the Mermaid and the Piggy what’s amazing about the Mermaid is if your bet is below 
One million you will get the jackpot for a minor but you don’t qualify for it. So you have to bet a million or more in order to qualify for Jackpot minor but you will never get the jackpot minor because they have programmed it out and they will say that’s not so but I’ve ran this so many times and it just does not appear, This is a man made computer program but it is programmed to take you to the cleaners. And They have really gone down hill on this happy hour that is a joke. It can be entertaining at times but I think they too many so called slots and the good slots have been reprogrammed so many times like the Piggy slot 
This slots has changed drastically.</p>

Even buying a substantial amount of coins, which I am totally against but did it to see if there was a difference, they take back everything and it forces you to lose.  Not an uplifting, fun game at all. I’m deleting this game, it’s a downer and a farce because you can never win big prizes! And the free coins they give you are so small…you would have to collect for days to play their daily/weekly challenge. Don’t play this game…go to Slotomania instead, you have more fun with no purchasing of coins!</p>

      <p>Double Down is on a roll.  Lost a Class Action Lawsuit, had to refund money to customers and is now trying to get it all back.  I am a Sapphire member and I am getting a $150,000 bonus per day when betting over 10x that amount each spin.  I’ve never seen a game that is just there to take as much money as possible and then congratulate me on winning a nominal amount and ask for a good rating.  This is supposed to be a fun game but for Double Down it’s how much are you willing to pay to play our games? Just know that they will take it all, time and time again! If you complain about how much you are losing they will tell you that you are on a losing streak, they just don’t tell you that it is how they have programmed their games….to take it all.</p>

Then it quickly goes away. They throw you a few “free” coins daily to get you hooked again and those quickly disappear. Then you want to play more so you buy more. The cycle continues yet again. No wonder there are multi million dollar lawsuits against this app. If you enjoy throwing money away it’s definitely the app for you.</p>

I play for four minutes then it’s time to put everything away and go back to work I come here for Texas tea and nothing but Texas tea and it forces me to click on 8 to 12 things before I can get to the chance to play any game and then it puts me in high stakes and wants me to big millions of dollars at a time which I have never ever done but the game doesn’t know anything that I do and forces me to close 8 to 10 windows before I can get to the game. It’s hard to get out of high stakes by the way there’s no way to do it unless you close the game and start over again. So if I have a break at work, I choose heyday. Heyday works every time.

      <p>I can say emphatically 100% with truth and honesty that this is the worst gaming app on the Internet.
The ABSOLUTE WORST!
Double Down REFUSES to listen to the people that go to their site and experience playing on it. 
They absolutely refused to listen. 
When you write them and tell them that you’re not winning, that they keep everything too tight and very controlled-THEY DON’T ANSWER TO IT.
They just send you a form letter thanking you for your opinion. 
They’ll say, for example, Sorry you’re having this experience.
But they don’t address what you’re actually telling them. 
They just dismiss it. 
And that’s because of one reason: And that reason is because they’re never going to change anything.
 And that’s because they like it the way it is. They like it the way that it is, nice and tightly controlled by them-so that THEY, 
Double  Down-are the ones who are doing the winning-Not you—-THEM.
They know this! 
They know it full well. 
And they hate when you call them out on it!
But how 100% true it is that THEY are the ones making the money.
NOT YOU. 
Have you ever heard of a casino where you go in to play and you’ll never even have the remotest chance of winning any money- just points.
But yet they, (Double Down ) are the ones actually making the actual cash.
I love how they call their points, “chips“.
When you win, the very few times that they let you win, you’re winning points, and all these points are good for us just to continue to play their games. but yet they call them “chips“. 
What it really comes down to is what they’re saying to you is… Hey! If you like our games, you can play a little bit for free with the little bit of pittance points we give you. But if you want to continue to play if you run out of points, then you’re going to have to purchase them from us!
So what they’re saying is…… You pay us cash… And will give you more points to play our games, where you’ll win nothing but points if you do win, but never any cash. It’s just us who gets the cash!
Does that make any sense to you?
But yet… This is what they get away with doing. 
That’s why when you call them out on it… All they will ever say is, Well….thank you for your opinion. Thank you for your feedback. And go on to completely dismiss what you’re telling them and not address it at all.
Don’t be fooled by all their little colorful little, pretty cartoon characters with all their different colors that look so sweet and benevolent. Don’t by that,  because the truth is-is that they are a totally vicious, vicious company, who are greedy and money, hungry  to the core and to the absolute max!
And they can never deny it.</p>

It would be nice if periodically they would give a decent payout instead of me continually feeding the bank.

      <p>First off, this is my favorite games to play! But I am disappointed that I constantly lose. The coin packages are not a good value for the money. When I do buy a package I still don’t win and out of coins right away. It’s annoying to get a bonus and not win anything, it says “congratulations on your “0” win! “. It would be great if the pay offs were better. Thanks for your time!</p>

      <p>Too cumbersome with looking for games previously played because screen goes back to the “beginning” instead of going to the game where you left off.  

I only have a few favorites like Pixie  Fairies; all the the Piggy’s games; wheel of Fortune games.. but I cannot arrange or edit my “ favorites”.

I play these games as “break” from my caregiving responsibilities for my senior brother.. I enjoy it, but it has lessened the rewards amount… and I’m missing the one that’s played like monopoly.</p>

      <p>I see that a lot of people say that the payout is tight. I totally agree. You say that the more you play the better you win. Intro the more you play the faster you lose your money. I’ve been playing double down for almost 20 years. I guess seems like forever, and I’m kind of tired of losing and having to pay to play. I think I’m just done with double down unless you change your ways.</p>

      <p>I don’t know why I keep playing Double Down! I buy chips almost daily. If I start with 12 million chips, it only lasts me usually less than five minutes. The daily bonus chips are usually always 75,000 to 100,000 that doesn’t even buy you one spin in the high limit room every once in a while, I will get a big win, but it will be gone in a half hour. If you could just win enough chips to play a little while it would be so much better. It’s not a lot of fun to lose within five minutes. I know Double down wants you to buy more chips, but that is my maximum every day and I’m gonna have to quit doing that</p>

      <p>Slots are fun, and the game could be great. Don’t ever pay these people one dime. You tend to win when when your bets are in the 10-20k range, but as soon as you get into higher amounts you can go for 50 or more spins without ever getting back more than your bet. They make the daily challenges almost impossible unless you buy chips. It doesn’t matter how much you start with they will just make you lose even more. Horribly greedy game, that hopefully has cost itself lots of profits by taking away people’s chances to play for a while before losing their money.</p>

Then you give us 30 free spins at 10 per spin and you might get 90 to 100k in 30 spins. My idea would be 20 free spins at 50 per spin. That would help those who can’t play for much. I have spent a lot of money over the last 15 years. I love this app but am considering uninstalling it. Thank you Julia Cook aka as Judy Cook.</p>

      <p>If you are wanting to play these slot games, Your odds are the same at a real casino, and at least then you can win some real money. The app has said they want to give a “real casino experience.” If we wanted that, we would go to a real casino. This is an online game that is supposed to be fun, not so frustrating. 

This app hardly gives any free coins and is very tight with its wins so you have to constantly buy more. 

I really wanted to like this app since it has some great games, but it is just not worth it. I fave it 2 stars instead of 1 just because it has fun games. If you don’t mind spending $100s a month in fake coins to play then you will like this app.</p>

By spending 100.00 for chips and it only last you 3 days is a rip off. I found this poker place a lot better and it only cost you 40.00 for 3 billion chips. This place thinks we’re all millionaires but we’re not. I just find it hard to believe them people with billions of chips are even real there not. I have been pink diamond forever after spending a 100.00 almost every month, i just don’t think you can ever get ahead. I am done with place. They just got so greedy so no more of my money.</p>

      <p>I played slots in real casinos, where the payoff is not that tight, you play 3 million in coins or credits and only win cherry’s or a couple of uneven bars, who ever set it up didn’t know what the heck they were doing. To buy coins would be out of question, you steal the free ones, so you most likely will steal the ones that are purchased . I’ve played hundreds of machines at casinos for many years and who ever set this up didn’t know anything ❣️❣️</p>

      <p>I like getting free $ to play in text and email. Not only is it fun to play free spins but it also shows me which slots are nearly impossible to win so I dont spend my $$ there. When playing from my phone I found it is too easy to hit the Max Bet button without realizing it. On some slots it's where the AUTO button is. On three separate occasions I wiped out my bank and had to build it back up again.  Also I have hit for more than 20x bet in base play on multiple occasions and have never won an orb</p>

      <p>I Have been playing these games for many years. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of purchasing chips. That is when everything went downhill. I don’t know how, but I rarely win (if ever) any jackpots, which makes it no fun at all! Trust me, if you don’t buy chips, you’ll win more often. Disappointing! Such a shame! I used to love these games. I guess I’m going to have to delete the app. After so many years, I will miss it.
I’m not surprised that DD was sued and lost! It is nothing more than a scam now</p>
