        <h1>About Carbon Robotics</h1>
<p>Carbon Robotics, founded on January 1, 2018, is a Seattle-based company specializing in AI-powered robotics aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity. The company is renowned for its flagship product, the LaserWeeder, which uses advanced technology such as computer vision, AI, and lasers to identify and eliminate weeds with precision. This innovation allows farmers to reduce costs, improve crop quality, and adopt sustainable farming practices <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maka-autonomous-robots">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The LaserWeeder is designed to operate without chemical herbicides, hand labor, or soil disruption, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional weeding methods. It can target weeds with sub-millimeter accuracy, killing up to 300,000 weeds per hour and covering 2 acres per hour at 1 mph. The product is versatile, working on over 100 crops and all types of weeds in various soil conditions, and is certified organic <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">(Carbon Robotics, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Carbon Robotics serves a diverse range of agricultural customers, including Hungenberg Produce Co., Kerr Farms, Carzalia Farm, Grimmway Farms, and Duncan Family Farms.

        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>"This is LaserWeeder from Carbon Robotics. It uses AI technology to detect weeds and kill them with lasers." <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">(GrabWorking3045, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Sentiment Towards Technology</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Creating implements that totally give the finger to 'em: what a great idea." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33coaj/">(QuietlyGardening, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"This seems like an absolute game changer if the whole tractor/laser setup costs less than $500k." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjx1sz/">(Giblet_, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"I hope this takes off." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjddgg/">(thequiethunter, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It looks good.... But it is not practical... That looks like it covering about 6 or maybe 9 meters. And it's traveling pretty slow 2 / 3kmph." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjda46/">(shortass12321, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"This technology will kill this technology. That unit probably costs way more than a sprayer, and the energy bill it creates is undoubtedly gargantuan." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjmcbq/">(ironfist221, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>"It costs about 3X what a typical 50 HP tractor costs, so that's going to be an issue in the short term." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k34qto8/">(yes_its_him, Reddit, 2023-10-02)</a></li>
<li>"Cost is another major factor. Spray rig + chems vs this cannot even be close in costs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqix6q8/">(BigHobbit, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"It could be. After the initial cost and the price of the fuel for the inevitable generator, it's lower maintenance than a sprayer." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqinpsi/">(w1987g, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Practicality and Efficiency</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I work in this field and one issue I haven’t seen brought up in the comments so far is that the technology is far, far slower than typical herbicide spray applications." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqj0zra/">(Visual_Mission1223, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"I’d be more worried about the herbicide companies since it’s not zapping bugs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqin4qc/">(Shit_Shepard, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"The real question is.... Will farmers be allowed to repair it themselves when it inevitably breaks down?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqihfrg/">(Vulcan_MasterRace, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparisons with Other Technologies</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Nope it has been stated that ev tractors are not good for soil due to weight and short battery life." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/lppnlyq/">(Resident-Donkey-6808, Reddit, 2024-09-30)</a></li>
<li>"Electric tractors would be awesome and you get a built in ballast weight in the batteries." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31ff36/">(NBABUCKS1, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"I could see smaller autonomous specialised ones for specific purposes, but ploughing and planting harvesting I can’t see them being any good for that with current tech." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31nevr/">(SnooPears754, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
