        <h1>About Carbon Robotics</h1>
<p>Carbon Robotics, founded on January 1, 2018, is a Seattle-based company specializing in AI-powered robotics for agriculture. The company is renowned for its flagship product, the LaserWeeder™, which uses advanced technology to enhance farming efficiency by identifying and eliminating weeds without the use of chemical herbicides. This innovation is particularly beneficial for both conventional and organic farmers, as it reduces labor needs and increases crop yield <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">(Carbon Robotics, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company operates primarily in the B2B sector, targeting farmers and agricultural businesses. Carbon Robotics generates revenue through the sale and distribution of its LaserWeeder and related services. The company has raised a total of $157 million in funding, with the latest round being a $70 million Series D announced in October 2024. This funding is intended to scale the LaserWeeder business, expand manufacturing capabilities, and support geographic expansion into Eastern and Southern Europe and the Asia-Pacific region <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/carbon-robotics-brings-in-70m-to-scale-laserweeder/">(The Robot Report, 2024)</a>.</p>
