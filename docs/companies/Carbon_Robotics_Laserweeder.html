        <h1>About Carbon Robotics</h1>
<p>Carbon Robotics, founded in 2018 and headquartered in Seattle, Washington, is a pioneering company in the agricultural technology sector. The company specializes in AI-powered farming solutions, with a focus on innovative robotics designed to enhance modern farming practices. Carbon Robotics launched its first product, the Autonomous LaserWeeder™, in April 2021, and has since developed the commercial LaserWeeder™. The company has raised a total of $80 million in funding, with significant investments from notable venture capital firms, including a recent $43 million round to support product development and international expansion <a href="https://fruitgrowersnews.com/news/carbon-robotics-releases-laserweeder-with-tracks/">(Fruit Growers News, 2024-02-27)</a>.</p>
<h2>Products and Services</h2>
<h3>LaserWeeder™</h3>
<p>The LaserWeeder is an advanced agricultural tool that utilizes AI, deep learning, and high-powered lasers for precision weed control. It features 42 high-resolution cameras for weed identification and 30X 150W CO2 lasers with sub-millimeter accuracy. The LaserWeeder operates day and night, capable of eliminating over 100,000 weeds per hour, and works on over 100 crops, including vegetables and herbs. It is certified organic and has been reported to cut weed control costs by up to 80% <a href="https://www.globalaginvesting.com/nventures-backs-carbon-robotics-ai-powered-laser-weeder/">(Global AgInvesting, 2024-05-08)</a>.</p>
<h3>Carbon Operator App</h3>
<p>This app allows farmers to monitor and control the LaserWeeder in real-time, providing metrics on crop and weed performance.</p>
