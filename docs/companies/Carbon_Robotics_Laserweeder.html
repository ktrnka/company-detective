        <h1>About Carbon Robotics</h1>
<p>Carbon Robotics, founded on January 1, 2018, is a Seattle-based company specializing in AI-powered agricultural technology. The company is renowned for its flagship product, the LaserWeeder™, which uses advanced AI, computer vision, and laser technology to identify and eliminate weeds without harming crops. This innovation aims to enhance farming efficiency and sustainability by reducing reliance on chemical herbicides and manual labor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maka-autonomous-robots">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>The company operates primarily in the B2B sector, serving over 100 growers across North America, Europe, and Australia. These customers benefit from significant cost savings and operational efficiency improvements, as the LaserWeeder can reportedly save up to 80% on weeding costs and perform the work of 75 farm workers <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/press-release/carbon-robotics-named-to-the-2024-cnbc-disruptor-50-list">(CNBC, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>
<p>Carbon Robotics has raised a total of $157 million in venture capital, with notable investors including NVIDIA’s NVentures, BOND Capital, and Anthos Capital. The company was named to the 2024 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, highlighting its rapid growth and transformative impact on the agricultural sector <a href="https://www.silicon.co.uk/press-release/carbon-robotics-named-to-the-2024-cnbc-disruptor-50-list">(CNBC, 2024-05-14)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Sentiments on Carbon Robotics and Laserweeder</h2>
<h3>Skepticism about Technology and Practicality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I could see smaller autonomous specialised ones for specific purposes, but ploughing and planting harvesting I can’t see them being any good for that with current tech." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31nevr/">(reddanit, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"Cool concept, but I don't see how in the next 10-15 years battery tech advances enough to replace a tractor with 1000 liters of fuel tank designed to operate 12 hours under stress without needing to stop for refill." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k345pfl/">(TheWipyk, Reddit, 2023-10-02)</a></li>
<li>"Tractors are a terrible application for EV tech unless we're talking about small auxiliary tractors not used for full field work." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31atjy/">(btone911, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"This seems way too expensive to ever be practical on a large scale but what do I know." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqiruc2/">(chunkah69, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"The technology is far, far slower than typical herbicide spray applications." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqj0zra/">(Visual_Mission1223, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"Looks good.... But it is not practical... That looks like it covering about 6 or maybe 9 meters. And it's traveling pretty slow 2 / 3kmph." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjda46/">(shortass12321, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Concerns about Industry Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Every once in a while… An absolutely amazing tech is created… I hope the herbicide/pesticide giants don’t try and kill this." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqic9pn/">(pigsgetfathogsdie, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>

<li>"This technology will kill this technology. That unit probably costs way more than a sprayer, and the energy bill it creates is undoubtedly gargantuan." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjmcbq/">(ironfist221, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed Feelings on Electric and Autonomous Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Electric tractors would be awesome and you get a built in ballast weight in the batteries." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31ff36/">(NBABUCKS1, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"The ability to simply refuel from your truck's diesel tank in the bed is a key feature." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31atjy/">(btone911, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"I think it should have been first, frankly: a lot of farmers/ranchers are REALLY ready to stick it RIGHT TO Deere/Catepillar, et al with the heinous 'right to repair' problem." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33coaj/">(QuietlyGardening, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>

<li>"It could be. After the initial cost and the price of the fuel for the inevitable generator, it's lower maintenance than a sprayer." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqinpsi/">(w1987g, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
