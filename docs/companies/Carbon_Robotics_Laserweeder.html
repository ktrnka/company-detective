        <h1>About Carbon Robotics</h1>
<p>Carbon Robotics is a technology company founded on January 1, 2018, that focuses on revolutionizing agricultural practices through AI-powered robotics. The company is headquartered in Seattle, WA, with manufacturing facilities in Detroit, MI. As of December 2022, Carbon Robotics employed approximately 81 people <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/maka-autonomous-robots">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Products and Services</h2>
<p>Carbon Robotics specializes in developing innovative solutions for weed management, particularly through its flagship product, the LaserWeeder™. This product utilizes computer vision and AI deep learning to identify and eliminate weeds with high-powered lasers, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy. The LaserWeeder is capable of killing up to 300,000 weeds per hour and operates 24/7, significantly reducing labor costs and increasing crop yield and quality by protecting soil health and eliminating the need for chemical herbicides <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/autonomous-weeder">(Carbon Robotics, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the LaserWeeder, Carbon Robotics offers LaserThinning, a complementary technology that automates the thinning of crops, preserving desired plants while eliminating unwanted ones <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com">(Carbon Robotics, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Business Model and Customers</h2>
<p>Carbon Robotics operates in the B2B sector, serving a diverse range of agricultural customers, including Hungenberg Produce Co., Kerr Farms, Triangle Farms, Duncan Family Farms, and Grimmway Farms <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com">(Carbon Robotics, 2024)</a>. The company generates revenue by selling its robotic solutions to these large-scale commercial farms, which benefit from reduced labor costs and increased efficiency.</p>
<h2>Financial Overview</h2>
<p>Carbon Robotics has raised a total of $255 million in funding across multiple rounds, with the latest being a $70 million Series D round in October 2024, led by BOND and NVentures, Nvidia's venture capital arm <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/company/maka-autonomous-robotic-systems">(CB Insights, 2024)</a>.
