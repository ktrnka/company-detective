        <h2>Sentiment Towards Carbon Robotics</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This seems like an absolute game changer if the whole tractor/laser setup costs less than $500k." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjx1sz/">(Giblet_, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Neutral Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I think it should have been first, frankly: a lot of farmers/ranchers are REALLY ready to stick it RIGHT TO Deere/Catepillar, et al with the heinous 'right to repair' problem." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k33coaj/">(QuietlyGardening, Reddit, 2023-10-03)</a></li>
<li>"I don’t think people understand how expensive regular farm equipment is already, and how much money goes into fertilizer and other chemicals on top of that." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqj07h3/">(ShadowController, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This technology will kill this technology. That unit probably costs way more than a sprayer, and the energy bill it creates is undoubtedly gargantuan." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqjmcbq/">(ironfist221, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>

<li>"This is LaserWeeder from Carbon Robotics. It uses AI technology to detect weeds and kill them with lasers." <a href="https://carbonrobotics.com/">(GrabWorking3045, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Concerns About Effectiveness</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I work in this field and one issue I haven’t seen brought up in the comments so far is that the technology is far, far slower than typical herbicide spray applications." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqj0zra/">(Visual_Mission1223, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
<li>"Cost is another major factor. Spray rig + chems vs this cannot even be close in costs." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqj7llg/">(Enigmatic_Starfish, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Concerns About Cost and Practicality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It could be. After the initial cost and the price of the fuel for the inevitable generator, it's lower maintenance than a sprayer." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqinpsi/">(w1987g, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>

<h2>General Sentiment on Agricultural Technology</h2>
<h3>Skepticism Towards Electric Tractors</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Tractors are a terrible application for EV tech unless we're talking about small auxiliary tractors not used for full field work." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/k31atjy/">(btone911, Reddit, 2023-10-01)</a></li>
<li>"Nope it has been stated that ev tractors are not good for soil due to weight and short battery life." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16x76a9/electric_tractors_are_coming_to_clean_up/lppnlyq/">(Resident-Donkey-6808, Reddit, 2024-09-30)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed Feelings on Future Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This is how it starts buddy then wham! Humans are batteries and these machines hover over us eliminating the 'weeds'." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/14pkhnw/eliminating_weeds_with_precision_lasers_this/jqihcog/">(Phillipinsocal, Reddit, 2023-07-03)</a></li>
