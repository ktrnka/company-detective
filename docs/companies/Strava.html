<h2>Privacy and API Changes</h2>

These changes limit how third-party applications can access and display user data, including prohibiting the use of Strava data in AI model training <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">(Strava, DCRainmaker, Nov 19, 2024)</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Technical Issues and Customer Service</h3>
<ul>

      <p>They acquired fat maps and absolutely butchered it. Absolutely shocking work from strava. No snow feature any more on maps and not user friendly. I hope they fix it, I know me and all my snow season friends are looking for another app to use. Would give it less than 1 star if I could</p>

      <h4>Why Did You Buy and Delete Fatmaps?, 1 stars (hockeyboybrad, Apple App Store, 2024-12-29)</h4>
      <p>Fatmaps was an unbelievable app that provided invaluable resources to backcountry skiers, hikers, campers etc. 

Strava comes in and buys the app and "integrates" it with Strava. This means all of it's useful features were deleted and Fatmaps is basically gone. The main consequences are twofold

1) Putting backcountry users at higher risk of injury and/or death with no reliable map guiding information and having to rely on paper maps.

2) Making life harder and less fun for those who plan backcountry excursions. Fatmaps provided exceptional mapping and descriptions of routes - to relieve the stress of route planning for outdoor recreationists. 

Strava clearly saw Fatmaps as a "superior potential competitor" in the next few years if Fatmaps decided to add in features that Strava currently offers. Easiest way to ensure this doesn't happen...buy the app and shut it down. Strava needs to look deeply in the mirror and figure out how they want to be perceived.</p>

      <h4>Expensive dating app full of stalkers!, 1 stars (Lovegirl05431, Apple App Store, 2024-09-15)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using Strava for over 10 years. It used to be great to follow friends and challenge segments. Now the app only is a money making gimic and full of cheaters and stalkers. The price for the app is outrageous and they’ve removed almost every single feature from the free version. I paid for the full app for several years but just cancelled my subscription. 

Almost all my local segments are created or owned by cheaters. There’s someone who claims they ran a 3 min mile near my house. I’ve reported it several times. Nothing is done and I’m not the only one who complains. Look at any group of segments and you’ll find hundreds of fake or false records. Strava does nothing to fix, verify or remove them. 

In the last year or so they made it so you HAVE to make your profile public to do segments but all that does is let people stalk you and DM you. I’ve had several stalkers locate me on other social media because they found me on Strava. I can’t record segments in a private profile. This is highly dangerous in my opinion. 

Strava only cares about making money. If you want actual data and analytics, use Garmin. Strava has turned into an expensive dating app for stalkers.</p>

      <h4>Was once really a good app, very annoying now, 2 stars (secretlettuce, Apple App Store, 2024-12-07)</h4>
      <p>At one point I was a big Strava fan but their product changes lately induce increasing frustration and seem designed to force “engagement” - for example the incessant prompt to name my workouts that was rolled out recently pisses me off.  The weird AI integration recaps what I already knew about my workout and makes me feel as though I have no sense of what’s going on with my body.  I can’t stand reading the recaps. 

Strava also messed up with the Fatmap integration.  They purchased a useful product and destroyed the features that made it so. Fatmap standalone app was easy to load, pan and zoom, find slope angles, and study routes planned or travelled.  Strava seems to be struggling with 3D basics.

Maybe this is all intentional and Strava is redesigning itself to alienate a segment of users like myself.  After 6+ years as a loyal user I’m looking for Strava alternatives (my Garmin app combined with OnX backcountry seems like a good combo) - I find the app increasingly cumbersome, commodified and useless. Not sure why I would pay annually for it collect my data, when I get superior fitness tracking features with Garmin.</p>

      <p>i’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.

That said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. 

The other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. 

Note all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me</p>

I'm guessing Strava is trying to be the one-stop shop for everything, but they do not replicate tie-ins that are helpful. In my case, TrainerRoad integration will have to stop. Why hurt other companies and cause collateral damage to all of your users? This is going to make me start looking for a replacement to Strava.</p>

      <p>As of right now, I can’t stand this app. I decided to cancel my subscription earlier today and now every turn I take inside the app is reminding me that I need to renew my subscription and it’s ruining the remaining 14 days. I’ve got on the thing I paid for. The lack of data on the information screen is laughable. I have no idea why you can’t see real time. Heart rate and/or elevation. The screen seems to constantly switch back between orienting to the north and then orienting towards the direction. You’re heading on the computer. There’s no way to lock out the screen. I find the social value of this app marginal and the idea of paying seven or eight dollars a month for what is really Peter pretty mediocre app. Makes no sense to me. I also annoyed by the fact that you have to turn on notifications for it to record heart monitor information using your Apple Watch. I’m sure this is just a tactic to try and make people more engaged with their. Absolute garbage in my opinion. I can’t wait to get a bike computer and get off this.</p>

      <p>This app used to be runners’ go to for everything running and cycling. But in the last year or so Strava feels like Facebook and that’s not a compliment. It’s focused on getting you to sign up for premium, connect you to people you don’t know, give and receive kudos and some other features that have no value to me. I’d say Strava has become more of a social media platform. They’re also regularly changing the privacy settings and trying to tenable cookies so they can sell your information. I understand a company needing to monetize their product. I’d pay $5/month to have privacy, not be bugged by their useless features and not be reminded of someone posting for the first time and all the other pathetic notifications they send. 

In the meantime, I stopped using Strava and just keep track of my training on garmin’s website. Can’t pull trigger on deleting it yet but very close.</p>

With premium there are annoying map pop ups and it only shows mile split times instead of average mile, removing one of the few useful features of the app. To cap it all off, this is uncustomizable and uncancelable until the 30 days is over.
