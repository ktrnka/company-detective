        <h1>About Strava</h1>
<p>Strava, Inc. is a prominent social fitness platform founded on January 1, 2009. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has grown to become a central hub for athletes worldwide, particularly those involved in running and cycling. As of 2023, Strava has over 100 million users, making it one of the most popular fitness apps globally <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)</a>. The company operates primarily in the B2C space, catering to a diverse audience of athletes ranging from casual exercisers to serious competitors. Strava generates revenue through premium subscriptions and partnerships with businesses that engage with the athletic community via challenges and sponsored segments.</p>
<p>Strava's primary product is its mobile and web application, which allows users to track their athletic activities, connect with friends, and participate in community challenges. The platform supports various sports, including running, cycling, hiking, and swimming, and offers features like GPS tracking, performance analytics, and social networking capabilities. Strava also provides a Developer API, enabling third-party developers to create applications that enhance the Strava experience <a href="https://developers.strava.com/">(Strava Developers, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $151 million in funding, with significant rounds including $110 million in November 2020 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava">(Crunchbase, 2024)</a>. While the exact number of employees is not publicly disclosed, estimates suggest a workforce of around 200-300 employees <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Details about Strava's leadership team are not extensively covered in the provided content. However, the company's CEO has been vocal about Strava's commitment to user privacy and data control, emphasizing the importance of maintaining user trust while navigating the complexities of data privacy and third-party integrations <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>API and Privacy Changes</h2>
<p>On November 19, 2024, Strava announced significant updates to its API agreement, restricting third-party applications from displaying Strava activity data to other users and limiting the use of Strava data in AI models and analytics. This move aims to enhance user privacy and control but has raised concerns among developers about the viability of their applications <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html">(DCRainmaker, 2024-11-19)</a>. Additionally, Strava has stopped sharing user data with third parties, a change that has sparked discussions within the community <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/strava-wont-share-data-and-doesnt-want-you-discussing-the-change/">(Matthew Sholtz, 2024-11-20)</a>.</p>
<h2>New Features and Developments</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Strava Art</strong>: This creative feature allows users to create artwork using GPS data from their activities. It has gained popularity, with users planning intricate routes to form recognizable shapes and designs <a href="https://stories.strava.com/nl/articles/how-hard-is-it-to-make-strava-art">(Strava Stories, 2024-10-04)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Coach and Insights</strong>: Strava has introduced an AI-powered feature that provides instant insights into workout data. This feature, known as Athlete Intelligence, is currently available in beta and has received attention for its unique and sometimes humorous comments <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/11/strava-app-artificial-intelligence-fitness-athletic-memes/">(Leo Schwartz, 2024-10-11)</a>; <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/strava-s-powerful-ai-insights-are-here-athlete-intelligence-is-now-available-in-beta">(Stephen Warwick, 2024-10-03)</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Edit Feature</strong>: Launched in September 2024, this feature allows users to seamlessly personalize their activities immediately after syncing them, giving users more control over what they share <a href="https://www.t3.com/active/youre-sharing-your-workouts-all-wrong-stravas-quick-edit-can-fix-that">(Matt Kollat, 2024-09-25)</a>; <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/new-strava-update-bringing-quick-edit-activities/">(Karandeep Singh Oberoi, 2024-09-25)</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>User Feedback</h2>
<p>Recent changes to the activity feed, which now prioritize activities from followed athletes over the user's own activities, have led to confusion and frustration among users who prefer a chronological view of their workouts <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859">(Strava Community Hub, 2024-11-18)</a>. Additionally, the API changes have sparked significant backlash from developers and users who feel that these restrictions may limit the app's functionality and integration with other services (Intervals.icu, 2024-11-16).</p>
<h2>Partnerships and Integrations</h2>
<p>Strava continues to expand its ecosystem through partnerships with various fitness and health applications. Notably, the integration with Jefit has been highlighted, although users have experienced some syncing issues <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/developers-api-7/partner-integration-with-jefit-1966">(Strava Community Hub, 2024-11-18)</a>.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Strava remains a dominant player in the fitness app market, with a robust user base and innovative features like Strava Art. However, recent changes to its API and user feedback indicate a need for the company to balance privacy concerns with the functionality that users and developers expect. As Strava continues to evolve, its ability to maintain user trust while fostering a vibrant ecosystem of third-party applications will be crucial for its long-term success.</p>

Also, can you take away the annoying "pay for pro" banners stuck all over the screen??? I know I can pay for a subscription if I have a lot of money to burn, you don't have to remind me every single ride.</p>

      <p>Love the functionality but utterly disappointed by how extremely restricted the free version is now compared to when I first started using the app 10+ years ago. There used to be a really great range of free features - really simple and practical things, including for example, viewing your full history on a given segment, or creating a route - which I now find to be premium features (after a few years off the app). I think it's a money-grubbing disgrace and I'm now considering alternatives.</p>

      <p>Recent quick edit feature makes me want to stop using Strava. It just makes it so much inconvenient to use because the edits I want to make are in the advanced edit which means I have to either wait 5 seconds for the quick edit to appear and then go to advanced edit or get disrupted as I try to edit by the quick edit feature. Either make a turn on/off for quick edit or make it customisable to change what's on the quick edit page. I know its smth small but it's just so frustrating each time.</p>

Add winter pictures, aspect overlays, slope angle all the beautiful features fatmaps offered. This app looks way too busy also.

Please allow me to customize this. And why are cycling activities not grouped? "Gravel ride" is 6 scrolls from "ride" - Even when when set to latest activities, feed is not in order. This is basic database SQL. How hard can it be?</p>

      <p>A recent update seems to have broken indoor runs. It doesn’t record my pace correctly so the run distance is screwed up or the app stops recording. Outdoor runs still seem fine though.

I thought maybe it was the watch but I just did an indoor run on the Apple Fitness app and when it imported to Strava, it was fine! So yeah, something broke recently. Please fix it!</p>

      <p>I upgraded to annual subscription and was charged $79.99 and they continued to charge $11.99 per month for the next 4 months. Strava didn’t acknowledge my payment towards the annual subscription and when I asked for a refund from Apple for my double payments they said it is against their policy to refund anything beyond 60 days so I lost the money I spend towards the annual subscription fee and was still charged the monthly fee on top of that. I can’t reach out to Strava because they don’t have customer service for billing. Moral of the story is to avoid Strava subscription at all costs. Not worth it and you risk being double charged with no chance of refund. Also can’t be charged back with the bank without compromising your Apple ID. Meanwhile features keep being dropped while the price continues to go up for less services and support.</p>

      <p>I push Strava data to multiple other apps. It’s the only centralized data hub out there that currently allows 3rd party apps to utilize my data for other features that Strava will never develop on their own. I do not subscribe to Strava as I don’t care about leader boards, analytics, routing, etc. So I have a “free” account. But for that “free” account, I give Strava FREE access to MY data for their purposes, like heat maps, routes, etc. for the benefit of their paying customers. With their latest announcement, Strava is now limiting what third party apps can do with my Strava data using “privacy concerns” as their reasoning, even though we ALL have agreed to share the data through their platform. It’s as if they want to kill off any and all other apps’ business models. I am currently searching for a Strava-less process to fulfill my needs and hope everyone else, including app developers, are doing the same.</p>

      <h4>Almost 5 stars but Apple Watch Integration seems like an afterthought, 4 stars (Puzzle0227, Apple App Store, 2024-09-14)</h4>
      <p>i’ve been using this app for sometime now. In general, I really really like the app. It’s relatively easy to use and I’m happy that it’s able to get your heart rate from the Apple Watch.

That said it’s missing two key features. The first feature is the fact that you cannot, use the Apple Watch and the iPhone together at the same time. The reason I find this important is even though I may look on my Apple Watch most of the time while I’m hiking or any other activity and my phone is away, there are times when I’m hiking that I would like to see the map with the track I’m following and progress on the map itself. The only way to make this possible if you only use your phone without the watch at all. Even if you start your track on your phone, you cannot view the current status on the watch. i’m not saying to put the map on the Apple Watch as that would be quite difficult to navigate but in times you get lost and you want to see where you are on the map that’s impossible if you start it from the Apple Watch. Note, This is much different than syncing the Apple Watch and the iphone app. That sync has been seamless, but that sync can only occur after the fact which doesn’t help if your off the track and want to get back on the track. 

The other aspect of the Apple Watch that is missing is the fact that you cannot rearrange the stats as you viewing them. I like seeing my mileage and it seems to be the smallest thing on the screen, and you have no way to edit the data view screen on the  watch. Slight inconvenience but if you need glasses to read, I would want to put the things that are important in larger text and up toward top. 

Note all that said the app is excellent and works as designed. If it had the features above, it would be a clear five star app for me</p>

      <p>One might think capturing data would be the most important feature of Strava that their engineers absolutely would not let break. You’d be wrong.

Don’t hit the save button before the UI has had a chance to crunch the data it’s been receiving in background and display it on screen. If you do, you’ll lose it. Not even the elapsed time was correct.

CalTopo (you know, for navigation) is the only other app I used during the activity and without any complicated layers or route data (literally one) so being evicted from memory is unlikely.</p>

      <h4>Excellent functionality, too much locked behind paid subscription., 3 stars (Darthch3ddar, Apple App Store, 2024-07-28)</h4>
      <p>I’ve loved using Strava for many years, but I’m getting frustrated with the volume of things that are being locked behind paywalls, so much so that I’m considering switching to my Garmin app entirely. 80 bucks a year is a terrible deal for folks who already get better statistics from the apps that come with their watches/fitness devices, and isn’t a justified cost for small enhancements.

For example, joining group challenges isn’t free beyond 3 challenges accepted, which I didn’t know until I tried to join one this week and was forced to pay or just not be able to participate.</p>

      <p>Been using Strava for years and what started as a fun app to be social has turned into a joke of a fitness app. Segments were the best part and of course now are behind a paywall. Even if you do pay, the analytics are nowhere near as good as Garmin connect or intervals icu. But now Strava will start to limit you and restrict your ability push YOUR data to third parties because apparently they own whatever you put on their server.

It seems that the FatMap app no longer functions, and Strava hasn’t incorporated its key features. “Ski” isn’t even an activity option. The nice maps, including aspect, gradient, and comments on the trail are absent. Customer support didn’t provide meaningful assistance.
