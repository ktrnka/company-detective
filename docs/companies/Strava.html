        <h1>About Strava</h1>
<p>Strava, founded on January 1, 2009, is a prominent digital platform that connects athletes worldwide, allowing them to record, share, and analyze their fitness activities. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has grown to become the world's largest fitness community, with over 125 million athletes across more than 190 countries <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a> <a href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands">(Strava, Press Release, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>Strava primarily operates in the B2C space, offering a range of services and subscription plans to individual users. These services include activity tracking, club creation, sponsored challenges, and event organization. The platform supports various sports, such as running, cycling, and swimming, and integrates with numerous devices and wearables. Strava also offers a Family Plan and a Student Plan to cater to different user needs <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/">(Strava Company Overview)</a>.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue through subscription plans and partnerships with brands that sponsor challenges and events on the platform. Strava's partnerships, such as the one with Chipotle, aim to engage users in activities while promoting healthy lifestyles <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/chipotle-strava-global-new-years-fitness-goals/736446/">(Jessica Deyo, Marketing Dive, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Strava's distribution is primarily digital, with users accessing the platform via mobile apps and the website. The company has raised a total of $151 million in funding, with the most recent round of $110 million occurring on November 17, 2020 <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strava">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, Strava has evolved by integrating new technologies, such as AI, to enhance user experience and maintain its competitive edge. The company has also faced challenges, including user dissatisfaction with recent acquisitions and privacy concerns <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742">(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72">(Sylvie Corbet, AP News, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h1>Key Personnel</h1>
<p>Michael Martin is the CEO of Strava. He has emphasized the company's commitment to enhancing user experience through community feedback and technological advancements. Martin has been vocal about Strava's vision of connecting the world through movement and the company's focus on delivering value to its global user base <a href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands">(Strava, Press Release, 2023)</a>.</p>
<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Product Developments and AI Integration</h2>
<p>In 2023, Strava announced a focus on accelerated product development and AI integration at its annual event, Camp Strava. New features include AI-enabled Leaderboard Integrity, a Family Plan subscription, and a Dark Mode for the app <a href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-unveils-new-chapter-of-accelerated-product-development-at-brands">(Strava, Press Release, 2023)</a>.</p>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<p>Strava has partnered with Chipotle to create customized route segments and challenges, expanding their collaboration globally. This partnership aims to engage users in friendly competition while promoting healthy eating habits <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/chipotle-strava-global-new-years-fitness-goals/736446/">(Jessica Deyo, Marketing Dive, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2025, Strava announced a collaboration with Apple Fitness+, integrating their services to motivate and reach more active people. This integration is part of a broader effort to enhance user engagement and expand Strava's reach <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strava-and-apple-fitness-collaborate-to-motivate-and-reach-more-active-people-in-the-new-year-302336274.html">(STRAVA, 2025-01-03)</a>.</p>
<h2>User Feedback and Community Sentiment</h2>
<p>Strava's acquisition of Fatmap has led to user frustration due to the lack of integrated features for backcountry skiing and winter sports. Privacy concerns have also been raised following an investigation by Le Monde, which revealed that high-profile individuals' movements could be tracked through the app <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/updates-on-fatmap-integration-7742">(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-macron-bodyguards-security-strava-0a48afca09c7aa74d703e72833dcaf72">(Sylvie Corbet, AP News, 2024)</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, changes to the activity feed have been met with mixed reactions, with some users finding the new layout confusing and less user-friendly <a href="https://communityhub.strava.com/general-chat-2/activities-missing-in-feed-3859">(Community Hub, Strava, 2024)</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Strava remains a dominant player in the fitness tracking space, with a strong community and innovative features. However, the company faces challenges related to user satisfaction, particularly concerning recent acquisitions and platform changes. Addressing these concerns and enhancing product offerings will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge and fostering community loyalty.</p>

      <p>The free app seemed OK, but I jumped too fast into a family subscription, only to find the integrations are not compatible with any of our devices. While it took a little time, at least Strava's support reverted me back to free and refunded my money in full. I'll be uninstalling it, but I'll move this review from 1 star to 3 stars for that...</p>

It should have how weather affects your performance. This app is just data analysis, so analyze the data and give it to us. Garmin app is free.

      <p>Please please please change the pictures back to the way it was before, it's now sooooo annoying! New Strava UI is terrible. They forgot the first thing about designing user interfaces, and that is the number of clicks or swipes to complete a task is directly related to how annoying it is. It now takes 2 extra clicks per image to update the caption (doubling the effort), and 2 extra clicks per image to view the caption (compared to the zero before)!!! I used to like captioning all my images!!</p>

      <p>I’ve been using this app, and honestly, it’s always had issues. But now? It’s completely broken. My run won’t post—map won’t load, no stats, nothing. I run a club and post the same day I run. Now I can’t. What am I supposed to do, delay it? No. I pay for this app, and it keeps failing. If this is Instagram’s fault, fix your cross-posting. I need this fixed NOW. If you need proof, email me. This is unacceptable.</p>

      <p>Hi guys, love Strava & have used this app for over a decade but there is 2 super annoying things that I'd love to see fixed. 1. The widget doesn't refresh for days (even after a workout), also I don't think it needs the start workout button as it covers part of the widget. 2. On the watch app the 'end' workout button is massive & it's very easy to accidentally touch it which is super annoying. Thank you.</p>

      <p>It's good see paths and tracks folk have taken but I find the app very clunky and not very user friendly. Especially when it comes to actually searching for trails. You know they exist but strava doesn't highlight them. There is a few issues with making your own too. I'll use another app for making tracks and trails and only use strava for recording my data I think.</p>

      <p>I love Strava! They offer trails close to your area as well all over. You're able to add friends, join/create clubs, complete challenges all while tracking your activities (whether it's hiking, biking, running, walking, skiing, swimming, rock climbing, weight/strength training, and so many others they offer). It's pretty much a social media that tracks your activities and offers recommendations, and it's not just for athletes, it's for anyone who is active or trying to be more active. 🏋️‍♀️🏃‍♀</p>

      <p>Decent and great for keeping track of walks and activities. Unfortunately the GPS signal can sometimes be shotty, The devs should implement a system that will try to fix areas where it forgot to record, such as when point 1 loses gps signal and point 2 regains signal instead of instantly connecting the dots and ruining the data just predict via the walk speed and distances on the map where they probably went, or let them adjust it slightly. The app sometimes loses miles worth of data, rarely.</p>

      <p>It's best of it's kind, but can be much better. Hopefully the support will get attention. 1. Too many activities that are obviously made in vehicle - cases when a user forgets to stop recording after a ride and suddenly rides at 100km/h. This should be automatically flagged, instead strava expect to users to flag other people's activities and limits flagging to only 10 activities a day. PLEASE FLAG AUTOMATICALLY AND MAKE A CLEANUP OF EXISITING ACTIVITIES!! !! Allow addition of URLs!</p>

      <p>Update 1/29/25
The flyover feature is a pretty useless perk. Would rather have all the maps that Strava brought over from Fatmap used for downloadable offline maps and route building, much how Fatmap operated. 

AI feedback is also pointless as just a summary of what you did. 

Winter 3D map needs to be able to manually orient since it will often tilt the activity out of view. 

Still would like to see the items listed below from my original review. 

Enjoy using the app, but considering the price everybody is paying for premium, I feel like the app can get some increased functions. For example, the “Fitness and Freshness” is only available on the website. Seems like that can be developed into an app-friendly format. 

Also, it would be nice to have equipment options for all sports. For example, having the option for different surfboards/skis/snowboards to choose from. Plenty of people have multiple sets of equipment for all of these sports.

Does Strava actually read reviews to see what the customers actually want or don’t want?</p>

I feel compelled to write this review as it’s very frustrating to be asked to UPGRADE on almost every screen in the app, seeing it over and over.

I’ve always liked Strava over the years and the gradual updates it’s made over time, and used the paid subscription for enhanced features while training more seriously for a short period.

If the app is no longer sustainable for the amount of free vs paid subscribers then just charge for the app already and quit being so aggressive demanding users upgrade. I noticed most of my old friends/followers hardly seem to use the app now, removing part of the fun when I was more active before. I might be forced to find another app and leave Strava behind too.</p>

      <p>This app succeeded in disappointing an iPhone user.  Certain reference sources indicated its metrics were integrated with Apple Health (AH).  Experience suggested otherwise.
- A pain to set up, understand, verify integration with AH.
- An over abundance of measures for the less experienced user/athlete.  Assumes much prior knowledge.
- Poor integration with AH app.  Missing key measures and drill down details for a workout imported to AH.  More of a stand alone app.
- Poor or absent display of key data like heart rate recovery.  Like VO2 Max (fitness measure), within the Strava app or as synced to AH.
- Too much ‘social’ content.  This app seems designed for ‘exercizers’ wanting virtual connection to a broader community; a legitimate feature for those seeking this, but non-starting for the solitary athlete just doing their thing.  
- Again, not a substitute for or supplying alternate measures of fitness in place of those built in to AH.

      <p>I loved Strava until the recent app updates no longer support my Apple Watch 3. Why prevent years-long users from continuing to use your app? Based on my reading, this is not a change forced by Apple but rather a decision made by app developers at Strava. 

If anyone from Strava reads these, please restore use of earlier versions of Apple Watch. I shouldn’t need to upgrade a perfectly functional watch just to use your app.</p>

      <p>The app is pretty annoying to use haha. The automatic pop ups after activities is a bad feature choice. Pop ups in general are annoying. I wish they would let the user select this feature if they like. Also, adding gear is such a pain. To select a brand of shoes, for example, you have to scroll all the way down a giant list of brands. Why can’t there be a search bar? Cool app, but some of these feature designs lack common sense.</p>

      <p>I pay for premium. That's a lot. Today was the SECOND time in a few weeks where my hike didn't actually record. So I'm upset and going out of my way to give a review.

For as big of a development budget this company has, for as much money they collect, this is unacceptable. Normally I wouldn't rank 1 star, but in this repeat situation, and with the expectations set at such a high price point, I suggest the company, respectfully, go pound sand.

I’ve got on the thing I paid for. The lack of data on the information screen is laughable. I have no idea why you can’t see real time. Heart rate and/or elevation. The screen seems to constantly switch back between orienting to the north and then orienting towards the direction. You’re heading on the computer. There’s no way to lock out the screen. I find the social value of this app marginal and the idea of paying seven or eight dollars a month for what is really Peter pretty mediocre app. Makes no sense to me. I also annoyed by the fact that you have to turn on notifications for it to record heart monitor information using your Apple Watch. I’m sure this is just a tactic to try and make people more engaged with their. Absolute garbage in my opinion. I can’t wait to get a bike computer and get off this.</p>

      <p>Liked this app perfectly well, used for a few weeks, and then I got locked into a 30 Premium Preview. 

Somehow, they managed to make the paid version of the app worse than the free version! 
With premium there are annoying map pop ups and it only shows mile split times instead of average mile, removing one of the few useful features of the app. To cap it all off, this is uncustomizable and uncancelable until the 30 days is over. 

Completely disappointed in the app and will no longer be using it. Hope this is fixed soon.</p>
