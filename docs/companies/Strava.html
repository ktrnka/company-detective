<li>"Strava is king. For the social part, Strava is also the best one by far." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jagvfuh/">(igoramadas, Reddit, 2023-03-01)</a></li>
<li>"I personally use Strava just for recording my rides to share with likeminded riders/runners...and don't really have any interest in any of the other features." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jah25yd/">(Home_Assistantt, Reddit, 2023-03-01)</a></li>
<li>"Strava for me it's only a social platform." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jagy0sn/">(guidotrueb, Reddit, 2023-03-01)</a></li>

<h3>User Experience and Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The interface is just turning me off. I tried to use it just because it connects with my dog’s collar. But man…. It’s just too 2010’s ikea vibe." <a href="https://apple/12389620857">(WangShu-SZ, Apple App Store, 2025-03-06)</a></li>
<li>"The community aspect of the app is nice. But it is weirdly under-featured on basic fitness app elements." <a href="https://apple/11998331978">(Userbotss, Apple App Store, 2024-11-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Subscription and Pricing Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This app used to be great until they locked every single feature behind a paywall. I can no longer recommend it for anybody, there are much better options out there." <a href="https://apple/12346864482">(Benny&amp;, Apple App Store, 2025-02-23)</a></li>
<li>"I have been paying premium to support Strava. For this I got treated like an idiot. Well, I cancelled my premium subscription." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/11eyn9p/ive_seen_a_lot_of_people_like_me_frustrated_at/jajrv9n/">(aitorbk, Reddit, 2023-03-01)</a></li>
<li>"Strava did a bait and switch. They built their app on our data, our segments and instead of adding features, REMOVED features." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1hg1egy/best_free_alternative_to_strava/m2ihdvz/">(Mountainking7, Reddit, 2024-12-17)</a></li>

      <p>Route creation needs a manual mode in the app version. Attempting to create routes for local trails is impossible because the app consistly wants to " snap" to a path that does not exist. It doesn't even follow the heat map everyone is taking. Based on Google posts this is an issue strava continues to neglect.</p>

      <p>seems to track distance and mileage and at the highest level it tells me I had 8 best efforts on my ride. but if I drill into segments none of them show best efforts. as I drill into "Today" I don't even show up at all but I would have been #1, #2, #3 for many on the ride today. weird, glitchy. this app was so much better and had so much promise 7-10 years ago.

      <p>I have been on Strava for over a decade and having tried other similar Apps, I would rate it as the best. That said, it is quite disconcerting that quite a few features which werecearlier available to non-paying members have, over time, been withdrawn, and are available only if one subscribes. Strava ought to reconsider this issue, as a bulk of its members are amateur athletes and not professionals, and if is perhaps the former who contributed to the immense popularity of Strava.</p>

Somehow, they managed to make the paid version of the app worse than the free version! 
With premium there are annoying map pop ups and it only shows mile split times instead of average mile, removing one of the few useful features of the app. To cap it all off, this is uncustomizable and uncancelable until the 30 days is over. 

Completely disappointed in the app and will no longer be using it. Hope this is fixed soon.</p>

I’ve got on the thing I paid for. The lack of data on the information screen is laughable. I have no idea why you can’t see real time. Heart rate and/or elevation. The screen seems to constantly switch back between orienting to the north and then orienting towards the direction. You’re heading on the computer. There’s no way to lock out the screen. I find the social value of this app marginal and the idea of paying seven or eight dollars a month for what is really Peter pretty mediocre app. Makes no sense to me. I also annoyed by the fact that you have to turn on notifications for it to record heart monitor information using your Apple Watch. I’m sure this is just a tactic to try and make people more engaged with their. Absolute garbage in my opinion. I can’t wait to get a bike computer and get off this.</p>

And why can’t the feed be sorted by recency? That would be the most basic thing to add, so it’s a deliberate choice to subject people to “the algorithm”. And the paid subscription doesn’t turn off the spam. The website is less spammy and has more relevant analysis on workouts but it’s so ridiculously slow and hasn’t improved in 5 years. Do you not employ engineers?

I submitted a ticket and was informed that I would no longer be able to use my watch with the app because they would no longer support earlier generations of Apple Watches. But I could use the phone app and manually upload the activities. Lol, seriously? Like I’m gonna be training with my phone and then waste a bit more of my time uploading. I also haven’t been able to reach Apple Support on this because. Extremely disappointing and frustrating.</p>

      <h4>No way to disable useless features, 1 stars (James Sumners, Apple App Store, 2025-01-20)</h4>
      <p>They are trying their best to make this app too annoying to use. They added a useless “Athlete Intelligence” feature no one asked for and there’s no way to turn it off. They added a SUPER annoying pop up when you open the app after recording a ride with a bike computer. This pop up has a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT user interaction than the regular activity editor and it just ticks me off every time I try to use it. Of course, there’s no way to turn it off. So now it’s more steps to get to the editor you want than it was before they added this terrible feature. And now they’ve gone and moved the manual post/activity button off the home page. It took a long time to find where they hid it, and it makes zero sense why it has been moved. Oh and for this social network, you can’t be social and share links to articles, videos, or anything else you might like to share with your community. Strava is actively trying to lose subscribers.</p>
