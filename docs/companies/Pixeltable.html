        <h1>About Pixeltable</h1>
<p>Pixeltable is a startup based in San Francisco, founded on January 1, 2024, by industry veterans Marcel Kornacker, Pierre Brunelle, and Aaron Siegel. The company focuses on developing open-source AI data infrastructure designed to simplify the complexities of multimodal AI applications. Pixeltable's platform offers a unified data management solution that supports various data types, including video, images, audio, and text, through a consistent table API <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/corca-research">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
<p>Pixeltable's primary product is its open-source AI data infrastructure, which features a declarative interface, automatic incremental updates, lineage tracking, and user-defined functions. These features aim to reduce infrastructure code and compute waste, enabling faster deployment of production AI applications <a href="https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/">(Pixeltable, 2023)</a>.</p>
<p>The company operates in a B2B model, targeting sectors such as computer vision and generative AI. Notable early adopters include Obvio and Variata, who have reported significant improvements in infrastructure efficiency and cost reduction <a href="https://pixeltable.com/blog/pixeltable-launches-ai-data-infrastructure-providing-a-declarative-incremental-approach-for-multimodal-workloads-transforming-how-teams-build-ai-applications/">(Pixeltable, 2023)</a>.</p>
