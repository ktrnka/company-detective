        <h1>About Lamini</h1>
<p>Lamini is a Palo Alto-based startup founded on August 31, 2022, by Sharon Zhou and Greg Diamos. The company specializes in developing a platform that enables enterprises to deploy generative AI applications effectively. Lamini has raised a total of $25 million in funding, with notable investors including Andrew Ng, Andrej Karpathy, and executives from Dropbox and Figma <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/dropbox-figma-ceos-back-lamini-a-startup-building-a-generative-ai-platform-for-enterprises/">(Wiggers, TechCrunch, 2024-05-02)</a>. The company's mission is to provide tailored solutions for enterprises, addressing the challenges they face in adopting generative AI technology <a href="https://workhub.ai/lamini-a-startup-transforming-enterprises-with-its-generative-ai-platform/">(Anees, Workhub, 2024-05-10)</a>.</p>
<p>Lamini offers an Enterprise LLM Platform that provides tools for building and deploying mini-agents with high accuracy. Key features include Memory Tuning, Memory RAG, and a Classifier Agent Toolkit (CAT). The platform supports various deployment options, including on-demand, reserved, and self-managed models. Lamini caters to a diverse clientele, including developers, startups, and enterprise teams, and emphasizes user-friendly integration with existing tech stacks.</p>
<p>The company has a rich history in the field of large language models (LLMs), with a team that has been involved in training, fine-tuning, and preference-tuning LLMs for over two decades. They have contributed significantly to core LLM research and have deployed LLMs in production to over 1 billion users. Lamini's team has also educated nearly a quarter million students on fine-tuning LLMs and mentored tech leads who developed major foundation models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama 3.1, Google’s PaLM, and NVIDIA’s Megatron.</p>
