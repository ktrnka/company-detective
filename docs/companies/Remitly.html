Often receive the money within hours! I don’t know why anyone would go with any other service. Hands down the best option!</p>

      <p>Tried this app for the first time and it did not work for me. Sending money to family in a different country and there was a hold up for some reason. The customer service rep was unhelpful on explaining why the transfer didn’t go through. I wasted 4 days waiting on the transfer to process and ended up not getting through. I could have tried something else in that time due to urgent need. Overall it was a bad experience for me.</p>

      <p>I used to send money to my family in Mexico via Western Union, but there would always be the inconvenience of going to the currency exchange office and wait in line to be helped, sometimes they would make a mistake with the name recipient and I would have to go back to fix it and in the meantime my family would not get the money. With Remitly all I have to do is grab my phone choose the family member I want to send money to and done. It only takes me 1 min to do it. Just that simple. I'm so happy I discover Remitly. ❤️</p>

      <p>This is a solid product to send money to your family and loved ones in the Philippines, I’ve been using it for years. I’ve even used it to send myself money when I was visiting the country as their flat rates they charge for the conversions are actually better then other ways I’ve converted USD to php.

      <p>So they recently just suspended my account for absolutely no reason and I tried calling can’s emailing the customer service about it and they could not even give me an explanation or anything as to why my account was suspended and I have been on remitly for almost 2 years now so I really did not understand that and I hope everyone else has a better experience than I did with these guys because I honestly was not expecting that after being a loyal customer with them for so long so I hope everyone else has a better experience than I did and maybe even let me know if the same thing might have happened to them recently</p>
