      <h4>Disappointing, 2 stars (IamScarlet68, Apple App Store, 2025-03-04)</h4>
      <p>The app works fine. If anything, the customer service is very poor. Some transactions are reviewed which is understandable, but they promise a review of within 24 hours. I have waited for a transaction of mine to go through after being reviewed (which was weird because it was petty cash compared to my other transactions). They said 24 hours, but mine took 3 days. On the 2nd day, customer service to wait for another 24 hours. 3rd day came, I reach them again only to be told, “well, nobody has reviewed your transaction” and all they can do is make a report. Nothing to escalate the transfer properly. How is that the consumer’s fault? 

Also, I’ve noticed their exchange rates before was better than other apps. But now, no more. As of today, they are 55php per dollar while other apps are 57-58php per dollar with same transaction fee.</p>
