      <p>The service is very efficient and convenient at the same time. The customer support agent was very knowledgeable and easy to communicate with. She made me aware of all of the important policies and procedures I needed to know about in regards to my currency transfer. Most importantly though, I felt like the customer support agent cared about my transfer like it was her own! I'd definitely recommend using Remitly's services to anyone needing to make global currency transfers as Remitly has definitely become something I'm grateful to be able to count on and use in a beneficial way!</p>

      <h4>Very Disappointed, 1 stars (Ashley-Marie Weston, Apple App Store, 2024-12-09)</h4>
      <p>I started using this app abroad months ago. It was so useful. I was able to use to pay vendors for my business while abroad with accurate currency conversions.

I had not used the app for a few wks and I logged in. It didn’t allow me to sign in and informed me that my account had been suspended. 

I contacted support and was told I violated their terms for usage and they would never reinstate my account. I have NOTHING but send money or receive money on this account from clients or vendors for my business. I wasn’t able to receive any help going forward to see how my account was compromised. 

I would HIGHLY recommend keeping a back up app that works like this if you’re abroad bc having this happen in the middle of a contract, has been a NIGHTMARE. Without resolve.</p>

      <p>Last month Apple Pay worked just fine through the mobile app. Today I tried sending money and tapping the Apple Pay button did nothing. It’s like the button was broken. I ended up going to the website and it didn’t even have the option for Apple Pay. Just Bank Account and Debit/Credit card. Lastly, the website said there is no fee for using a debit card, but I was charged $1.99 transfer fee.</p>

      <h4>Nobody cares, 1 stars (The stupid people, Apple App Store, 2024-12-13)</h4>
      <p>Hi,
Nobody cares at Remitly especially the people who can’t speak English at customer services. I have used this service for years sending money to family in the Philippines, I have done all they required sending a copy of my ID banking information.Recently I was treated Very disrespectfully for what reason??? None was given other than my service was terminated due to not following the rules. If sending money to pay bills buying food for the family, Christmas presents was against the terms of use it wasn’t on the list.
   My account was closed . upon calling to resolve this unfortunate situation they was Rude stating I broke the rules, account closed, I can never have another account. I read the rules I hadn’t broke no rules.There  was no middle ground nothing I said mattered just fell on def ears and I was told again I broke the rules ??? This was absolutely absurd.. I never broke the rules I sent money to family for food bills every week to only one person then all a sudden ACCOUNT CLOSED for no good reason not even a good reason cause none was given just you broke the rules good bye that’s it and a RUDE good bye at best..
    I see they try to write a retraction stating their willingness to help but to whom??? They always say our commitment to customer service is priority and stating the laws but it’s just a retraction.they just want people to read it thinking they want to help but they really don’t just trying to look good….CONFUSION FRUSTRATION…
     That’s no help …I think they should state a clear reason with proof and allow an explanation before they terminate you..by law …they site laws when they want your ID and banking information I-Paid the taxes on this money I worked for it I earned it how I spend it is my business stick to the plan Remitly you are a service that relays on customers if you run them off how will you stay in business???</p>

      <p>I I used to like the rates and fees. However, last few times I sent money they charged for deliveries. It used to be free as long as you use bank account. Even pick up from bank has charges now. It’s not good to add fees to those free services in the past. Your service should become better through time. Also, when I send bigger amounts they try to get more private information like SS# and birthdate. During those times, I go to XOOM.com for immediate services. You lose market when you do that, Remitly.

Also, the exchange rate is Veeeery low!</p>

      <p>I’m extremely disappointed with Remitly. My account, which I’ve been using for three years to send money to my own accounts, was suddenly suspended without any clear reason. I was told it was an automatic system action and that I’d get a response within 24-72 hours. It’s been over a week, and still no explanation. I also recommended Remitly to a friend, and her account was suspended after her first transaction. This is completely unacceptable, and I’m very dissatisfied with the service.</p>
