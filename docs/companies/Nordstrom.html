<h2>Going Private Proposal</h2>
<p>On September 4, 2024, the Nordstrom family, led by Erik and Peter Nordstrom, submitted a $3.76 billion proposal to take the company private, offering $23 per share for the remaining shares they do not already own. This is their second attempt, following a failed bid in 2017. The proposal is under review by a special committee of independent directors <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/">(Duckett et al., CBS News, 2024-09-04)</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>In Q2 2024, Nordstrom reported a 3.4% increase in net sales, reaching $3.8 billion. Digital sales accounted for 37% of total revenue, up from 36% the previous year. Nordstrom Rack stores showed strong performance with an 8.8% sales increase. However, net income decreased by nearly 11% to $122 million <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/">(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)</a>.</p>
<h2>Supply Chain Optimization</h2>
<p>Nordstrom has improved its supply chain operations, achieving a 5% increase in click-to-delivery speed and lower fulfillment costs. This led to the decision to halt plans for a new omnichannel center in the Pacific Northwest <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-cancels-west-coast-fulfillment-omnichannel-build-out/726193/">(Carranza, Retail Dive, 2024-09-09)</a>.</p>
<h2>Strategic Partnerships</h2>
<p>The Nordstrom family is partnering with El Puerto de Liverpool, a Mexico-based retailer with a 9.6% stake in Nordstrom, to finance the proposed buyout. Liverpool's resources and market presence are seen as strategic assets in this endeavor <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/">(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)</a>.</p>

      <p>I dont like it anymore. The company has some real sleazy policies on how it handles employee misconduct complaints and frequently delays mediations due to being unprepared etc. Not all the smoke and mirrors you see from the outside. Inside. Companies that lack proper management can injure alot of people.</p>

The ease of picking up at a convenient location in 1-2 days makes me very pleased and saves us all time.    I count on Nordstrom quality and service and nothing is lost by the use of online!   

Thanks Team Nordstrom's !</p>

      <p>Nordstrom fails when it comes to assisting you if you accidentally ship to an incorrect address!! 
They were unable to : 
1.) Cancel my order !!
2.) Change the wrong address to the correct address !!
3.) Allow me to call the shipping store directly to request shipping address correction
4.) Their Nordstrom App is exceedingly limited, it does not allow change of Default Address, any changes ( deleting addresses) to addresses in the App, App does not allow one to cancel their order, App does not allow one to change the shipping address, etc.

My order was placed, confirmation showing the incorrect address, less than 30 seconds I called Nordstrom to request shipping address correction. They stated that I / They were unable to cancel or correct the order in any way!!
Fail.
I had shipped to my mother’s home where I had just been visiting in error. My mother in her 80’s is not able to pack up ship back to me.

      <p>I’ve had the Nordstrom app long enough to go through their re-order of everything when they said their app was going to be better. It has never gotten better. As long as I’ve had this app, which has been as long as they’ve had an app, every single time I sign in, including with face recognition, it always makes me answer the security questions, even though I always click the box to remember me. So it never remembers me, makes me answer security question EVERY time, and it’s super frustrating. It has honestly made me use the app less because I’m really just so fed up with having to do this. And yes, I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and it still makes you do the same thing. I’ve been told by multiple Nordstrom employees that I shouldn’t have to do this and that it was going to change several years back when they were redoing their application platform. Obviously, that is not the case. What good is having facial recognition and a “remember me” sign-in procedure when you have to answer a security question every single time?</p>

      <h4>I don’t like being forced to use the app when I’m on the website, 2 stars (Shopissimo, Apple App Store, 2024-08-01)</h4>
      <p>I have had to delete the app on several occasions because the website keeps automatically launching the app.  There are functions I prefer on the website (via Safari on my ipad), so it is very annoying to suddenly be forced into the app in the middle of a transaction and not be able to complete it on the website. I’ve contacted Apple about trying to prevent this and they have not been able to get it to stop.

I love Nordstrom and a fan of their customer service, website, products and employees. I have been an Icon for six years, doing most of my shopping on line. But … for the app to launch when I’m trying to do something in the website is frustrating and I have literally closed out of everything (app and Nordstrom.com and made my purchase on another retailer’s site so I can be in control of navigation on my device. 

If this is something that can be fixed, please let me know.  Now I only have the app on my ipad when the website is having issues and delete the app altogether as soon as the website functionality returns. so I don’t have it launching constantly.</p>

      <p>Hello,

I love to dress but shopping is not  fun for me. I only shop at Nordstrom for my clothes and shoes. I would say the Anniversary sale is where most of my clothes and shoe shopping happen. Nordstrom’s website is great and very user friendly. I can sort which helps me shop faster. Your returns are easy too. Keep up the good work. I look forward to shopping at Nordstrom more in the future. I will say my wife is one of your best shoe shoppers.

First when I get in I asked one of the ladies if she can take me where the YSL department and she took me over. She was helpful but not familiar because is not  her department 100 percent I totally understand her. So she asked one of the sales person behind the YSL counter if she can help me out what I need . She came  over with a little attitude!!! Her response was telling her such whatever number for the product instead of looking and show me. In any event the person who took me over explaining to her that she is looking the product etc . She was not interested and showed more interest to sell. So I left unhappy!!! I never complained but I thought  customers  service need to improve. I love to shop but after today I will consider to cancel my credit card.</p>

      <p>I have been a Nordy girl for close to 40 years. I always enjoyed the shopping experience whether in person or online. Nordstrom took pride in having impeccable customer service and well-dressed customer representatives. But as of late, Nordstrom has spiraled downward. I was online viewing a dress, and when I viewed the video of one of the customer representatives from one of the Seattle stores, I was appalled at how she was dressed. She looked so unkept, and her dress was dirty (looked like two oil stains) at the bottom. This representation is not a good look for your company. Despite the “anything goes” philosophy society has seem to embrace, Nordstrom needs go against the grain and uphold some standards.</p>

      <p>Dianne at the Twelve Oaks store in Novi, Michigan is the best salesperson because she provides individualized service. She remembers her customers: greeting them with warmth and kindness. She goes above and beyond by researching products for her customers, and letting them know the results of her search. She is very knowledgeable, honest, friendly, and hardworking. These are attributes that I have not experienced at this store or your Somerset location in many of your employees. For the first time on my shopping experiences, I make it a point to purchase and return items with her. If Nordstrom’s would like to continue to be known for outstanding customer service, I would suggest someone like Dianne mentor your new and existing employees. Also, I would suggest sticking more items in your stores and have sales personal visible and easy to find, especially in your women’s departments. Thank you</p>

I also love to use it when I’m in a hurry, and I can see what is in stock at a specific store, and then pick up my order curbside. I absolutely love how you can see all your purchases/returns in the app… It helps me keep track of items I have purchased and the size , or when I want to share the item with a friend. I also use the app when checking my Nordstrom credit card statement as well. I wish every store app was this easy to use:).</p>

      <p>On 7/22/2024 I went to the Fashion Mall to purchase some new bras…I needed to be measured & fitted and hopefully find some perfectly fitted bras.
I also needed to return an online purchase.
Upon arrival in the lingerie dept, I was greeted by Debbie, an associate that asked if she could help me…she showed me to a fitting room, asked a few questions, took my measurements and told me she would return shortly.  I was happy to see her with a nice selection of beautiful bras, in a variety of colors.  
I tried a few on, the fit was great!  I was so happy!
Debbie saved the day…I told her how happy I was!
Not only did I find a new bra, but purchased 6!
I mention a I needed a few more items, she helped select a few pretty and cute items.
She did my return, rang up my new items and off I went…Thank You Debbie!  Debbie took her time to make sure I was pleased with my new items and my lingerie shopping experience was awesome!</p>

      <p>This app is fun, its quick, it's convenient and it knows exactly what I like.I cannot express how many times I've left my own retail store of 16 years, after serving countless customers all day, and I run straight to this app or directly to the Nordstrom store to decompress from my day and do my own bit of retail therapy. I kind of feel at this point but Nordstrom is really the only store I need to shop at - for myself and my whole entire family. I appreciate the added bonus of Nordstrom notes that come as a great surprise at checkout. Sometimes you forget you have them and it's like a little treat or a subliminal "thank you ". And to actually feel appreciated. I bring my daughter and my nieces, all teenage girls along with me just so they can acclimate themselves to shopping at a place that offers a great service to them consistently. It is important as a woman of color that this is taught at a very young age, unless they will not expect it. Thank you Nordstrom for always setting a high standard. and for taking care of us hard-working women who truly enjoy being pampered by you. Sincerely.</p>

      <p>Nordstrom is by far one of the best customer service and has customer centric policies. App is designed so strategically and keeping customers in mind. I loved the fact that today where most of the biggest store do not help customers and gives  hard time in resolving customer issues, Nordstrom policies like lifetime return policy, Price match adjustments makes it one of my best go to store. It’s so hassle free and customer centric to shop from. I love the app for adding recommendations based on events and activities. Also the sale is genuine and in store associates are also pretty helpful and nice with you.</p>

      <h4>What happened to customer service?, 1 stars (Msgisnotforme, Apple App Store, 2024-07-13)</h4>
      <p>I left two dresses with a seamstress in the Peabody, Mass. location. Received them today and found on the first dress that one sleeve was altered in the front but the second was mistakenly altered in the back. On the second dress, I cannot determine whether any alteration was done since it is still so ill fitting. Called cust svc and my first call I was left on hold. Second call, a baby was screaming in the background and the rep put me on hold where I remained until I hung up. He eventually called back and told me I needed to call the store. Why not say that before putting me on hold? I sent an email to customer service and the written response is barely understandable, a bunch of mismatched words. I am disappointed and surprised by this downturn in customer service. This is not the business it used to be. I brought the dresses back to the store to be fixed by a second seamstress, who charged an additional $96 to properly tailor the dresses and fix the poor work done by the first person. After reaching out to the store manager about the additional charge, she had the tailoring manager call me. That person was the first seamstress. She insulted me and tried to body shame me. What a horrible experience. In the end, she said that “just this one time” she would ask that the store manager void the second charge. This was not a courtesy for me, it was a way to cover for her shoddy work. I’m done paying high prices for poor service. Farewell Nordstrom.</p>

      <p>Anniversary sale used to be fun to shop, but it seems too many items are sold out before “access” is “granted”.  Nordstrom has become elitist as opposed to a quality store.  Apparently unless you spend thousands of dollars a year you are not a valued customer.  Will only buy from Nordstrom if it is the only place to get the item I want.  I have been a Nordstrom customer since the early 1980’s and have never been so disappointed trying to shop this sale.</p>

I can log in on the web on my mac and on the web on my iPhone without issue but when i try the iPhone app it wont work. And this happening right before the nordstrom sale is really frustrating.</p>

Additionally, it outlines your “status” level by telling you which level you’ve achieved rather than showing you with a chart etc. Especially since Nordstrom’s outlines each status with a dollar amount for Ambassador, Icon etc. It’s much easier to quantify your status on Shopbop or Net a Porter…step it up Nordstrom!</p>

      <p>Unfortunately I had a bad customer service experience for store return at Washington Square mall in Portland Oregon, which makes me feel the reluctance in the future. This is the first time I had the bad experience and basically cashier folks at 3 stores refused the return operation in spite that your policy says any cashier can process any returns.  2 stores processed the returns separate items as I said something but it is unnecessary argument that I had to make. None of them were not even in process of helping other customers. I have to admit that Nordstrom service is not what used to be any longer, which is extremely sad as I always enjoyed shopping experience at Nordstrom. Hope the employees training will fix the issue in the future.</p>

      <p>The Nordstrom app has a flaw that can be inconvenient. If you order a gift and have it mailed directly to a person. That person becomes the default address, unless you delete their address. There is a button to change the default to the most recent address. It automatically defaults to the most recent address without touching the default button. Once an order is in process, customer service cannot change the address or cancel the order. Otherwise the app works well.</p>

      <p>I was so disappointed when I went into the purse department this past Sunday. I have been eyeing a purse on line and decided to purchase it in store. The purse I wanted was available and I was ready to purchase it. The young boy that was in the department said nothing to us. I walked over to him and smiled, again he ignored us. I had to stand in front of him and say hello. To my amazement he just looked at me like he was deciding if he should speak to me. Of course at this point I knew I would not be purchasing anything from him. I turned to my husband and we left. Very disappointing experience in the department.</p>

      <p>Michael Kridel has always been my go to guy when shopping for my husband and son.  He has excellent knowledge of the brands and styles in his department and is always spot on with his recommendations on how clothes fit.  He remembers my name when I come to the store and is always friendly and helpful.  

A few weeks ago, Michael went above and beyond as a Nordstrom employee.  I had the unfortunate experience of getting a flat tire as I entered off of the highway, making it to the Nordstrom parking lot.  I thought I’d see if Michael was there to help me with my situation, and was so grateful to see his smiling face when I walked in the door.  He immediately called a tow truck service, using his personal connections.  Michael told me to do my shopping and he would call me when the tow truck arrived.  In addition, he gave me several recommendations on where I could get a new tire locally, as I live in Waterloo, IL and did not want to drive that far on a spare tire.  Michael was such a blessing to me that  day and I wanted to make sure Nordstrom knows what a gem they have in Michael Kridel.  Thank you!</p>

      <p>Free expedited shipping flaw
 Unable cancel an order

Shipping Address 
I sent a gift to a friend. Now it defaults to that same address I did not change my account’s shipping address.  I should have at least been prompted after that order. Especially that it differs from the my home address which on file.  

No where on your interface is there a place for me to correct it so that this does not happen again. 

Sending out into cyberspace and pretty certain nothing will come of this.

      <p>Previously I loved the app. I could order things from Nordstrom and retufn them if there was a sizing issue no problem. But then one day when i needed to make a return the App did not have an AE option in the state drop down menu.  I went online to make the same return and again there was no AE option.  I couldn’t even use the old standby of using the NY for state as it errored out. Its quite frustrating as a Nordstrom customer. I hope by addressing this here it can be solved. Thank you.</p>

      <p>First 3 colleagues skipped me I was stand by register waiting, then one gentleman was walking out from stockroom and other 2 persons just saw me. After 5 minutes finally a girl Shanel came over and asked if I needed help. I explained I needed to return 2 pair of boots, I understand you have to ask if something is wrong, I told her calf or is too wide and regular fits me tight. Then she requested you have you receipt, when you bought your shoes, I answered last Days of April, and then she said from this year? That is kind of rude. If you have a return in sellable condition and even with the boxes and packages of shipping, it doesn’t look like have years . I bought them on April 27 and returned them before a month, I asked her if you change the return policy . Her tones are rude and her face was unfriendly. I always buy my shoes at Nordstrom,but my experience this time is not the best</p>

      <h4>YOU CAN’T WRITE PRODUCT REVIEWS, 2 stars (dboy Tilapi, Apple App Store, 2024-04-27)</h4>
      <p>I’ve been using this app for a while now and so far it was going well. As I purchased more items from the app over the course of the time I’ve been using it, some of the items were just a disappointment when I received them, other times the courier which Nordstrom uses to deliver my orders wouldn’t drop my packages outside my house (if I’m not home). But the main reason for my dissatisfaction is the issue of customer product review. I don’t know if Nordstrom is intentionally preventing me or thier other customers from writing product reviews for their orders but for some reason, I just can’t seem to leave a product review for most of the products I’ve received lately. I feel like Nordstrom has intentionally blocked me from writing a review after I left a poor review for a product I received a while ago. Since then I haven’t been able to write previews for my purchases which to me I find it extremely bad tactic by the company. People to be able to write and leave a product review that they’ve purchased so other potential buyers can get a sense of what they re about to spend their money on. This is such a coward tactics by Nordstrom. No wonder I never see reviews on many, many items I’ve come across on the app that should have a lot of reviews. SMH</p>

      <h4>Review, 1 stars (50 LA, Apple App Store, 2024-04-23)</h4>
      <p>The customer services in the make up department is Excellent. All of your clothing department employees won’t ask you if you need any help if you aren’t dressed to impress. It’s disappointing because I am very fortunate and chose not to impress others by how I carry myself (dress). For that reason I don’t shop your clothing department anymore. I go to Macy’s to purchase my clothes.  Their customer service in all departments is excellent. I spend money where I’m treated good not looked down on as a Hispanic whos browsing so the employees think.</p>

      <p>I appreciate the ease of the app and the detail provided about the clothing.  The filtering works to narrow down your search as opposed to other sites where companies pay to have their product in an unrelated filter or show up multiple times in the same filter.  I also appreciate the stylist videos, particularly today when I am wanting to find lightweight pants online.  Watching someone move and describe the fabric was very useful.</p>

      <h4>QR code not working in app, 1 stars (BashaShop, Apple App Store, 2024-04-18)</h4>
      <p>Installed the app and linked my credit card to the payment portion. Have used the app to pay for purchases in store for about nine months. Very easy. A QR code comes up and they scan it and I’m on my way. The last two times I tried to use, the app in store to pay for items the QR code did not work.
I’ve called customer service and they transferred me three times and nobody seems to understand how the app works nor do they know how to fix this problem. Not sure why this is the case because the app has been around for a long time. I’m disappointed in Nordstrom, if they are going to have an app, their customer service needs to know how to address and fix problems.</p>

      <h4>Misleading pickup time and bad customer service, 1 stars (K4R3N69, Apple App Store, 2024-04-16)</h4>
      <p>Usually love Nordstrom and don’t have issues. However I made an order today through the app which stated that it would be ready for pickup the same day. I needed to pick it up today as I’m leaving for a trip tomorrow and only placed the order so that I’d have the items for the trip.

I waited for as long as I could but the order was “preparing for pickup” all evening. I showed up at the pick up desk with 10 minutes to close to see if I could get it. The customer service representative was on a personal call for about five minutes and then said it’s not ready and they’re closed. 

I don’t want to show up that late and make someone stay but hey - I was told it would be ready before close and I gave them as much time as possible to prepare the order. 

Apart from the in person desk being rude to me for being there close to the end of their day, the online customer support was also unsympathetic. 

Basically, I did not get the service I was promised, wasted my time going to downtown Seattle, and will have to take extra time off work tomorrow (if I can) to pick up the order. 

Very disappointed and annoyed with the situation as I only made the purchase because I was under the assumption that I would be able to pick it up tonight. 

I hate to be one to complain about customer service workers. But as someone who has had many similar jobs, I know it’s not difficult to put in a little effort and at the very least be apologetic about a crummy situation.</p>

      <h4>Selecting the shipping method is very unclear, 4 stars (Lbdoug, Apple App Store, 2024-04-16)</h4>
      <p>I selected a pickup at a store for an order to avoid it being stolen because I may already be on vacation when it arrives. However, only one item in the order is going for pickup and one is being sent to my home. Why would I want to send half of an order to my home and half for pickup? It’s a flaw in the system i. my opinion. Apparently one needs to make the shipping selection one item at a time and it’s not clear when I’m shipping. The system should at least ask if I want to apply my chosen method to the entire order. Like many people I’m accustomed to the way Amazon works and there the choice is for the entire order and that makes sense to me.</p>
