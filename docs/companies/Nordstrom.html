        <h2>Positive Sentiment Towards Nordstrom</h2>
<h3>Shopping Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Nordstrom has the best shopping experience in my opinion...the web and app experience are both top notch and you cannot beat the Nordstrom semi-annual sales." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzfnmw0/">(kj_jayhawk, Reddit, 2021-05-25)</a></li>

<li>"They offer a free personal shopping experience...the only thing you pay is what you end up buying." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzfnmw0/">(kj_jayhawk, Reddit, 2021-05-25)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Sales and Discounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The sale is absolutely insane. I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off <em>everything</em> is really a ridiculous steal." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fv9x49j/">(what-a-surprise, Reddit, 2020-06-18)</a></li>
<li>"I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvalj92/">(mdnla, Reddit, 2020-06-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I got a cashmere sweater for $5 and some silk shorts for $15." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/xaf1bb/make_sure_to_visit_your_local_nordstrom_rack_this/invkyx7/">(Geobead, Reddit, 2022-09-10)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment Towards Nordstrom</h2>
<h3>Product Quality Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I feel like they are all crap now. They seem to just sell cheap, poorly made clothes, rather than last seasons designer clothing at a discount." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/18s9xmm/best_nordstrom_rack_in_la/kf7el57/">(None, Reddit, 2023-12-28)</a></li>
<li>"Nordstrom Rack definitely produces goods specifically for this store which bear the same expensive brand names but are of a lesser quality." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyr3g93/">(eyr3g93, Reddit, 2019-09-01)</a></li>
<li>"I have two pairs of Joe’s jeans, both from NR, and they both pilled after a few wears and stretch out within hours to the point they look awful." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5oaj80/">(victoria_a, Reddit, 2019-10-29)</a></li>

<ul>
<li>"I went to the one in Mississauga last week. I waited in line for 45mins and another 45 mins to check out." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvckvaw/">(humanknead, Reddit, 2020-06-19)</a></li>
<li>"Honestly wouldn’t go to the Glendale one. In the past few weeks I went there and purchased quite a bit. Each time I paid and left only to find out they didn’t put everything in my bag." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/18s9xmm/best_nordstrom_rack_in_la/kf67zj8/">(SMH2180, Reddit, 2023-12-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Negative Sentiment Towards Nordstrom</h2>
<h3>Product Quality and Value</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I honestly find Nordstrom Rack to be full of overpriced garbage, even if it's 'Clearance.'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/bi5acq/discount_clothing_store_gotos_marshalls_nordstrom/ely81va/">(TheBattler, Reddit, 2019-04-28)</a></li>
<li>"If you, like me, equate the name 'Nordstrom' with high-quality, luxury brands... that is no longer the case." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/">(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison to Other Retailers</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Never assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom. It's well known that TJ Maxx and other 'outlet' type places will stock items from prestige brands but often those items were made SPECIFICALLY to go to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and are made far more cheaply than items that are carried at actual Nordstrom." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/">(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)</a></li>
<li>"Nordstrom Rack you really have to hunt. I’ve gotten a few good finds like polarized persol sunglasses for $80, Briggs and Riley luggage at over 50% off..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/bi5acq/discount_clothing_store_gotos_marshalls_nordstrom/elye02g/">(jeffthedunker, Reddit, 2019-04-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nordstrom Rack Specific Comments</h2>
<h3>Shopping Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"One of the two Nordstrom Racks near me has a 'single shoe' try on area. If you want the mate, you have to go to this counter in the back called 'Shoe Finder' or something and get the mate." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/c146bn/do_you_ever_feel_like_you_are_getting_punked_at/eramczu/">(Chazzyphant, Reddit, 2019-06-16)</a></li>
<li>"I love NR but there’s definitely a craft to shopping there to make sure you’re getting the best out of it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5lq5cg/">(ohmood, Reddit, 2019-10-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Those stores are completely different companies from the 'parent' store, for anyone who doesn't know." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrcj8y/">(Simco_, Reddit, 2019-09-01)</a></li>
<li>"I thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance... I now realize that that was not a valid argument." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15cll9/">(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)</a></li>
