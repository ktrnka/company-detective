      <h4>1 stars (Raffi Ananditya, Google Play Store, 2025-02-02)</h4>
      <p>nba 2k mobile used to be fun. now is just really frustrating to play. the loading screens are absurd, often taking 80 seconds just to enter events, tourneys, drills, etc. the gamepass feels like a ripoff, as overpowered cards become useless within days due to higher event cards constantly being released. on top of that, enemy npcs are ridiculously unfair, hitting impossible shots that ruin the gameplay, especially in king of the court events. save yourself the hassle and avoid this game.</p>

      <p>It's not about the app it's about 2k in it's entirety,. You guys make the game to hard to play, I'm a good ball player and cannot translate my style the game and it's because of the controls, and gameplay player movement.... I find it funny that geeks that can't shoot a ball in the real world dominate this junk,... Bring back NBA live or simplify gameplay to the point to where your basketball IQ and bag can be displayed</p>

      <p>Things you guys needed to improve 1. The game fouls is strange for me, two fouls, then free-throw how and why? 2. Why does every player have white shoes except crews. 3. Positions and starter selection: Why don't you guys give us mandatory to position players to the position that we want rather than natural position? 4. A part from Tourneys, we need a real league</p>
