        <h1>About 2K Games</h1>
<p>2K Games, founded in 2005, is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. The company is a prominent video game publisher known for its diverse portfolio, which includes sports, action, and strategy games. 2K Games operates across various platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices, and is home to several renowned development studios such as Firaxis Games, Visual Concepts, and Hangar 13 (2K, 2024).</p>
<p>2K Games generates revenue primarily through the sale of its video games, which are distributed both physically and digitally. The company caters to a broad audience, including casual gamers, sports enthusiasts, and fans of narrative-driven experiences.

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>Unionization Efforts</h2>
<p>In a significant move for labor rights in the gaming industry, workers at 2K's motion capture studio in California voted to unionize under the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE).

<h2>Removal of 2K Launcher</h2>
<p>2K Games has officially removed its proprietary launcher from all titles that previously required it, including popular games like BioShock and Civilization VI. This decision, which took effect on November 18, 2024, was met with positive feedback from the gaming community, as the launcher had been criticized for causing performance issues and unnecessary complications for players <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-just-beat-a-pc-gaming-villain-2k-removes-its-pointless-game-breaking-launcher-from-its-entire-catalogue/">(Wolens, PC Gamer, 2024)</a>.</p>

      <p>almost every time I do something like go for a block my players have a stupid spasm and do something super relevant like run out of bounds or they just have a mind of there own and do something I never wanted them to do. this resulted in loosing several different games.

It downloads all of the extra files just fine and will even display the opening screen for a moment and then it crashes. I have a moto g stylus 2023, I have plenty of memory and other games like call of duty, work just fine. i should have written this months ago but I really didn't think it would still be an issue. please help?</p>
