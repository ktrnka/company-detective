<h2>Concerns About Microtransactions and Monetization</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Criticism of 2K Games' Business Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>"What a ridiculously greedy move, it's no shock from 2K but I can't believe they're already shipping off titles so recent to their latest to force people to get the new one if they want the online experience." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/">(muzznation, Reddit, 2024-10-14)</a></li>

<li>"This is not exactly how massive game servers work... they just want to force everyone to the new game. I think it's very anti-consumer that they should down servers this fast." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1g38vmc/2k_games_lifespan_is_a_joke/lrv6z7j/">(starcrescendo, Reddit, 2024-10-14)</a></li>

      <p>Really annoying gameplay, players miss the easiest of shots sometimes then make difficult contested shots. Hard to play, I have to press the pass button 5 times just for a player to pass (leads to turnovers). Same thing happens with several of the buttons. Nice concept just executed horribly.</p>

      <p>This game will be deleted. It lags, your team can't play any defense, grab any rebounds, etc. You have wide open looks with shooters who have perfect 3 point shooting and they miss nine times out of ten. High risk, low rewards. They suck you in and make the gaming experience less fun the more you play it. Thank you for wasting my time.</p>
