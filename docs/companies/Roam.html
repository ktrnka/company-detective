</ul>
<h2>Mixed Sentiment about Roam (the Product)</h2>
<ul>
<li>"It's a shame that you need to be constantly connected (it's a 'mmo' (no real mmo feature, you just see other players)) but I had a blast on it. Lot of puzzles, lot of exploration." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/l30tvea/">(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-05-07)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay Insights and Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Playing roam is easy. Playing roam correctly is not." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuc3ez/">(lraeyx, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"This is correct. Roam is the hardest role to play correctly. Most under appreciated role, and the most necessary." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnztslu/">(PoastRotatoes, Reddit, 2024-09-20)</a></li>
<li>"A good roam makes jungling easier. A good jungle makes winning the game easier." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/">(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Yes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/">(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Great roamer dictate the flow of the game, but one single mistake from jungler can cost the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnum46u/">(Fanserker, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
<li>"Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/">(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategy and Role Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I typically try to secure the scuttlers (side crab real name) as mid, BUT as play with Ori most of the time i prefer not to roam until late game" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr2jelm/">(for3ignx, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Mids should always roam, help out jungler, help out in other lanes as best a possible. Often the mid lane player can make or break the game." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr4tkse/">(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"I find the opposite quite common lol. I'm Ziggs mid, the enemy Ahri roams without even pushing the wave, I spam-ping the toplaner multiple times, she even walks on a ward, but nothing, he dies anyway." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/">(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"Dude I swear I noticed the change too as a em/dia player all my kids stay in the lane instead of doing what the role is actually for which is essentially another jg. It’s crazy like so many leads could be given with a good tank or rotation." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr2g7e3/">(sagearts33, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
<li>"As a mid main i don’t mind jungle helping me shove lane so then we can rotate and make a play. I try my best to shove lane right before scuttle just in case i need to rotate to it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1n738/">(Loud-Rent-6847, Reddit, 2022-01-03)</a></li>
