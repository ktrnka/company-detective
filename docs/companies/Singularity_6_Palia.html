<h2>Workforce Reductions</h2>
<p>Despite the positive player reception, Singularity 6 has faced challenges, leading to significant layoffs in 2024.

The layoffs have been a significant point of concern, with reports indicating that the studio is struggling despite its acquisition <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palia-developer-singularity-6-laying-off-35-percent-of-workforce">(Game Developer, 2024-04-08)</a>; <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-laying-off-36-staff">(GamesIndustry.biz, 2024-05-17)</a>; <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/cozy-mmo-palia-seemingly-on-the-rocks-after-studio-goes-through-a-third-round-of-layoffs-this-time-affecting-40-of-staff/">(GamesRadar+, 2024-05-26)</a>.</p>
<h2>Technical Challenges and Innovations</h2>

<h2>Product Overview: Palia</h2>
<p>Palia is a free-to-play cozy online multiplayer community simulator that allows players to engage in various activities such as farming, crafting, homebuilding, and socializing within a vibrant, shared world. The game entered open beta in August 2023 and has since expanded to multiple platforms, including PC, Nintendo Switch, and Steam <a href="https://www.daybreakgames.com/news/dbg-s6-acquisition-announcement">(Daybreak Games, 2024-07-01)</a>.</p>
<p>As of June 2024, Palia has attracted over 4 million players, with more than 100,000 active daily users. The game has received a mixed rating on Steam, indicating a polarized reception among players <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palia-developer-singularity-6-laying-off-35-percent-of-workforce">(Game Developer, 2024-04-08)</a>; <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/palia-developer-singularity-6-is-now-part-of-the-daybreak-game-company/">(PC Gamer, 2024-07-02)</a>.

The game's unique blend of community engagement and life simulation has attracted a substantial player base, but ongoing challenges in operational stability and player satisfaction remain. The partnership with Daybreak Games may provide the necessary resources and expertise to enhance Palia's development and community growth in the future.

      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-03-08)</h4>
      <p>Initially I adored this game, it's easy to get in to, the story itself is fun, and there are so many adorable things to collect . The community was super friendly, and the core game-play has a little something for everyone (cooking, mining, fishing, npc friendships, ect).

However, at some point the people developing the game lost their passion for the project, sold it off, and now it has become nothing but a [i] lifeless money grab. [/i] The regular updates have continued, but every single update for the last year has been "Look at all these wonderful shiny things you can buy!" Bugs continue to go unfixed, to the point that entire areas of the map have become no-touch zones unless you want to randomly venture outside the realm of existence. The few free updates that have been released where centered around things that had already been in the game before, such as time-limited events being stripped bare and turned into monthly occurrences.

I gladly spent money on this game once upon a time to support it's development, but as the game continues to stagnate I can't help but wonder where, exactly, that money is going. $25 for a singular outfit is astronomical on it's own, but when you have thousands of players throwing $20-$50 into the game each month, and all you can bother to do is push out more cosmetics/decor, it becomes nothing more than insulting. 

If you're looking for something to occupy you for a weekend or a few days until you can buy a better game, this isn't a bad choice. It's still wonderful and fun to play with your friends. Just don't expect a story-line, as the mainline story is short, empty, and has gone untouched since it's release. Don't expect this to be a game you hang on to and enjoy for months or even years. Most of all, don't throw your money at it in support believing that they'll be able to use it to improve the core game, they abandoned that long ago.</p>

      <h4>Thumbs Up (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-27)</h4>
      <p>I'm going to complain, not because I hate the game but because I actually really like it. Making 'My Time at Portia' or 'Stardew Valley' into an MMORPG is a great idea and it's mostly well executed. However...

The game is needlessly grindy. It takes hundreds or even thousands of hours to do everything it has to offer. It's understandable because this is an MMO and they need to retain players, but I sometimes feel like my time as a player is not being respected. If you need a rare fish you might need hundreds or thousands of fishing attempts before you get it. If you want a plushie you'll be hunting for hours or days or weeks. Everything has a time mechanic, whether it be processing wood, ore, cloth, or farming. You want your crops to grow one stage? Better wait an hour. You want to process this ore? That's 10 minutes per bar. It's all gated behind a wait period. There is plenty to do while you wait, but it feels like an needless limitation to keep you hooked.

Speaking of needless, it seems like the game is needlessly designed in a way to create regret. You can easily spend your renown upgrading your plot instead of your focus. There's mistakes you can make doing quests that result in a "bad" outcome and one-time quest rewards that once consumed are gone forever, but actually can be used for decoration. The process of choosing a name is confusing and once chosen you're stuck with it forever. There's even a precious broken sign in front of your plot that once cut down can never come back, and people keep it as some kind of badge of honor. I'm not sure why the game is designed this way, there's not even a way to delete your character and make a new one without creating a new account. New players who don't have a friend to guide them or do a lot of research on the game will make these mistakes and regret them.

Then there's the in-game cash shop. I think it's mostly okay, in that the items are cosmetic and you don't really need to buy anything to play. However the prices are often a little high and when it comes to buying an outfit that looks good, a plot environment, a pet, and some tool skins you're looking at spending between $50-100 USD. It's possible to wait for sales and use the loyalty program to get a few things cheaper but as this is a social game and you want to look good in front of other people so a lot of players just end up shelling out way too much money.

Also the technical issues are annoying, we have deer floating in the air, randomly falling while climbing, getting locked talking to NPCs, chat not working, unable to leave quest-specific areas, etc... I've heard the game developer has had a lot of layoffs, and that the game is mostly abandoned and only has a skeleton crew, that's really disappointing. I want this game to ripen not die on the vine.

As a last mention, I wanted to talk about the "exploits". While most of these are fine (animation canceling is sort of a cool skill you can learn), the limitations to building your plot just seem completely unnecessary. Why not let people clip items or build outside their plot? It's not hurting anything and creates unique design opportunities and creativity. 

Overall Palia is really fun, it's just plagued with a few problems. I hope this review helps to catalyze the issues of other players and encourages the developers to do the work this game deserves.

If any new players are still interested in the game even after my complaints, use code f2942929-4f13-4147-ba10-613e55e19b62 when signing up for fruit bowl or something. My moral standing is lying down.

Note: I also wanted to point out that Steam Deck owners can play this game! It runs at 60 FPS and all online capabilities are functional right now. I used Proton Experimental but it might also work on the stable Proton.</p>

      <p>Palia launched in December 2023 with it's own launcher.
The studio behind Palia was acquired by Daybreak in 2024.
Nearly 40% of the staff were laid off. 

The majority of all updates (patches excluded) since they launched now were about getting you to spend your money in their shop, seriously they add new cosmetics for you to buy multiple times a month. The rest of the updates is about new ways to gather decoration and also bug fixes (The game is still extremly buggy it is also poorely optimized.)

There are OVER 120 premium outfits for you to buy. This does not include the diffrent colored versions that you can buy seperately. Almost every single outfit will cost you more than 15 Euro. The "fanciest" will cost over 30.
There are premium skins for your tools you can buy. (around 20 skins? some of them are weird because it's only for half of your tools?)
There are over 40 pets you can buy.
There are 8 landscapes for your house you can buy.
There are around 20 skins for your glider that you can buy.
You can buy emotes and reaction stickers.
One of their last "big" updates was a paid premium "club" where you need to log in every day in order to receive the highest possible amount of premium currency.

ALL of these things were added since they launched in 2023 but there still was no real story or lore update. They added ONE character who does not get to leave her room and does not walk around outside.
They are already recycling their ingame events. IF you want to call a timed window to buy or craft seasonal items an event.
I like the blackmarket they added but it's really just a place for you to grind a minigame if you want giant plushies (your chance for a plushie bag is 1,5%).

Considering they are now extremly understaffed I highly doubt this game will ever leave it's Beta state.</p>

      <p>This game is so awesome, all the best survivor-game things, but without fear to lose anything. You get resources, craft things, give presents, enjoy quests, build house of your dream, cook, go fishing and everything is even more fun and interesting with your team-mates. Community in this game is really nice, heart opened and kind, which makes it even more awesome. Thank you for everyone who helps with advises, cook with me and go on our hunts for treasures and magic creatures. Thank you to developers, for building such a sweet and cozy world full of so bright characters with their own stories</p>

      <p>So I will come back to this review at some point, as I do intend to keep playing... However, the thumbs down at this moment is hopefully to help folks get a slightly bigger picture of what I realized in 14 hours of game play.

This game dont get me wrong is good. The bones are here, and the storyline is definately got me excited!

However, I have come to learn that I have finished the story line as it has been written within ~5-8 hours. Im at a *wait for the story to continue*. I was like cool, ive caught up, when should I expect the story line to continue. Sadly, a quick Google search tells me that  been a work in progress for almost a year now, with little insight on when it will progress.

So this a friendly warning, This game is GOOD. However, dont join it yet. If you are like me and get sucked up into the storylines of games, the unfinished status, and little improvements are sure to drive you insane. I want to know what happens, I want to know why I exist! While I understand improving relationships with the Palian people are a must to a degree... the idea there is nothing to really shoot for at the moment is not a very big enticement. 

I hope they will improve the game soon with more storyline quests, and not turn out to be a game like Star Stable that has had 10+ years to finish a storyline, and still can't/wont.</p>

      <p>The game itself is alright, nothing amazing or truly groundbreaking. The minigames are more fun than the acc game cycle grind. The issue lies in the devs/publisher, they push out sub-par content mainly PREMIUM COSMETIC SKINS that'll cost an arm and a leg. Tool skins. Shitty powerpoint skins from the 2000s for £5-10, that crash the game and their response? "Dont use them". The release of "content" is so that the rightfully pissed off players have something to pacify them for another month.  Whilst never actually bug-fixing some of the largest bugs that have been around since day-dot. 

TLDR: Palia is meh, S6 are money hungry</p>

      <p>honestly it is a good stress free game. there is no player death, starving just means you don't get bonus exp, the characters you meet are all charming in their own way, majority of players are peaceful and helpful, players working together get more bonuses helping other players, there is little to no con for forgetting to check in on your farms for long periods, the mini games like chapa chasing are a great touch to break from the repetitive resource grinding, decorating your home is satisfying and easy to do,  the hunting is forgiving if your aim is lacking, and best of all ( IT IS FREE TO PLAY ).
There is no pay to win or getting an edge, the only things that cost money really are the cool cosmetics for your characters, gliders, and pets to make you stand out among your friends. 
The game is currently in beta and for what it is right now, I am hooked and find myself wanting to come to the world of palia to just relax and enjoy myself.  A home away from home.</p>

      <p>Sadly, despite I sunk 20 hours into this game I've to leave negative. Why? Reason is simple, game in the mid-endgame forces you to look for resources that you can't get just by playing. You need other player to help you and such resources are quite rare, so it's like hoping that someone else will find you nearby and help you with it. Another and main reason is how developers are "making this game" - only some decors, only some fixes and...

Update for premium shop. It's not how I would like to see this game in every update.</p>

      <p>I played this in Alpha. It had an amazing community with wonderful potential. Then they sold off the company to an abandonware unit who only pushes cash-grab updates while the main game is in a WORSE state than it was early Beta. 

This is nothing short of a buggy disappointing jester-fest. PLEASE can a worthwhile studio capitalise on the premise of this type of game! This game filled such a niche in the market!</p>

      <p>I've been playing this game for a few days and I've put almost 30 hours into it, so as per usual, it's time for a review.

!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!

**Things I like about Palia**
- There isn't really a time limit. Because it runs on IRL time for a lot of things, there are no seasons or specific slots of time where you could potentially miss something because you forgot to look at the clock. Stores are always open and NPCs are always available.
- The npcs have a lot of life to them. They have relationships with other characters outside of what the player experiences. They have pasts, they have presents, and they have aspirations for the future.
- The storyline is pretty good, if you're paying attention. You do have to put in the effort to read the hidden tablets and the engravings and whatnot to piece things together - you can also get dialogue from characters that elude to things that have happened. This game does NOT spoon feed you the lore - or anything, really.
- I personally appreciate the variety of romanceable characters. You have a couple that are older, you have a couple that are younger, you have varying ethnicities and you have a non-organic companion ( I hesitate to call him a robot, he is fully sentient and conscious ).
- The graphics are really pretty! It's stylized in a way that's charming without being cartoonish. 
- Choosing a body type in the character creation screen DOES NOT equate to gendered pronouns. I know this is nitpicky but I'm always frustrated when I have to pick between an accurate depiction of me, and being comfortable with what the npcs are calling me (I tend to create my character in my likeness, instead of creating a new character like some folks do - no shame either way!).

**Things I do NOT like about Palia**
- It. Takes. So. Long. To. Do. *Anything.* The game runs off of an irl 24 hour clock (as most mmos do). While in-game days are shorter (I think about 20 minutes or so), mechanics like smithing, wood cutting, smelting, etc. can take upwards of half an hour depending on what tools you have and what you're trying to make. You can only give npcs gifts once per IRL DAY. Romantic gifts are only allowed once per irl *WEEK*. Everything takes a LONG time. You really need to have both time on your hands and a lot of patience to get anywhere.
- The game is still technically in beta, despite being released, so I'm a little more forgiving about this, but there are a lot of grammar and spelling errors. Sometimes npcs repeat dialogue in a single interaction, sometimes they glitch through the floor, sometimes they just up and disappear for a few minutes and pop up on the other side of the map. There are a lot of minor, quality of life glitches like this throughout the game - however I have yet to find any glaring issues with gameplay and mechanics that would keep you from enjoying the game.
- Most of the cosmetics are locked behind a paywall - not a huge deal to me, because I don't really care for most extravagant outfits and fxs and whatnot, but if you're looking to really personalize your character, be prepared to spend some money. It's not *cheap* either, you could spend 20 bucks on a single outfit.
- Very few of the mechanics are explained. While most of them are simple (chop tree, cut wood, make chair) others are less intuitive (interact with npcs, get renown, find local shrine, commune with shrine, spend renown to gain xp bonuses "focus", eat food to keep focus, use focus to gain more xp to create more things to interact with more npcs, rinse, repeat). None of these are really explained, you have to hover over icons and text boxes to get more information, or stumble upon something and remember it for later. It's fine if you're used to the fetch-quest type games, but if you're new to this it can be frustrating.

**The low-down**
I, personally, would not recommend this game unless you are *really* into grinding. If you want to get anywhere in the game you're going to have to lose hours of your day just to get through a single lore quest. There isn't a whole lot to keep you occupied in the meantime.
If you're into that, go for it! If you'd rather shave your teeth on a chalkboard than spend an hour smelting stone bricks, maybe play Fields of Mistria instead.</p>

      <p>$30 USD to buy one outfit in a singular color is fucking insane. And then have that be the ONLY way to customize your avatar  with no possibility of buying customization items with in-game currency in an mmorpg had me uninstalling almost instantly. Honestly really disappointed with how insane the currency rates for this game were.</p>

      <p>Well, the good news is that Palia is a free-to-play game so I didn't have to spend any money on it to discover that it wasn’t for me. This game feels somewhat incomplete and like an uglier and slightly different version of World of Warcraft. I didn’t realize how much I wasn’t into the idea of another MMORPG until I tried this game out. I was slogging through the character conversations and dreading seeing yet another quest marker pop up and gathering materials.

There are long loading screens in this game even on a high-end PC, and they sometimes have wait lists with other players ahead of you, clearly a server limitation. I don't like having to sit there in silence waiting for things to load to get into another zone.

The UI is hit and miss. The grid-like placement, rotation, stacking and movement options for housing and furniture are great and intuitive. I wish other games had the same decoration and organization system as Palia.

The character creator was clunky. It’s missing a zoom-in (scroll in/scroll out) option, and I’d have to flip through tabs to get it to zoom in on my character’s face again. Somehow I pressed a button that undid my clothing choices multiple times and I was on edge with my clicks so that I wouldn’t mess things up again. Similar to Hogwarts Legacy, my character looked way prettier and sounded way better in the character creator. I look at her sometimes running around and I think that she is now ugly and her voice turned out very annoying. I don't know how these character creators are not translating accurately to the game itself.

When I came into this game as a new player, there were multiple times where quest markers on the map were unclear and NPCs were not located where they were supposed to be according to the quest notes. This led to a lot of frustration and running around and then giving up. Later, I saw there was some sort of a bug that kept NPCs from being where they should have been that was being patched. Not a great first impression. Sometimes quests are not marked on the map and sometimes they are, and I am not sure why.

There are no mounts in this game, but I kind of feel like there should be because there are large areas to run around. They would also make things look more interesting.

The premium cash shop has some pretty cosmetics and some really rough looking ones with ugly colors and ragged edges to the designs.

Things feel kind of empty in the starting zone. It's a bunch of brand new players mixed in with players covered in premium cash shop gear and pets. I don't really feel like it's a particularly beautiful land to be in.

Unfortunately, I don't find any of the NPCs that are romanceable to be appealing. They're all just purple people and one robot.

The thing that really soured me toward this game is that your dialogue choices impact what personality element is chosen for you later on, and at one point I misclicked a dialogue choice and wasn't able to see what I selected and there was no way to go back or to press undo, or to review what I had answered historically, etc. This mysteriously answered and missed conversation that I had with an NPC would not stop haunting me, and apparently if you ask support for your character to be reset, it causes you to lose all your referral rewards and purchased real world cosmetics on your character! So I was stuck with this feeling of messing up, tainting the game for me.

The fishing system is really impressive. It's well done and enjoyable, unlike some other games which make it really tedious. Bug catching was also cute and fun, with the idea of smoke bombing a bug to stun it and pick it up.

I enjoyed the soil tilling and plant watering mechanics. Walking around your soil patch with your tool and seeing it visibly make changes is very neat.

I didn't enjoy hunting with a bow and arrow. You chase a small sprinting target animal around trying to hit it multiple times while your arrows are wasted.

As someone who played World of Warcraft for years and then quit because it started feeling like a second job, I am not finding this MMO to be pleasurable enough to continue it. It's not as high quality and attractive as World of Warcraft, and I quit that game.</p>

      <p>Game is quite chill and peaceful, but the balance on values could be improved... e.g. Upgrading something takes thousands but selling each vegetable can only make 2-digit bucks and takes a few days.

Also the server is unstable, and I don't really like the cool down for teleport.</p>

      <p>I'm sorry, I can't get behind any game that forces fishing on it's players as part of the main quest.
There's not that much to do besides gather, farm and build/cook, the game is like a prettier version of minecraft minus the ability to kill other players.</p>

      <p>Palia is a really enjoyable life sim, cozy building game with some relatively okay social aspects, but since launch has continuously grown to become a money sink for cosmetics, and unfortunately hasn't done much in the way of improving gameplay since launch.

Every update since open beta launch has undoubtedly contained more updates to premium offerings than there has to the base game offerings. Pets, housing landscapes, skin tools, etc, are all locked behind money purchases, with none available (that I am aware of) in game. Granted I haven't played since middle of last year, but every time I come back to reach a patch, it seems like there's maybe one QOL update, and 5 premium shop additions, with the usual bug fixing. 

It's a free game, they have to make money, but at some point the game gets so stale and repetitive that you just zone out. Hell, there hasn't been any additional big open zones since the closed beta! There's many ways to improve upon the gameplay flow to make things more engaging and more exciting, but Palia has gone the route of premium purchases to keep the services afloat. Until they start balancing out giving some simpler rewards to regular players and letting premium players flare up with their shiny outfit, i'm probably going to leave this game on my backburner. 

tl;dr It's a free game and has some okay gameplay for 5 hours or so, then gets reptitive. The premium store is pretty aggressive on offerings and prices, and the development team seems to put more effort into updating the store offerings than the actual game.</p>

      <p>I've only spent a short amount of time with the game, while I love it, there's a lot of issues. The game client crashes and the connection to the servers drop off often. Graphics clip a lot with the world environment and  the characters. There doesn't seem to be a lot of content updates and reading through the page, it's primarily cash shop updates. 
There is a decent amount of players still online, but the game needs heavy improvement in terms of the above and I hope the developers realise the potential this game actually has. So don't be fooled by all the positive reviews.</p>

      <p>This game is the perfect blend of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Stardew Valley! The art style is playful and refreshing for those of us who have played many similar cozy games. All of the NPC's are well developed, unique personalities that are easily some of the most charismatic characters I've had the joy of playing beside!</p>

      <p>The main story line is expansive but gives you room to do what you like. It allows you to do things like farming, mining, plot improvements, fishes, and build relationships with npcs and other characters at your pace. The world is absolutely beautiful and calming. I've grown very fond of the game as a whole.</p>

      <p>A lot of fun for still being in beta. It's like Fate and Stardew Valley had a baby and this game was the result. So much love was put into every NPC and the world.

My only complaint is that I wish that this game had the capabilities to build your own clothing. A family member and I who play this game thought that a one time payment to make your own sets of clothes and sell them to other people rather than than the design team. I feel like they should stick to more of an oriental magical feel rather than Victorian. If they do Victorian, Magic Steampunk designs would work better.</p>

      <p>Very nice, calming game, if you like exploring and farming for materials in a world where the community is 99% helpful and friendly, where you can build your heart out playing with decorations that are not meant to be used in a certain way, but you do anyway, this is "the game" for you!
I started playing to look for an alternative for another game and it ended up being my main game :)
Still in development, there's a lot of bugs, not gonna lie, but none that kills the game play, usually they are visual ones.</p>

      <p>While the Game is Amazing, it lacks numerous BASIC features and alot of things just feel so poorly made, you can climb but sometimes you'll just lose half your stamina bar spazzing out on an UNBLOCKED LEDGE, you can't make another character, you also can't just LOG OUT AND SIGN IN TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT IN GAME. you sign in ONCE on the game first opening and THATS THE ONLY ACCOUNT YOU CAN USE ON STEAM, when your high tier tools are used they lose durability, the game doesn't tell you this but if your tool "Breaks" IT DEGRADES AND YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE MATERIALS TO UPGRADE IT AGAIN, and the game offers a "repair kit" that is AWFUL it gives 20 of them that using 20 of them doesn't even fix your gear HALFWAY, and things that SHOULDN'T HAVE DURABILITY DO, the "Bomb Bag" degrades, also alot of basic features are just not put in, no accessibility options, no seizure help, and there's 2 accessibility options currently, one does not work and the other is glitched and doesn't work, and when players complained about not being able to see at night they revamped the whole game's brightness instead of just ADDING A BRIGHTNESS SLIDER! just so many BASIC features in a game that either are VERY poorly made or just missing entirely,</p>

      <p>I am genuinely obsessed with this game and will never stop playing it as long as there are updates that keep it current and change things up like y'all do. It's a better version of Stardew Valley and it really satisfies my romance sim mixed with farming itch. I actually like not having a fighting element to it and hanging out with friends is awesome. I will not be a snitch for Subira though I am sorry.</p>

      <p>Oh boy, where to begin. First of all, I love parts of the game, but the further you get in the story, the more buggy it is. I've had to restart quests I've already done, received duplicate awards for something I did a long time ago, and don't get me started on the controls (I use a controller on PC). 

So, first thing I'll say is that at some point in the quests, the game becomes just straight grinding for a while. There's not much happening story-wise, and the things you have to gather for quests are sometimes ridiculous for rewards that are meh. My first weeks and days of playing, I WAS HOOKED. This game was my new hyperfixation, I thought about it at school, work and even in my dreams. It was fun, rewarding because there was constantly something new, and it was fun to just build my house and upgrade my things. But after a while, I would log on, and not have anything to do. I'd go chop some wood, mine some rocks or whatever, every single time. I think that if you play with friends, that's okay, you can still have fun with them. I LOVED exploring the new temples, finding every secret and chests. Oh, the chest. Why? Why can't you sell them? You have so many at the end, and they are too ugle to display, especially if you have 15 of the same sort. Sure, you can give them to Tish, but you have so many that it's stupid and you can't keep up with the one day gift rule. 

The game is fine, the world is charming, and the characters are mostly (looking at you Kenli) loveable. But mannn is it wasted when the game is so unpolished like it is. Bugs that force me to quit and restart the game, 12 year olds fighting over something stupid in chat, and it's clear that the devs are focusing more on the money side of things by releasing new skins and outfits. Sure, it's nice, and as a cosmetic fan usually i'm on board, but the game gets boring because there aren't that many events and story updates. 

Also, the control mapping IS HELLA STUPID! Why would you ever think that mapping the B button for the jump is alright? And the building system suuuuuuckkkssss. It counts your player collision as you move things in the overhead house menu, you have to place things individually for paths, and it's impossible to put stuff up on shelves or on top of dressers. Also, very sad that the pets are not really used. It's just for cosmetics. Would love to just pet my companion or something.

It seems like the game encourages exploration, but sometimes you do a hard parkour (eg the lighthouse) only to be rewarded with nothing. Nothing at all. You get blocked by invisible walls on a ledge that looks climbable and the vines are HELLA bugged and make you fall most of the time. Also, it's very difficult to notice what is gatherable or interactible. The big trees fool me all the time, because they look EXACTLY like the regular ones (eg the large heartwood trees), sometimes the decorative plants are more vibrant than the actual gatherable ones, and the stone and iron ores are not that different visually wise, especially in certain lighting.

I did not understand the community? What does it actually do? I haven't ever used it in the how many hours I've played this game. I thought Palia had a way for your friends and you to share a village and build it together, but it looks like that's not the case.

Overall: Did I enjoy this game? Yes. But as a game dev myself, it's clear this game needs A LOT more polishing, and the build mode is VERY rough. But as this game is still in Beta, I have to give them some slack. But as the game is still in this stage almost 2 years later, it is a bit worrying.

 If you are a casual gamer and only want a cute game with stardew valley esque mecanics and characters, go for it! If you are someone who wants to have a great time with friends, this game is for you! But just know that Palia is not perfect and has a bunch of flaws. If you are planning to beat the game, this is not for you.</p>

      <p>By my troth, Palia doth bring great joy to mine heart! A game of clever strategy and keen wit, where I, as lord, must tend to mine lands, rally my forces, and craft a kingdom fit for the annals of history. The art and design are fair, and the challenges most enthralling. Truly, it is a worthy pastime for any noble seeking a taste of power and glory. I commend it most heartily!

also its free! :D</p>

      <p>I don't write many game reviews, but I figured it was worth it for Palia.  I'm a 38 year old male.  Never thought I would be interested in any of these "cozy" games, but here I am, having a great time.  I always played mostly shooters, action adventure, or rpgs here and there.  I was exposed to Stardew for the first time a handful of months ago, and was surprised how much I enjoyed the laid back gameplay, while still enjoying a deep story and plenty of stuff to do.  A buddy of mine mentioned Palia and told me he got hooked on it, so I figured I would give it a shot.  I currently have around 25 hours into it after less than 2 weeks.  It's really nice having a game I can jump into after work to garden, gather materials, knock out a few quests, etc.  There's no pressure, no time limit, no health bar, no competition, no getting mad because some 12 year old sniped me from across the map.  It's just relaxing.  I also like that whether I jump on for 20 minutes or play for hours, I'm still progressing and doing something.  It really is a game you can play at your own pace without any pressure.  Currently, I'm in a party with my buddy that told me about it, my 36 year old brother, and my girlfriend.  All of us have been having a blast managing our plots and doing quests.  When more than one of us is online at the same time, it's fun to jump on discord to chat, gather materials, and help each other upgrade our skills.  I never would have thought that I would enjoy a game like this, but it really is a great way to relax after work, and meet with friends without any competition or stress involved.</p>

      <p>This game never gets boring. There is so much to do and find. Also, I love how you have to hunt, mine, fish, cook, catch bugs.... You're not just running around the map doing the same thing constantly. This best part of the game for me though, is building and decorating your house. It's a constant work in progress and so much fun. I definitely recommend this game.</p>

      <p>If you're looking for an action-packed thrill ride, this ain't the game for you. If you're looking for a no-danger cozy building sim, then you'll be right at home here. The game is completely free to play and although it does have cosmetic microtransactions, it never nags you to buy anything. Ever. The only thing even remotely close to that is a short "quest" to just look at the premium shop. So, with that stuff out of the way, let's talk about the ups and downs of this game.

First, the positives. Well, it's a UE game, so expect the visuals to be top-notch... and they are. This game is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is very lovely, the characters are well-made and well-animated. There are numerous concurrent storylines to invest in, and every character falls into a particular archetype or two. Naturally, there are romance options, and the game doesn't care if it's het or not. Tish and Jel in particular have wonderful romance paths. Tish in particular is involved with what is probably the most expansive skill in the game, which is Furniture Making. There's a dizzying array of stuff to craft to build your home, and the skill itself is little more than "collect stuff, make-stuff-animation". There's no complex steps to this skill, unlike Cooking... which I will get to later in this review. So once you have the materials, you can just build it in a few seconds on your workbench, then place it in your home. Object placement is very flexible, though it can be a bit glitchy at times. There are other skills to work on, such as Fishing, Bug-Catching, Hunting, and my personal favorite, Foraging. This involves both collecting plants and chopping trees. It's surprisingly relaxing. Farming is another skill worth investing in, and is probably the easiest to level quickly once you have enough soil plots. It's probably also the best way to make money. Once you're making a lot of star-quality produce, your finances will quickly become a non-issue. Another major positive of this game is the item request system. You can request of others to send you a particular item, and others can opt to fulfill the request. This is part of one quest in particular, and doing this a lot earns you Renown, which should be obvious as to what it is. Use Renown to boost your Focus bar, which increases the amount of experience you earn for each skill. Nom food to keep your Focus bar filled. Very solid mechanics there. Oh, and there's a kitty. Zeki is awesome. I swear he didn't force me to say that... but anyway, the last positive bit I will mention here, and it's a major one, is the sound design. The. Sound. Is. Incredible. This may even be a larger shining star than the visuals. The music is absolutely beautiful and is affected by location and time, with some tracks changing instrument sets in real time depending on where you are, such as in the town in Kilima. There's a base track that plays, and it will vary depending on which building you're in. That's such a great technique that not a lot of games utilize. BOTW did this in Hyrule Castle, and I thought it was perfect. Anyway, sound effects are also super important. The game does foley sounds correctly, and you can hone your hunting and bug-catching skills by remembering the various sounds of the critters you're after and keeping an ear out for them (or two ears, really). At no point does the music become intrusive; it's designed to be background music to enhance the cozy feel of the game. Just absolutely brilliant sound design all-around.

OK so... the negatives. Oh man, where do I even start. This game is plagued with problems. I cannot even get into the issues without acknowledging the Sugarfoot in the room, which is the completely broken coldet. This issue is so legendary that I think they keep it broken on purpose as to not disrupt people's expectations. Climbing cliffs in particular is so broken that I'm wondering how this even passed QA. Sure, blame it on the beta status, but it's been like this since the beginning with no sign of ever being addressed. Sometimes, parts of the scenery don't load properly, or colliders don't load properly, leading to all kinds of hilarious nonsense. I once found that I could walk completely through hills and even go totally underwater with no consequences. Sometimes you get trees that you can completely walk through, and although this hasn't happened since I started playing this version, sometimes chopping down trees with Muujin in them will launch you into the sky. That was the most hilarious nonsense ever. I've taken video of it when playing on the Switch version. These collective coldet issues can be a major problem on certain main story quests, where being able to navigate the environment swiftly and accurately are key to success. But anyway, other issues are minor, but some are more important than others. There's a MASSIVE amount of typos in the game. Misspelled words, incorrect punctuation, doubled words, you name it. It seems no one is on staff to proofread or even test. I found one bit in particular where the response option was the text that the character was supposed to say next, preceded by a scripting control code. What a hilarious screwup. Other issues include things such as the game forgetting your run configuration, so you run when you're not holding down the run button, and numerous little glitches when you're editing your home. I once ran into a glitch where I was trying to move something inside of the tent and the entire tent started moving on its own. Plot editing in general is loaded with little glitches like that. There's been times where I try to edit a room's windows and press Up to scroll the view and the edit option goes away and the Esc key does nothing. Seriously broken stuff. However, most of this pales in comparison to the biggest problem the game has so far, which is the fact that the developers rarely take player feedback, or even bug reports, seriously. Oh, and the cosmetics are WAY too expensive. Their business model is completely stupid. People would be more inclined to purchase cosmetics if they brought the prices down considerably. As it stands, expect to pay $20-$30 for most cosmetic items. That's way past the threshold most people are willing to pay. Bring it down to under $10 a pop and way more money would be going into the game, which would allow for more money to pay staff, which would lead to a better game. My only other gripe with this game, and it's kind of minor compared to the other major issues but is still important to me and many others, is the total lack of aesthetics when it comes to your player character. This follows the current-day trend of character amorphism. If you play as a female character, don't expect to see any kind of feminine beauty. Your character will be washboard-flat and you cannot change this. If you play as a male character, don't expect to be physically masculine at all. You're a feminine stick insect and you cannot change this. All of the base outfits lack any kind of cuteness or appeal, and even most of the premium outfits are similarly sterile. This is, as they call it, an "appeal to the modern audience", which everyone knows does not actually exist. The only time I see other players even wearing premium cosmetics are when they're among the very few items that actually add some feminine charm to their character. Cuteness and sex appeal sells, people...

Oh... and Cooking is a terrible skill. Worse than Fishing. Overcomplicated minigame that only exists to allow for party-type skilling. The interface is awful and unintuitive and the steps don't usually make any sense.

So all in all, yeah... it's got massive amounts of issues, but it's also got massive amounts of charm. This game has a ridiculous amount of potential, but is being kneecapped by amateur buffoonery and current-day social apologetics. It's absolutely worth playing though, and is easy to get addicted to.</p>

      <p>Graphics are beautiful definitely has its moments where NPC's get stuck in an action, but they have a timed schedule, so their body will just look like it's being dragged by magic. Quests are straight forward, but can be time-consuming with the material gathering. Also, navigating travel before getting a glider is a little difficult but very picturesque, but I’m looking forward to more lore while following the main quest line. Besides, I immediately fell for Hassian and his mom, Sifuu.</p>

      <p>Palia is a decent game, maybe, if you stay completely free to play. I would not recommend purchasing anything from the cash shop because it was not that long ago when we couldn't equip many of the cash shop items we had already purchased. This was not cause for alarm on their end. It took them several weeks to fix the issue, and there was never any compensation for the delay for those who had already purchased the items that we could no longer equip.

With each new update, they manage to make this game less and less functional. The game has been plagued with game breaking glitches, including but not limited to: broken tool swapping, broken zone swapping, broken group functions, not being able to use your purchased cosmetics for weeks at a time, can't move items on your plot, can't find items that were on your plot but have now vanished into the ground, players falling through the ground on a loop and getting stuck under buildings/terrain that have vanished, etc. Instead of focusing on improving game play by fixing these issues, they just keep adding new features. We can't swap tools to collect resources during actual game play, but now we can emote at each other with colorful stickers! (insert angry Hassian sticker here)

They never fail, however, to add new items for purchase in the cash shop. Every single update, without fail, includes more digital stuff to buy. Even during the period of time where none of us could use our tool cosmetics because they were causing people to crash, they still managed to release additional cosmetics... including new tool skins!!!

The story is pretty good, the paid cosmetics are super cute, and there is an abundance of cute free to play outfits as well. The cozy piece of this "cozy game" fails because of the frustration from the glitches and they have completely lost my trust as far as the cash shop goes. It's not unreasonable to expect to be able to use the things you've paid for, unless you are a character in Palia. I would love to see them fix the issues with this game because it really was great while it lasted but as I said, buyer beware on the cash shop.</p>

      <p>Palia is a fun, relaxing game. Plenty to do and while the world isn't very big, it's still engaging. The NPCs are interesting and somewhat dynamic similar to Stardew Valley. The community is all in all very friendly and not toxic. Being able to gather resources as a group and share drops is definitely a bonus.</p>

      <p>Hours 342 on steam, direct launcher unknown hours. Total is at least 500. Support is poor defaulting to blaming user hardware. Support is otherwise unresponsive. Programmers are forced to create content for sale and not fix errors. Errors fixed are cosmetic related rather than function related. Functional and Loading errors that existed in the first patch after August 2023 still exist. New content is minimal consisting of anything that generates money. Playable content is full of errors (textual, functional. and cosmetic).

Do not bother.</p>

The collecting dolls is a meh and so is the weird dating the NPC's thing.

Why have a waterfall in the "plot" part of the game, at the mine. And not have a cool chest or something behind it.

The game is absolutely marvelous. It's beautiful and has a lot of cool quirks. I feel like this is the offspring between sunhaven/stardew and wizards 101. It's awesome!</p>

      <p>It's a really pretty game, but that's about it. There's not much else to it. Some story and some quests. A typical farm-management game but it's a free-to-play game, so expect some cash-grab content. Now, don't get me wrong, I love farm-management games. But I got more from Stardew Valley, Sun Haven, and Slime Rancher. There's a few more out there, but I find them much more ful-filling. I can't say that's not fair against Palia. It has potential, truly but it's really not for me. I feel there's too much running around for quests and not really focusing on much else.</p>

      <p>Palia is currently my go to game. The fact that you can play for free blows my mind!

I love that though you get to the end of one part of your story, you can keep going and going. There is so much to explore and build and being able to play solo or team up with others is fantastic. Majority of players are ready to explain things to help a newbie out 

Graphically beautiful and exciting to see new outfits/pets and so forth coming in fairly frequently. I should note that these do generally require some form of payment (especially the pets), but there is a variety of clothing options for free and given the quality of game we are receiving I feel is more than fair for a little individualisation if you want it.</p>

Although there are still bugs here and there, the characters and map are well designed, and I find myself always wanting to continue the grind of crafting, gathering, and fulfilling quests. 
Also, can't stress enough how amazing this game is for being absolutely free!!! No paywalls other than extra additions to your own character! It doesn't effect gameplay at all!</p>

      <p>This is a fun cozy game where you're not constantly fighting an energy bar and feeling limited to only certain tasks and areas. There are a lot of main storyline quests and side quests so you never feel like you've run out of things to do. You can create and customize your character and play online with friends as well as interact with the villagers and even romance them if that's something you're into. To me, this game gives Free Realms vibes (IYKYK).</p>

      <p>Almost 70 hours in, and really enjoying it. It has the play style I loved in ACNH, with more complex graphics and functionality (reminds me a little of dreamlight, touch of breath of the wild vibes). Beautiful graphics, great story, lovable characters. 

I really only have 2 things that make it less enjoyable for me to play:
-hit boxes need work. Some quests, but definitely gardening, can be very tedious. For example, finding the hit box on the flow gates was so hard I thought the quest glitched. 
-weapon switch for hunting. Love the idea of chopping a tree and finding animals, but the mechanics of switching from ax to bow is rough. Maybe its better on switch, but for PC it could use a key assignment.</p>

It's cozy, graphics are really good, and there are so many things to do at your own pace that you'll never run out. I really suggest you try this out if you're looking for a game to just play at your own pace.

Needing to look up guides for every quest got old quickly. I understand the idea is to have players spend hours in game figuring out quest but this is to much. Cooking is a cool concept but it is to complicated as well.  Ingredients take to long to grow and collect only to have cooking fail with one step left even after looking up a guide. I wanted to love this game as it has some cool concepts and game play but some aspect just make it unbearable.</p>

      <p>This game is really cozy and fun to play by yourself and with friends!! I truly enjoy the plethora of things to do as well as the special events. It's a grind. The quests and character backstories are also fun to read. Some things I do want to see are mounts with increased speed, more character customization with not having to buy a whole bundle/set for particular accessories, and possibly even an option to gift bundles/sets/accessories. Kudos to the developers!</p>

      <p>So relaxing and calm.  Cuteness abundance everywhere.  I've been playing another MMO for the past few years and it was PvP stressful and garnered aggravation.  This one is a calm sea. The players are so helpful.  The quests are easy to challenging.  I'm getting better, restful sleep at night after logging off the game.   The story lines are whimsical to melancholy.  It draws out some creativity you didn't know you had as you build up your home plots.  Have fun.  Cheers!</p>

      <p>What stands out the most is the sound mixing, it is beautiful and every item has a special sound associated with it. The scenery and graphics are also great, but can be buggy. The stories of the characters as you get to know them is one of my favorites of any game. Be aware the game is not finished and there are many story cliffhangers.</p>

      <p>Palia is a lovely cozy game with fantastic characters and fun quests. Fish, hunt, farm and build a house with no rush and no pressure. It's a great way to chill, with cute graphics and a beautiful world.

However any new player should be aware that the devs now seem more concerned with adding new cosmetics instead of actual content. Obvious they have to keep funding development but the cost for these items is crazy, especially considering the lack on meaningful updates other areas have had.</p>

      <p>The harvest game I've been craving, that doesn't have punishing MMO elements, instead sharing loot of those participating in things like hunting as well as buffs for anyone participating in the same activity near each other like fishing. NPC likes or "weekly wants' change weekly (IRL time every monday) so you have ample time to acquire items to increase your friendships or to progress your budding romances. 

My main qualms are the myriad of lil bugs & glitches: 

- Lighting tends to freak out when going from an indoors to outdoors (or vis vers), 
- Some terrain forgets its not supposed to be visible to a small hill becomes the only terrain in your personal plots back area, Going a certain depth into water tells the game to unstuck you with a blackout but if you jump or move out of that depth it freaks out and flashes you,
- Certain areas either do not have the climbing rule applied to it trapping you in between terrain or in water,
- Certain areas you should be able to jump but are incapable of traversing for no apparent reason.
- There is also issues with the fishing indicator as you cast, the way it blinks makes it hard to track how far it has gotten and the speed in which the cast moves doesn't help that.
- If you upgrade your home by adding a room, if the existing room's wall has items on it they will disappear. You have to leave the game then log in and check your storage.
- Some loot when dropped by the creature/tree/whatever will become invisible and you have to use your HUD's compass whilst frantically mashing F to find it.


Yet in spite of all that I find myself hopelessly addicted in my special interest hyper focus way. I can get enough enjoyment in daily minutia & ongoing stories to keep me playing.


Players from before my time tell me that this used to be a passion project worth following, but that now it just sits there rotting just finding new ways to convince you to spend money. A lot of the issues I have with the game are issues that have persisted for quite a while unfixed, as long as they can continue to make money then it hasn't been worth the newer owners' time. For this reason my wallet will never be open to this game.


Its a good game, could be a great one if it put in the work, but still worth my time at the very least until I find another that can provide the quality changes & future goals worth investing in.</p>

      <p>If you ever played the nintendo DS game Fantasy Life, and have a fantasy life shaped hole if your heart after 100%-ing that game, this is the thing to fill it. It's like if Fantasy Life and Stardew Valley had a baby that was an MMO. You have the freedom to choose which skills of many you'd like to advance in the most, a super fleshed-out social system with relationships that feel like they build across both multiple in-game and real-life days, a story that is pieced together slowly across fun puzzles over dozens of hours of play, and a world full of friendly people that feels full but is big enough to not feel crowded. 11/10 can't wait for the Elderwoods update!</p>

      <p>Been playing about a week now. First time this genre of game. It's pretty decent. There are quite a few bugs that can get annoying. Seems devs may be focused a bit more on cosmetics than fixing bugs in updates, from what I've seen and heard. 

It's in beta. It will get fixed. Loads of play value here. In-game community has been fantastic. No toxic kids like most games. Everyone just talking maturely and helping one another out, very nice to see in-game.

The story progresses nicely in the beginning, but within about 3 (irl) days once you get to the Watcher quest, things slow down DRAMATICALLY. My guess is lack of content after the whole Watcher questline, but it's literally like hitting a brick wall. I feel initial gameplay needs to be slowed down quite a bit for the moment as it doesn't take much atm to progress. The longest thing so far is finding a Shepp which involves a lvl 4 friendship which is my last remaining Main Quest (all sides so far completed).

7/10
Fix the bugs continue with content updates and it'll be a 10/10 in no time. Highly addicting and just chill relaxing game.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy this game, tho I am a little late to the party. I am pretty introverted in games is no different so the smaller player base doesn't bother me. I like the music, the world is peaceful to be in as a run around mining, gathering and cooking. The story so far seems interesting. The npcs are fun. My only real complaint and its kind of a big one, is I cant fish. I mean i know how you are supposed to fish but it just isn't working. for whatever reason my mouse doesn't move the line to keep it into the circle area. Honestly even if it did, its overlly complicated for a game built like this. Everything about this game is pretty simple except fishing. Why? idk. I want to catch fish I don't want to struggle to keep something in some tiny circle or fail. Even the cooking is extremely easy with the puzzles etc. Idk if its a pc thing but my mouse wont allow me to fish. I have tried at least 30 times and it just doesn't work.</p>

      <p>Palia gripped me by the throat last year and hasn't let go. It still blows my mind that this much content, of this quality, is available FOR FREE. There is a huge cast of characters that each have their own unique personalities and complexities, there is a fascinating lore for the world you find yourself in, and hours of content to interact with. It is a fantastic game to play with friends, and the number of times I have had or seen beautiful interactions with complete strangers in the game warms my heart. Genuinely, the game makes me feel that the world could be a nicer place if we are just nicer people ourselves. 

10/10, would recommend, only free-to-play game I have ever chosen to spend money on. That's how much I love it.</p>

      <p>Very nice game.  Beautiful art and sound to the point I seem immersed.  Many micro transactions to enhance the game, but not pay to win (P2W).  I emphasize some who say it's a money grab, but it depends on your opinion.  Great for young kids to socialize and engage in non violent gaming.</p>

      <p>Okay, so this is a bit complicated. Please bear with me.

I was there for the announcement of Palia. And for the beta. I shared my link, told all my friends, cuz the game idea was amazing to me. I legit could NOT wait to play it. When the beta opened, I worked *really hard* to get my laptop's graphics intel updated, downloaded all the packs, etc. It was a headache, but I was *so sure* it would be more than worth it. After all, the game description had been everything I had wanted in a game.
When we tried the beta, we were disappointed. We understood that this was just beta and were trying to give grace for early game development, but the controls were confusing, it was so laggy (taking FOREVER to load anywhere and kept kicking us), and we didnt feel like we were getting anywhere after hours of play. When we tried the shop for strength to press on? No way. Prices were WAY too high.
We ended up putting the game down, and I told myself it would be better when it released on Switch, where the controls would at least be more familiar for me. So I waited again. Eventually, it released, and I was excited to see the improvements.
But it wasnt much different. I found it incredibly difficult to feel engaged. I was still disappointed in the character design options, which, while better than a lot of games, was not offering what I wanted for my character look. And the shop was just so bad. To pay for a single outfit in the shop, you have to pay at least $15. That seemed bizarre to me, as I have had experience in Toram Online (another F2P game) and Rune Factory, Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, and FFXI (non F2P games). Palia doesnt have SO many mechanics that the others do, yet the only way to get cool outfits here is to pay, with ridiculously high prices. Even with the MagiMarket event, we just couldnt find the zeal to play.
I put the game down again and ended up removing it from storage on Switch (the sheer storage space it took up was utterly unsustainable for me). Something like a year has gone by, idk. I decided to try Steam and see what had changed. I endured the re-updating my laptop graphics (~2 hours), and, boy-- How is it STILL this glitchy and laggy? At least it didnt keep kicking me, but it was still noticeably bad. And the shop hasnt gotten better-- if anything, it's worse. No new free cosmetics (or character customization), no access to free pets, the prices are terrible and even apply to stickers now, the layout was still unintuitive, and I also couldnt find any way to change usernames. At every turn, the game has features locked behind a paywall, and to those arguing that the payable items aren't "functional"-- that depends on what you're calling function. There're no combat/pvp aspects in Palia, marketing itself as a chill sim-type game. That means having nice outfits, cute companions, cool land terrains, and stickers/emotes are ALL parts of the core *functions* of the game (literally all related to the very appeal and substance of the game). But I digress. I tried to see the rest of the game by itself, treating the shop like DLC. Yet despite spending 4-5 hours of dedicated play this time, I barely got my house built, not a single relationship moved beyond level 1, I kept having to run all around (which takes FOREVER) for quests just to get one baby step forward, and spent an unreasonable amount of time just waiting on things like wood planks to process. I'll say, some features seem to have improved, and I think a couple of mechanics were added, changed, or streamlined (all good), but a lot less than I would have expected for the time elapsed. There were certainly countless of added shop items. Surely a few more mechanics, maps, or free stuff could have been expected? And Twitch drops kind of feel similar to a paywall. Like, "Sure, we'll give you a few cute things occasionally, but only if you come promote our socials and add money to us by engaging in our content". Not that they're the only ones who do this, but it becomes more apparent with the rest of the frustrations. 
Before anyone mistakes me as a hater: The concept is great. They have several clever ideas, and I enjoy the aesthetic vibes. As much as the sim-ish look and over-the-top expressions bother me, the devs did seem to have put a lot of effort into personality, story, and design for each NPC. I sincerely applaud that. I get what people mean when they say, "It's F2P, so just buy a couple of outfits from the shop and consider it the payment for the game to support the devs". But the prices are so high, and the rest of the gameplay so weak and so slow. If I attempted to purchase enough outfits to make me content with a purely aesthetic game and counted it as the adjustable cost for the game, I would feel as though I had purchased a half-finished game. This isn't beta anymore. It shouldnt be this bugged or laggy, and it shouldnt be so slow and grindy. I like that it has room to grow, but there are some lessons Palia can learn from similar games like Sky CotL. Like it or not, the cosmetics are a large portion of appeal to an rpg-- that's why so much attention is put on them. Sky is a similarly story-driven sim-type F2P game, and it doesnt have all the npc interactions or farming-sim (though they did recently add customizable housing). The beauty, story, music, character design, and co-op gameplay make Sky highly appealing to so many people. Recently, their biggest issue has been varying currencies that have lessened the chill aspect and made it feel too grindy, losing a lot of people (even I barely play now) while also raising prices and feeding off FOMO to drain their audience. Toram is amazing for F2P, and it's brought me to literal tears over their gacha odds, losing me in the process. But they have so much more going on than Palia. And there are SO many free cosmetics, not just gacha, dyeable and adjustable. And Niki's Dressup similarly does a gacha thing, though the scarcity of resource and grind of gameplay was what lost me there too. If you're seeing a trend, it's because there is one.
Please dont misunderstand me-- I 100%-ed EoW and have ungodly numbers of hours on BotW and TotK. I'm also combing through post-game Hogwarts Legacy for every Merlin Trial, Vault, Quest, etc. I do not mind grind, effort, or time, but the journey should be nearly as enjoyable as the destination, or else the rewards are empty/effort unsustainable. This applies to co-op functions, character customization, payable content-- All of it should be giving the player a sense of enjoyment in the actual play. The grind may be taxing but it's still fun. You may have to cough up some money for some payable content, but it feels worthwhile and not overbearing. You should be able to tell a story with your character design-- that's the whole appeal to custom characters at all. We want it to feel like us or whatever we're trying to be. Whatever we're trying to voice. A game should not feel like work or it ceases to be a game. Games are meant to be fun, uniting, and fulfilling. I wish the gaming industry would not forget this. I know games are still products that must be marketed, but dont forget the value of the product in the effort to make value out of it....

I genuinely WANT to love this game. I still think it has so much untapped potential. My hope is that perhaps the devs will research to find what works that love-of-the-game more so into Palia. I hope that one day I can return again to this game and find the journey to be genuinely fulfilling. I could say that maybe this game just wasn't designed for me, but not only are there numerous functional errors but also so many other voices repeating the same things. I sincerely wish the best for this game.

Wishing all the best and much love,

~LilKetsi~

Edit: I am seeing more potential and am powering through. I still wish I could answer neutral, but for now we shall see....</p>

      <p>This is a really fun game, and I find it very enjoyable. Only problem I've been having is that weird crash "pure virtual function called while application is running (GIsRunning == 1). So that's been very frustrating. 

The game was running fine, and I decided to change my settings down a bit after a few hours of playing. I looked at a recommendation for best running on low spec pc and it said to switch to DirectX 11. After I did that, this crash has been happening almost non stop. I either can't get IN the game past the initial loading screen, or it crashes mid game after a little under an hour. 

So, I'd say, if you have a low spec pc, be careful with messing with the settings because my game was fine until I did that :( I've done the force run dx11 by going into properties on steam and typing in -dx11 and it helped me get back into the game, but then it just crashed again after 30 minutes :') 

Very fun and enjoyable game otherwise!!!</p>

      <p>The game can be kind of super buggy sometimes but that's mostly just with visuals like the UI, models not showing up (rejoin the game to fix that bug), player and npc models going through the floor, and sometimes I'm unable to click on specific UI. I've never experienced serious lag or have had any issues with data not being saved- I've seen negative reviews on that but I personally have never dealt with that. The game is insanely addicting and there's so much you can do and it's all for free. All you have to pay for is cosmetics- which, in my honest opinion, is pretty seriously overpriced. I'm aware that cosmetics are the only way the devs can make money off this game but an outfit being $25 USD is insane, I don't care lol. I want to support the devs and I have spent money in the game, but it is genuinely ridiculous to me. But the base game is free and there isn't any p2w or paywall for more content behavior going on, so I don't really mind that. You can do every single thing the game offers all for free and it's a pretty big game. I'm sure some of the quests may be boring or frustrating for people (me included) but I believe the game offers enough, even if I paid for the game I think I would still find massive enjoyability in it so the fact that it's free is very generous just in my opinion, at least. The villagers are so sweet I love getting to know them, even the ones I don't like right off the bat, I learn more about them over time and it gives me such a good understanding of their character type and the village's general vibe and it's honestly so nice. I highly recommend this game, I've never played something this fun and addictive before. My only real complaint is that the premium shop is overpriced (completely). Again, I know that's how they make their money but damn. Borderline every item (like an outfit) is $20 minimum...I don't think the price points are defendable lol.

Also the game mechanics are actually really nice! The fishing minigame is smooth and doesn't require you to hurt your hand clicking which is very nice and pleasant because every other game's fishing minigame requires stuff like that which is obnoxious. Also there's Einar. Best robot.</p>

      <p>Such a cozy game with a pleasant community. Even in early release I've really enjoyed my time playing. Decorating your own plot feels very similar to Animal Crossing, and you even get to tour other plots to check out what others have done. I happily gave money to this little free to play game, to ensure that the devs can keep improving it!
All that said there are some rough parts. The controller support is very early stages and I'll have moments where the game does not respond to my controller, though it's largely just been a minor inconvenience. The most obnoxious time is when I'm cooking and I'll chop one or two ingredients then the next one will not recognize my controller and I'll have to switch to mouse. But I've never had an issue with the controller that's hindered me while fishing, hunting or bug-hunting! And speaking of early access, there are bugs in the game play like one of the games not working right during the festival week, which can only be remedied by exiting and re-entering the area, at which point you've already missed half the game.  And sometimes you'll try to enter a new area and the loading screen will spin for a bit then pop you right back where you were, so you have to try again. Mostly annoying if you're trying to get somewhere at a specific time, but never takes more than a single attempt before it response correctly.
But that said all my complaints can easily be tied to it being early access, and I'm confident that they're working on fixing these bugs!

What others have said about it being grindy are true, and that's not for everyone, but I quite enjoy it. Because in this game there's a reward for the grind, and it never takes to long to get what you're looking for.
Unless you're looking for silk. That's always a slog. 

Looking forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer as it continues improving!</p>

      <p>Woefully incomplete and unbalanced but still fun - an endless loop of the same activities but its easy and relaxing. Clothing is mostly paid and very limited for free/new players and it crashes all the time. It has potential to be amazing but it keeps missing the mark with adding paid outfits instead of more expansive game content. 

Warframe has me spoiled though</p>

It has everything you need in a game, from decorating your house in any way imaginable to finding a nice cozy spot and fishing for a couple of hours. 10/10 recommend for a chill night.</p>

      <p>The game was very fun to play at first. 
However, after spending quite a bit of time playing. I feel as though the progression can relate to building a base on Clash of Clans. It can almost feel annoying needing to grind so much to craft furniture and decorate your plot. Some higher tier resources can be very difficult to find. I have played over 100 hours and progress has felt so slow. I go on expeditions to gather resources and will spend an hour in real life gathering them- only to be able to find enough things to craft one piece of furniture. Which I might not even be able to craft since smelting some of the ore can take a couple hours in real life depending on what it is. The cash shop is extremely expensive- an outfit can cost $30-$50 USD and is only cosmetic. It would be cool if pets had unique quirks or abilities but they are also only cosmetic. You play and grind and its a lot of fun but you get to a point where finding resources is so difficult and time consuming that you lose motivation to play. There are also quite of few random bugs which I have never really dealt with before. Buildings going invisible, stairs not necessarily becoming invisible but my character will disappear and then reappear at the bottom. Their is practically no story which is also kind of a bummer. Whatever quest there are feel somewhat repetitive and anti climatic. Building relationships with villagers takes a long time so much so I don't remember the last time i did a quest. The quest will have you running around the whole map which can get pretty annoying as well. After playing for some time if this game had costed anything I dont think I would have bought it knowing what i do now. It was fun- but now things can take multiple hours in real life to complete- similar to clash of clans which has caused me to completely lose motivation.... again fun at first but only if you have A LOT of time to spare to play and grind for resources. I have put 109 hours into this game and am STILL barely making any money from farming apple trees and other resources as well. Not sure if I will keep playing anymore which is a bummer because the concept was there but I am assuming new management? has completely shifted the focus to in game purchases.</p>

      <p>I wanted to like this game, but it's just a game full of doing chores. After 20 hours, there's no combat that I've seen other than hunting, and that's pretty basic. The adventuring is pretty basic, and co-op doesn't amount to anything because there's really no combat. You just run around and explore, and that only amounts to a few hours of gameplay. This game is pretty boring.</p>

      <p>This game is so fun and relaxing! It doesn't feel like a chore at all to level up skills and I find the characters really charming! The art style is beautiful, and the music/ sound effects JUST WOW. I'll be playing and say to myself "dang I wish I could do this.." AND I CAN DO IT, like climbing cliffs, having exact placement grids for decorating, and even the cooking skill is just so cool! This game takes my least favorite part of home building games like decorating, and makes me want to make my house fun and pretty. This is like all of my favorite games mashed into one, but with EXTRA DETAIL, it just feels unique but familiar. Palia is in Beta testing, good lord I can't wait to see it fully developed, this game is FANTASTIC!</p>

      <p>I really enjoy this game. It's more of a cozy game, and, at first, the game might start off slow. Once you start completing side quests and exploring the world more, the game gets a heck of a lot more interesting!! I know I saw one reviewer mention the lack of ways to get coins, but once you progress your story line with [spoiler] Zeki [/spoiler], this isn't as much of an issue. 

I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes Stardew Valley, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and/or Zelda. It's a good mix of all of these games plus some fun and unique characteristics as well!</p>

I didn't get that far. 

The game looks great, controls great and obviously has some love put into it, but the gameplay loop is just fetch quests. There's literally nothing else to do.</p>

      <p>Running simulator.
Map are biggish (that's cool) but the constant running back and forth is frustrating. There isn't enough fast travel points.
This game need mounts for faster travel.

Also, this game it's WAY too grindy. I don't mind grind games, I like them, but the bugs and fishing is bullshit. Chances for you to get what you need/want its so infuriating since the RNG is SO BAD in this game. There is no satisfaction collecting everything since you cant get anything. Also devs made palium farming shit. You used to get it alot more, not anymore.

Cosmetic are OVER PRICED. I get it, they need to get money somehow, but still... No.

There is no End Game content. If you don't care so much about decorating, you'll run out stuff to do.

Big minus for toxic community.

Mostly this game leaves me frustrated and that's not how cozy games should work.</p>

      <p>This game is beyond entertaining. I'm completely hooked. All I have to say is more quests, more plushies, more pods, more Makeshift, more abundance of shrooms and other gatherables, more events, easier time obtaining Maji Market tickets, more hairstyles and character customization options, more endurance and speed for climbing, more control when fishing, more types of bugs and fish, etc. I'm sure I have more more`s, but that's good for now. :) I'd like cheaper clothing in the premium shop. I do find them too overpriced.</p>

      <p>This game is still showing as beta version but even with a few par for the course "teething troubles", I am really enjoying it. 
It has all the best elements of some of my favourite games, there are plenty of fun discoveries and rewarding finds for exploration, it has a great vibe and encourages supporting other players. 
Personally, I am less likely to benefit from the team elements because I have to play at a slower pace and find chatting during game play difficult, even so I have experienced passive benefits from just doing at activity near other players. It's fun and challenging and I hope to be in Palia for a long time to come. Can't wait to see it evolve and the potential for new areas and discoveries fulfil itself.</p>

      <p>Very fun and casual harvestmoon game!

- Hunting and bug catching need improvement with range indicator!
- The crosshair they using for everything is mostly used for grappling hook in other games but this game does not have grappling hook, which is confusing! Because this big arse crosshair also blocking the screen view when you enable the always on for reduce motion sickness...it should be just a single dot crosshair when not doing hunting or bug catching seriously!
- Copper ore only drop 2 ore per mining and the amount is the same when mining the smallest rock and biggest rock...you need 5 ore to make a single ingot...it is difficult to find the ores already! This need to be changed to give more ores!
- There's some bugs make world invisible that you can fall through the ground.
- Wish there is player trading.</p>

      <p>I have had way too much fun with this game because it fully allows me to switch gears whenever I lose interest in a particular area. Bored of grinding for fish? Switch to hunting for profit. Stuck on a quest? Find a new one somewhere. Things like that. So if you really need a linear structure to enjoy a game, this may not be for you. But if you have a short attention span, this is fantastic. Also, the players are incredibly friendly and helpful!</p>

Such a cozy experience, no stress but loads to learn and do. The community has been really nice too so far, willing to help and share in rare loot. All in all I'm excited to keep playing, even if I keep getting d/c'd when I play on my deck. :/</p>

      <p>It's definitely still working through some glitches in the Beta, and the storyline has slowed down dramatically while we wait for updates. However, this is a really enjoyable community game. It's a collection of fairly simple skills used to advance the story or just keep to yourself and build up your plot- you goal is entirely up to you, and how you want to play it.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy Palia; this is exactly what I was looking for. I really like all the MMO elements, quests, and the fact that the game is not scary. I play this game with my friend, and we both love it!

I play this game on Ubuntu 24.04 with the following Steam settings: Settings -> Compatibility -> Proton Experimental. Sometimes, the game shows an error on the loading screen—just click "wait" and it will load. I have not encountered any other problems besides that. My friend had the same error once on Windows, so it's probably a bug in the game.
Also, I suggest adjusting the settings of the game to have more details so you can see further and spot bugs or deer.</p>

      <p>Somewhat confusing when you first start out but once you get the hang of it, you're hooked. Others in the server are quick to help though, it's very interactive. It's a great game and recommend downloading it while it's free. Only negative is it does get mundane with transportation around the maps.</p>

      <p>Really enjoying Palia so far. A lot of reviews mention bugs, and there definitely are some, but it's not nearly as bad as some people make it sound. It's entirely playable right now, but maybe it wasn't before I started.

It's very cozy, each villager has their own personality, there are a lot of quests, and it has a pretty decent overarching story. You can do whatever you want and take your time with just about everything. You get benefits from playing with friends, but you don't miss out on anything by playing solo.

The only thing I'd really like added is more progression. Even just something like 1 more tier of tools and the things to make them would be awesome. The next big update might just do that since there is supposed to be an entirely new area.</p>

      <p>Very enjoyable builder-type game.  The art-style is great and the level of customization when building your farm & house are exceptional.  The main story is intriguing and some of the mini-games are unique and enjoyable--cooking is great. And when you get to the underground, Hot Pot is addictive and well-worth spending and in-game night on.   It's an MMO, which you rarely see in this genre, but while you are encouraged to team up, you can definitely play solo, if that's your style. 

Only potential downsides are it does get a bit grindy trying to keep up with all you need to build, but that's to be expected with something you can really put your mark on.  And it does seem to lack any sense of danger, but that's minor at best.  

Overall, great game.  It has micro-transactions for cosmetic purposes, but it's definitely no pay-to-win.  If this is your type of game, it's a fine addition to your game list.</p>

      <p>This game is a nice relaxing peaceful experience. You can play with others if you want, and there are things to encourage you to collaborate with others; plus everyone in the game is really nice. I like how the story plays out kinda slowly to allow you to gather resources and spend time decorating. There are a few bugs that lock you out of mission rewards but none have been game-breaking for me so I don't care that much.</p>

      <p>This game boasts a captivating early game with a rewarding sense of progression and exploration. However, the late game experience suffers from a lack of engaging content and repetitive tasks.

Points for improvement:

Endgame Content: Introduce new challenges, goals, or systems to keep players engaged after maxing out tools and levels. 

1. Challenging dungeons or raids: Offering unique rewards and requiring strategic group play.
2. Competitive modes: Introducing PvP or ranked leaderboards for various activities.
3. Crafting Revamp: Adding more complex and rewarding crafting recipes with rare materials.
4. Endgame Storylines: Developing new quests and storylines that delve deeper into the game's lore and offer meaningful choices.
5. Resource Gathering: Reevaluate the tedious nature of resource gathering.  
6. Increased drop rates: Make rare resources like palium ore more readily available.
7. Alternative acquisition methods: Introduce quests, trading, or alternative activities to obtain resources.
8. Streamlining gathering mechanics: Reduce the number of steps involved in gathering certain resources, like silk.

Narrative Development: Enhance the story with

1. More compelling characters: Develop characters with deeper backstories, motivations, and relationships.
2. Meaningful choices: Introduce choices that impact the story and world in noticeable ways.
3. Environmental storytelling: Utilize the game world to tell stories through hidden details and lore.

By addressing these points, the game can provide a more fulfilling and engaging experience for players in the long term.</p>

      <p>The first time I played this game I rage quit because I was having trouble just figuring it all out idk. Then last week I picked it back up with a friend who's been showing me the roped and NOW it's enjoyable. I finally feel like I know what I'm doing. But I had so many questions, if he hadn't been there I probably would've uninstalled it again. It's  little buggy/laggy for me but still a super cozy gaming experience with a decent amount of things to do. 

I will say it bugs the absolute crap out of me that I had to start playing on a different steam profile in order to start a new save/character. I didn't want to start playing again on a save that I had initially started a year ago. Total pain in the ass. Forever waiting for them to either fix that or introduce a multiple save option. 

All in all 7/10 because it's free to play so it's worth the try. 

Free to play probably also explains why the cosmetics are SO expensive. Insane</p>

      <p>Palia has all the aspects that I like from World of Warcraft combined with some great elements of Animal Crossing. An odd combination at first glance, but the developers of this game have knocked it out of the park. Crafting is interesting and collecting materials isn't terribly grindy. I particularly like the fishing mechanic which is very different from other games that I have played. Finally, the wholesome atmosphere is really good at helping me ignore the dumpster fire of American politics right now.

I haven't purchased any in-game content, but I going to very soon. I like the business model of this game and I hope it works for the developers. It seems more than fair and it's great that those with means can support a nice game while allowing those with less to enjoy it just as much.</p>

      <p>Palia is fun to me and i can see why ppl still play it.
I got 65 hours so far in Palia and i dont think all stop soon and it make me feel a bit more at home when i can play harvest moon new beginnings.
The skill level u get is nice give u a reason to play, work hard for ur progress and make just that more rewarding to me
Fishing is nice and fun i can just zone out a little well fishing good
Farm is really nice gives me the feeling i have to plan my crops and how to place them and i can weed my crops weird thing to say from me but i love it
And the Hunting i love it it make u use the land to me adventage and how to use my bow
The take it slow aspect is nice since i also play fast games and the game has alot of bugs where i can really impact me game, For Palia so far i have not notice big impacting bugs then the gliding to climing but that can be tricky to code well

Wat am seeing:
I have seen some ppl complain about the farm plot limit and other limites i get why but there ways to improve wat u can do

But i read alot of the review wat make me rase a eyebrown, Palia still in beta. Beta games have ALOT of bugs or problem and chance to come
The premium money yea it is pricey but in order for them to still make updates or chances to come  in the game cost money to keep it up and this on of there passive income</p>

      <p>It's a great game if you just want something causal and fun. While its harder to get some end game resources alone its still possible just a bit more difficult. There's a lot of small things to do in the game even after putting nearly 50 hours I've still not completed the main quest line (I get distracted lol) and I got a plenty left to do.</p>

      <p>5/5 Stars!

I was captivated by the games soothing atmosphere, stunning graphics and engaging lore. The NPCs are meticulously crafted, each with their own unique stories and backgrounds, making it so fun to befriend and learn more about each one. The game events are a highlight, offering exclusive items and activities that bring the community together. The underground layer is a fantastic addition, featuring entertaining mini-games and special items. 

What truly sets this game apart, it its exceptional community. I've had the pleasure of playing with friends and random players online, and I have yet to encounter a single rude or unhelpful player. The kindness and camaraderie among players create a warm and welcoming environment that makes the game an absolute delight to play.</p>

      <p>Wonderful game! especially for still being free, while i'm not complaining that its free..it still blows my mind for how much the game has drastically improved since it's release. I absolutely adore the individual NPCs and the options to romance a significant amount of them. I also truly admire how the husband/wife couples and the father/daughter couple both bring so much life to the game!. So many romanceable games I feel like don't highlight the family aspect of life anymore. I truly get so much wholesome vibes from how Badruu, Dalilah, N'ao and Auni react, truly a wholesome little family. I also love the different events the team has been popping out as of recently. Absolutely beautiful game! highly suggest it! I've converted 4 of my friends to join me in my Palia adventures and they were all obsessed from day 1.</p>

      <p>Fun 3D copycat of Stardew. Plenty of bugs, which is why it's still beta. I would pay for cosmetics but they're overpriced even at 50% discount and they don't look that great on other players I see. Most of the time the tricked out shinies just show as ghost generic avatars. I'd pay for farming square increases without starting a whole new plot, or being able to sell furniture instead of trashing it, or better house options. 

As is, the game would be solid if it didn't require server connection that cuts out a lot. I've clocked server loss intervals as fast as every 15 secs some days. Also, some of the server hosts post odd messages sometimes. But overall a good game.</p>

      <p>I like this game a lot, especially the different characters in the game and how there´s constantly something to do. But the wind temple is definitely bugged and unless you do everything in the correct order, you can´t progress anymore. And there´s nothing telling you in which order you should do it in before you do it. I find this very annoying and hope it will get fixed soon so i don´t have to restart the game, thanks. :)</p>

      <p>Enjoyable and very relaxing game with an amazing plot and home build system. Palia has a friendly and helpful community and the devs seem to update frequently.  Since its free to play, the cash shop serves as the only way to support the game and although the prices are high, the items are good quality.  If your looking for something stress free and fun, give it a try!</p>

      <p>This is honestly the best mmorpg I've ever played. It's super chill, there are no time limits on quests or anything. The quests that require other people to complete can be easily done, because practically everyone helps out, no strings attached, when someone asks!! And they're actually fun to do (in my opinion. I love team cooking lol). 

The community is really great. I haven't seen any spam bots or trolls after 83hrs of gameplay; and at daily events everyone is so polite and eager to share the spoils.

Also it'S free to play and NOT pay to win! There are microtransactions, but for cosmetics only.

Only con I have so far is the lack of diversity for character creation. I'd love to see different body types (skinny, muscled, fat, tall, small, etc.) and noses other than the button/d*sney style. Idk if the devs have mentioned this in their updates, but I think it would be a good thing to add in the future.</p>

      <p>Palia has everything that I love about cozy farming games, I honestly have no complaints. The crafting is fun and doesn't feel like a chore, Palia has common farming sim tasks like foraging, fishing, gardening etc. but I enjoy the way you garden and fish. I personally haven't come across a farming game that feels like Palia. They did a very good job making a primarily farming sim feel different than all the other farming sims out there. AND its free, the only in game purchases are cosmetics which I am much more willing to buy while playing a very well made free game. Well done, I look forward to seeing what the developers do with the game once out of beta!</p>

I truly enjoy playing Palia the quest are fun and some are very challenging to the point of having to google them sometimes. I enjoy trying to figure it out before looking it up but after trying to complete a quest over 2 hours real time I look it up. Also, sometimes this game just makes me feel like a complete idiot lol plenty of duh moments maybe it's just me who knows lol I look forward to spending my down time on the game. The Community is amazing and very helpful, kind not toxic in anyway, and very mature conversations not inappropriate  unlike many other games that have chat.</p>

      <p>I came. I played. Critique? Good world layout. Uninspired life sim style gameplay. Everything is a billboard with something on it but nothing works together and there's no challenge, you just grind away at tasks. 🤷‍♂️

Why bother with it? A game is meant to have gameplay. This doesn't.

If I wanted to play this, I might as well open Unreal Engine 5 and drop items into my work space while using one of the tools to build the landscape. It would amount to exactly the same thing without the repetitive wood and stone collecting.

Give it a miss.</p>

      <p>really enjoying the calmness of the game. I use to do farming on How to Train your Dragon, and already I'm finding this just as awesome. It's a peaceful environment where I can do whatever I want - Many villagers with wonderful character development. Think the best part is I can play on STEAM and when I'm not busy at work - on the Switch cross-progression!

This game is a lot of running around on errands for villagers that scatter depending on the time of day. You'll find yourself on watching your money, time and resource management. Nice little surprises found throughout the lands.</p>

      <p>Nothing has a time limit. Nothing. Play when you want, how you want. Sleeping NPCs will wake up to talk with you if you only have a little time to play. Quests that seem to have urgency do not actually. The only "consequence" to anything is not getting a star-quality dish if you mess up. Sort of an Animal Crossing/Stardew Valley hybrid, and for a beta tbh the visuals are so so consistent and nice.</p>

      <p>It was good for the first few months or so; I would have been alright about the cosmetics being at a premium if there were cosmetics meant for people to earn with in-game currency. As it stands, this game is a sluggish, lifeless, barren game that is only supplemented by a finite amount of ways to interact with people and the games' own characters. Once you hit palium and flow trees, it spells the game's doom. There is nothing to do but chitter away at the paltry amount of busywork this game has to offer. Do NOT play this if you're looking for anything meaningful. If you want to be bombarded by Singularity 6 basically begging people for money every patch, then by all means, go ahead and play this game.</p>

      <p>I have no idea if the game is good, sorry. I just know that I didn't realise that it was online multiplayer with strangers and that is not for me.
No blame attached to the game or its developers, of course, I could easily have found out before installing. 
Unfortunately I trusted a recommendation for a cozy-style game that did not mention that it was always-online and features the general public visible and active in your game experience. 
Since that's what turned me off Diablo IV and Fallout 76, I have no desire whatsoever to play a game with randoms wandering around in it.</p>

      <p>I downloaded this game a week and a half ago while I was sick because I didn't have the energy to play Overwatch. I now have 75 hours. The game is fun. It's a lot like Stardew Valley, but in a 3D MMO environment. The community is nice and for the most part works together for resources. I like that it doesn't rush you to get things done in a certain order. You can fish all day and you're not missing out on special events for example. Your farm is there when you get to it, nothing will die. Now that I'm back to work the passive income from seeding potatoes and jarring tomatoes and apples is huge, I came home to a 9k gold output. I will admit it may be too grindy for some people but I personally like grindy games.</p>

      <p>I have never found a game more enjoyable and relaxing. You can obtain all housing items in game and the only thing you actually pay real life money for are the cosmetics. You can do it all in this game, from hunting and fishing, to growing crops and catching bugs. It is an amazing, cozy adventure and there is no time crunches or having to worry about dying and losing your inventory. I highly recommend playing Palia! AND, its great for all ages and families.</p>

      <p>If you like Animal Crossing, this is the next best thing! Think of Animal Crossing mixed with The Sims! The game is entertaining to play! It's just like playing The Sims, but you have quests, play online, and with other people. The game is "FREE" to play. The only money you will spend will be for the costumes, pets, gliders, and different overlays for your tools. They have no real use, they are just aesthetics. Which are hard not to buy. I did buy a few. 

The only issue I have with the game, is with some of the players. Some players like to "shame" others for not sharing a resource. They also tend to gang up and "shame" players. Obviously, these are the same individuals who think that everyone should get a trophy for participation, even though their team lost! The same people who hide behind their keyboards and bully people. I allowed my little cousin to play with my character and she came crying to me that someone online said mean things to her (she is only 6). Don't say anything to them! STAY CALM! You don't have to share resources, but it is polite to share (only if you want to), it is not a "RULE." Just block them, and if you want to, you can report them for harassment. Only if!

Over all I give the game 8 out of 10 stars.</p>

I Dont know why this game managed to hook me.. but 324 hrs further.. I play it WAY more then the friend who asked me to try it out. I tent to forget there are quest to do and complete them by sheer accident. I just enjoy running around collecting things and hunt for Plushies.. a verry good game to just chill out in with friends and pass time</p>

      <p>Runs well on the Steam Deck, but you may need to change the default controls.

I am having a lot of fun playing Palia alone and with friends. There are incentives for playing in a group, like bonus loot. There are a lot of quests and building/decorating features for solo play. This game reminds me of Animal Crossing and Luma Island, both of which I also enjoyed.</p>

      <p>I love the way the characters, world, animations etc. look. Very clear and vibrant. The story is interesting to follow and the challenges are actually difficult at times. I only wish that the interactions with the NPCs were a little more in depth and the cutscenes/relationship milestones that go with them could be longer/more detailed/and not just things to do for them.</p>

      <p>As good as it is, there are some things which can make the game waaaay better.
1) Make a minimap feature.
2) Make the quest box smaller. It doesn't need to take up almost the entire right side of the screen.
3) Fix known bugs.</p>

      <p>Hello dear Singularity 6 developpers !
I've played for more than 50 hours of this game and I love it, there are so many things to do that you can't be bored !
But since I finished the mission in the Wind Temple, I'm encountering some problems. I have to do the quest in which the Gardener wants you to place some modules in different area, but my game crashes every time I want to go back to the Wind temple to place it there. 
Can you please tell me if anyone else have this problem or if you're working on fixing it please ?
Thank you so much for the game and your work !</p>

      <p>My best friend mentioned this game a couple of weeks ago and we decided to try it together. If you're a creative person, let me tell you, the sky is the limit (but not really). The game gives you so much creative freedom not just with the way you can decorate but what you can build too! Don't want a cottage? Build a treehouse or even a castle! The community is super friendly and welcoming to new players; never seen a more united community in any MMO before. The only downside thus far is the lack of maps but I'm sure that will change in due time. If you're looking for a super cozy game to ease down your anxiety or relax after a long and stressful day, this is the one.</p>

      <p>No. Sucks. The game We Happy Few was about the kind of people who claim to like extremely docile stuff like this. WHF was about people being controlled by drugs and censorship. Expect a lot of that if you make the mistake of trying to be real and have fun in this game. :)

Overall, the game is unplayable in many ways. I focus on the fact that it is a technical mess and overall unappealing.

(The ideological term speak with stuff like "body type" and "type A' and "type B" instead of 'man' and 'woman' makes this game unappealing in both fiction and non-fiction universes. Definitely do not let your impressionable kids play games like this one without supervision. Show the right things, not Palia that is some ideologically infested dogma project. )

Runs like a dead donkey in a tar funeral... on ice. 8 GB recommended my donkey - I have that on Win10 and it crashed during the intro cutscene following the character creation first time around. After that it was just a laggy mess.

A fun fact: you cannot disable anti-aliasing in this game - your screen will turn into a black box. Oh joy. It is super unoptimized even though it looks worse than most 20-yo games.

The loading times are horrendous with a non-SSD game and it wastes much more RAM than it claims to require.

The user interface feels floaty. There is no polish to it. I could not select axe that I had for some non-explained reason.</p>

It’s entirely free to play! The only occasions when you'll need to invest real money are if you wish to adopt a charming pet or customize your character's costume.

      <p>Loved the relaxing atmosphere and extremely non toxic fan base. Everyone is ready to help if u get stuck. Casual farming and hunting is enjoyable. The puzzles and story can also be a bit challenging, but not too much. The game probably could use some new content other then cosmetics but its still a good game to kill time on.</p>

      <p>If you like to be busy, it's easy to do that in this game. Farming for cooking ingredients, mining for gold, silver, copper, and iron, hunting, fishing, and chatting up the villagers keeps you on the move. But, if you prefer to spend time creating your home and improving your plot, that option is also available and really fun. People are generally nice and will readily answer questions if you need some guidance. You can also gather a party together to do all the tasks if you like social stuff. For loners, or on days you just want to chill and spend some quiet downtime, no one will bother you. It's a great game for everybody and for all levels of players.</p>

I can choose to play by myself, with a random Palian, or with a community. You can level up skills from hunting to cooking that can also be displayed and of course PLUSHIES. The markets and mini games keep you interested and I love the NPC's. I can't wait for the expansion to Elderwood.</p>

      <p>Very fun to sink time into if you like  laid-back games with strong multiplayer focus. Most of the game is made of fetching things for villagers and building a nice home. Some people might see this as a fetch quest oriented game. I personally enjoy the quest oriented system, the dialouge is so much fun and there's strong worldbuilding to discover alone or with friends. The friendship system requires real work, tied to actual real world time. (one gift an irl day) this is a good incentive to keep coming back. 

Keeping in mind that this is a Beta, I think the following additions would make the game a ton more enjoyable:

1) The farming system needs some love. Currently, the extent of farming progression is to unlock better tools and about 3 new crops. The system of crops effecting the growth around them is very unique and fun and i just wish there was more to it and hope that  future updates will provide some sort of rare seeds or cross breeding plants ect ect, really  just anything that means i can grow things not found in easily acessible stores.

2) I dislike the fact that the fashion system is entirely payment focused on microtransactions. if there wasnt a whole character dedicated  to clothing i wouldn't mind, but it makes me sad that there's nothing for me to craft and learn from with Jel like so many other characters. There are so many quests where you help Jel make an article of clothing but you never get to see or equip anything he makes as far as I know. Buying fancy cosmetics is fine, but community clothing would really up the game, if this isn't possible it would still be great to be able to make clothes with your loom, even if they were simple. if this also isn't possible I think everyone would be happy to buy some in-game currency priced outfits from jel's shop.</p>

      <p>This game is great if you just want a cozy farming sim. Fishing, bug catching, cooking, hunting, mining, foraging, and farming are all options in this game. The NPC's are fun and have nice individual personalities. I wish there was more to do with the hunting and mining. I feel like they could really dive deeper into the farming side of the game fore sure. I think the prices for the premium cosmetics is actually insane and the only thing I've bought so far is Zeki's daily login bonus. I was interested in getting the premium cosmetics but it's way too expensive for me. I hope to see them add more and more options to the game. Maybe more areas to explore, more characters to meet. Things like that. If you want something cozy and easy to play though then this is a good game for you.</p>

      <p>if you love decorating, hoarding plushies & shiny things as well as chasing animals that have done absolutely nothing wrong, this game is for you. 

the story? barely there. but who needs plot when you can spend hours arranging furniture and flexing your loot collection like a medieval dragon?  

also, the community is so absurdly nice that as someone coming from FPS-game lobbies, i assumed i had accidentally joined a cult.

      <p>At first it seemed like a good game but after a while it got really boring. I came back to play after months of break to see the changes but everything remained the same, only the players who spend money on clothes increased. You always have to do the same things and it always takes time to complete them.</p>

      <p>Immediately became uninterested in this game when I realized you have to BUY clothing. Wtf. No thanks. I'd rather pay for a game that actually has full, fun customization options, than download a free game and spend a sh*t ton of money on outfits. Characters didn't peak my interest anyway. Tbf I only played 3 hours so maybe it's a good game but every other game like its kind, or games I thought it was like (Sandrock, Stardew, etc. type games) caught me from the get go. This didn't. Also couldn't care less about the online aspect, just annoyed at constantly having to wait in loading screens because "2 other palians" are before me or whatever.</p>

      <p>From what I have played so far, this is a really cute game. Here are the Pros from what I have seen:
- Relaxing music & Gameplay
- Interesting characters and a great art direction
- Fun fishing mechanics
- Decent crafting mechanics
- Good character creation.

It takes out a lot of the stress of other games of its nature that would make your character crash from exhaustion or give you the ability to soft-lock yourself. While I don't care for the multiplayer, it's cool that you can chat and trade with others. Now for the Cons:
- Controller Support is clunky
- Minimap is not great
- Some tutorial directions are odd with their wording.

But that's really it? Overall it was something I was able to easily pour a couple of hours into mindlessly. And I had fun.</p>
