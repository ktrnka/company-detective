      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-22)</h4>
      <p>I have played this game for many more hours then my steam profile says as I spent a lot of my time playing on switch. I'm really sad to say but I cant recommend this game anymore since the priority is on the cash shop more then anything else. The game has been buggy and performing poorly for most of it's life and It hard to ignore when they find the time to come up with more and more things to shove into the cash shop.

This game has charm and is very fun if you are a fan of cozy games similar to animal crossing but want more then just bug catching and fishing. Characters are fun enough and the game is pretty good in the beginning so if you want something new to play its worth considering. The real issue is the lack of things to do, bugs and the lack of quests.

I played this game for hours and almost everyday when I first started but after a point the content just stops and you have to wait for them to drop 1 or 2 new quests for the characters stories and it gets old. Try it if you want but dont expect it to keep its charm for more then 100ish hours.</p>

      <h4>Thumbs Up (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-02)</h4>
      <p>I have been following this game since the summer of 2021, and have been playing it since it was first released on August 10th, 2023. During that time, they have made many changes to the game's features to improve gameplay.

You don't have to pay anything to play, and anything that costs money is purely cosmetic. However, almost every update is about adding more to the premium store, rather than fixing bugs in the game that has been there for months, soon to be years.

I'm giving Palia a positive review because it's a fun game to play, especially with friends. The community is also very helpful so that you can play the game alone and still get help doing tasks where you have to be several people to complete. Just be aware that there are many bugs in the game, and they probably won't be fixed anytime soon.</p>

      <p>This game had loads of potential, HAD. I clocked 50 hours fairly quickly when I started playing, it really pulled me in. HOWEVER, the more time you spend in the world the more you see the gaping void that was papered over with a lovely cover. 

There is no depth to the game whatsoever. The relationship system is incomplete so it looks like you can really go places but in reality they never finished it. They also created arbitrary obstructions such as a currency cap, absurdly few crop tiles for farming, and inventory/storage limits. The moment I started seeing how much work has been left unfinished and how these ridiculously limiting factors impacted my game-play, I lost interest. 

I stopped playing in December of 2024 and as of this post I returned to the game page to see if any updates have been made. I was not surprised when the only updates that had been made were additions to the games cash shop. At this point, their focus is on making items that people will buy because that gives them profit. 

Honestly, the player base is feeding the beast that has destroyed many a promising game. You see, people are buying the overpriced trash that is being added to the cash shop. Each purchase reinforces and further incentivizes the developer to continue prioritizing the cash shop over the actual game. Until players stop rewarding developers in this way, nothing will change and why should it? It is easy money for them to create a few items and rake in the money.</p>

      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-02-10)</h4>
      <p>TL:DR: Stardew Valley, Coral Island, My Time At Portia, My Time At Sandrock, the entire Harvest Moon series, Animal Crossing are only a few of the games that not only does what Palia tries to do, but they all do it better and with far more value for your time.  Is it still fun and pretty? Yes, but if you haven't played these other games first I highly recommend playing those games before investing any time / money in this one until it is more developed.

Cons:
This game is absolutely not in any shape to be selling 30$-50$+ items to its playerbase.  It is very much STILL in early access despite all of the developers, time, and money invested into this game.

Is it pretty? Yes, play Coral Island instead.
Is it expansive? Not that I've seen so far.  I've only seen 2 playable zones so far. There's another one on the way.  It feels really small to be spending 100s of hours in. Play My Time At Sandrock instead.
Does it have enough systems to keep me busy? Absolutely not, play any of the games I've mentioned.

Major key features it's missing are; 
1. Any sort of individual identity: Coral Island has recycling machines, earths spirits, an entire mermaid storyline and farming system - this game has nothing but knock off night elves from WoW
2. Ranching: zero animal raising or item collection / processing but still plenty of recipes that require these items which HAVE to be purchased from vendors
3. Pure Solo Play: players are required for endgame materials.  Yes it's a MMO but it is also a casual game, and a light populated one at that
4. Extra / Alt characters: you can only make 1 character per account.  You can change your character's appearance for free, however you can never change your character's name

Politics: This game is riddled with it.  No genders only body type, constant references to the main themes of radical politics as well as cringey slogans being used all over the game, and I could go on.  For me this is a negative, however I'm just presenting this information for people to know before investing their time in the game.

Pros:
1. Graphics are pretty if you enjoyed circa 2007 World of Warcraft Burning Crusade Silvermoon / Blood Elf area.   I appreciated that time period so I did enjoy the graphics.
2. Ease of Play: Despite low budget looking animations, the controls feel very fluid and fun.  Hunting is my favorite part so far and it is very rewarding and easy to do.
3. Ease of building / customizing: The building system in this game isn't anything new or special, but it is fun to use.

Overall, it's still too early for me to recommend this game to anyone, despite me putting hours into the game.  It's just not ready yet.  It really needs to implement a travel system (horses / animal transformation for transportation / vehicles / something), some sort of specific identity to explore (mermaid / underwater forms, wings / skyform or farming, something to set it apart), and it desperately needs a thorough ranching system.  Otherwise, I suggest for people to wait until they're ready for a launch.</p>

      <p>do not recommend this game /now/, in its current state, but i really hope i get to come here in the future and edit this to say i've changed my mind

-
palia has a lot of potential, but the company seems intent in driving it all into the ground.

i'll start by saying that as of right now, jan/2025, this game is still in beta despite it not being made clear here nor on the switch. you'll have to pay very close attention when you boot up the game to find the tiny little 'beta' in the game's login screen. and as beta game, it has very, /very/ limited content. patches are monthly, but the only things they bring are premium cosmetics - /all/ cosmetics and pets cost real $$$, and they're not cheap, either, but they also don't bring anything new to the game or your character aside from ✨looking cute✨; even the pets only just follow you around and you can't even interact with them, pet them, nothing. content updates are very few and sparse, and even the seasonal events are simply a copy of the previous year. 

the environment is gorgeous and i'm personally very invested in the lore; there's still so much to discover, but after burning through all of the main story quests in like two weeks, i've been forcing myself to find other things to do, because a beautiful world only goes so far. i'd cut it some slack for being in beta - if they at least were honest about it. the community, on the other hand, is a blessing. for the majority of the time you'll find kind and helpful people, especially on the discord, but ingame too. people will share resources and answer questions, and everyone tends to be very nice. it's a breath of fresh air from other multiplayer games.

speaking of community - the thing that hurts the most is the blatant disregard from S6 for our feedback. certain issues can take months, if not a whole year to be addressed - i'm looking at you, snowball flashbang. palia is marketed as a cozy, comfy game, yet it has issues with VFX and flashbanging which put player's lives at literal risk; mini-games and plataforming mechanics which render certain main story areas unplayable for disabled people; a history of miscommunication with the player base, and so many other instances that show us they just don't care as long as you're buying their cosmetics. last year a broken interaction prompt held back friendship questlines with 3 NPCs whose friendships are connected for /three months/ while they kept silent about it.

also and hey, if you're starting this game from steam, they won't tell you, but you /have/ to create a palia.com account when given the chance. trust me. the first time you boot this game you'll want to add your email when the popup shows and you're gonna wanna go to palia.com and try to 'recover your password' to actually create a password, because you /are/ going to have bugs you'll want to report and you /will/ need a palia.com account to do it. but they won't tell you. so i will ✨

-
anyways 3/10 because i actually think this game is pretty and relaxing, and it /can/ go places!.. but not until S6 decides to do it.</p>

      <p>The game was a lot of fun at launch despite being riddled with bugs but as the year came to a close the game changed to quantity over quality. No real content being pushed out hardly ever most updates showcase cosmetics that cost a lot of real money. Rinse and repeated events that barely changed from last season and don't work. After reaching endgame there isn't much of a point in playing. The housing item cap is still 3000 the storage hasn't been increased. Just overall a huge letdown and disappointment especially after enjoying the game for many many hours. Just sad and disappointing I had real hopes for this game</p>

      <p>Game has potential, however, there are too many odd game mechanics that make less sense than real life itself. Your efforts and time isn't respected.

Farming crops will not grow unless you're repeatedly logging in.
Equipment that you've spend time and resources upgrading, reverts back to its previous form because durability reaches zero (quickly).
Repair system gated behind a profession unrelated to other professions that require repairing system. No tutorial for a public repair (if it exists).</p>

      <p>So. Maybe this is on me, but the trailer and description made it seem like it was a coop adventure/village builder, but it reminds me more of Toontown than anything. There are plenty of good aspects, but they are small compared to the much larger inadequacies of the game.

Gameplay: 1/5 - I can see the potential, but there is just no substance. In the early stages you have to wait for hours to build a house because the crafting time in some of your machines are so slow. Farming/gardening is...boring - there is nothing to do. Hunting seems pointless because you can buy everything from a store (thankfully!). The housing plot is ultimately limited in space. The missions have you run around the two large maps JUST to talk to villagers or buy one recipe. Oh, and to return to your housing plot? You either can run all the way back or wait for the 10 minute timer to automatically teleport back. If you teleport, there is a queue so your wait time may be longer.

Graphics: 4/5 - The game is very pretty and cozy. Im sure if you can suffer through the grind of actually building a big decorated house, the game would be astonishingly peaceful. Though, outside the housing plot and the main village(s) there really isnt anything worth looking at. 

Soundtrack: 5/5 - I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Its adventurous and inspiring. 

Overall: 2/5 - There is something underneath all the grinding you need to do. Im sure eventually the game is all it seems to be - a peaceful home decorating/designing game where you can unleash your creativity and see how your friends build. But to get there...well, it isnt fun. If there was more survival, adventuring, an actual open world, and simply more in depth systems, this game could transform into something great where you can survive and build with friends! But if those arent in the roadmap, thats okay, I'll take my time elsewhere!</p>

      <p>For a game with the multiplayer tag, it doesn't actually do anything with it. You very rarely interact with other players to complete content and it feels more like a solo game with co-op elements once in a blue moon. I didn't really feel invested to keep playing after a couple hours. The world itself felt small and empty, with each map having a hard lock of only 25 players in a zone. This game has yet to be fully released, despite no longer being marked as Early access, so maybe that's the reason why it feels like it's missing something to keep up engagement.

The characters seemed fine, I liked some more than others but unless I invest some serious grind time into the game I can't say for sure if I have any favourites beyond what they look like. Unfortunately, the game play loop doesn't really feel engaging enough to sink hours into it, and I was left wondering what all my progress was for aside from building furniture and decorating my space. While what's there already is much more in depth than the majority of games you'll see with similar mechanics, it's hard to build a game around that being the only selling point. 

Not to mention given that the game is free to play, the developers have stated that the cash shop is their only means of funding the game. While I'm not condemning the presence of the cash shop (as it's a necessary mechanic for ftp games to exist) it does mean that updating the premium cash options take priority over content updates and the items within are very expensive for what they are. There's also no way for free players to gain new outfits or farm the cash shop currency through the game which creates a class system of free players vs cash shop whales and divides the player base (however unintentionally). This also makes Jel, one of the few npc's I was curious about, just a mouthpiece to try and bring you into the premium cash shop. His store is completely devoid of items for players to buy, his comments about having new stock and new designs feel like the devs advertising to players rather than Jel himself, and his store register only opens the cash shop menu, rather than an in game merchant menu like the others. While the cash shop isn't intrusive by any means, knowing that there's no way to customise my character and make them unique outside of spending real life money left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>

      <p>This is a nice game. And it is refreshing having a MMORG that doesn't include PvP or violence in general. But you quickly run out of content. Needs a lot more work and more quests to be good.</p>

      <p>Ignore play time, I've played this game off steam since it first came out.
This game actually originally launched in 2023 only for other cozy games released in full versions the same year to completely overshadow it. Gameplay feel is very primitive like you are playing a PS2/Xbox/Wii game. They haven't bothered updating the main story in a year while being in early access for 2 years. Also the premium store is like 10 pages long with basic outfits costing 40 dollars, please make it make sense. Community is still riddled with toxic positivity and will jump on you if you have any critiques of their comfort game. They added a mechanic to let you grow rare resources at your in-game home but people will still curse you out for chopping the tree that they and their friends were claiming.</p>

      <p>I used to really love Palia, especially because it's free to play and seemed extremely player rich. I enjoyed the game for a few months and even spent quite a bit of cash on it to support the devs, but then things began to get worse over time. Here are my main issues with the game:

The romance options are great and they have even opened up some new candidates over time per the players requests, but you never actually get to go on an of the dates with any of the characters. They always find some excuse and then you end up running around doing a minor quest to help them out and make them like you more. This happens with every single candidate, and you never really get to do anything out of the usual. It's a little disheartening considering part of the cozy aspect of the game is to date/romance characters. I found it to be extremely disappointing.

The glitches were something that were always present, but as time went on and promises of fixing them, they only seemed to get worse. More and more bugs cropped up, lots of them being the exact same issue from a previous patch that they swore they fixed. This leads to the game being unplayable, as certain quests and weekly gifts are cooked meals and when an ingredient is glitching or something isn't working, you can't complete it and essentially have to wait for the developers to fix it. Usually, I am very patient about this, but the issue is that the bugs aren't being fixed at all. They claim they are, but never seem to fix anything that is a real problem. This leads me to my biggest gripe about Palia and it is the way that the developers are deciding to handle the criticism of their inconsistencies. When told about triggering seizures due to the glitching, their response was that they were going to fix it asap due to concern for their player base. When they essentially told these players they fixed the issue, and very obviously didn't, they were politely confronted only to get upset and tell players to "give them the benefit of the doubt" in spite of their previous promises to actually fix the issue. I find that to be irresponsible, and frankly untrustworthy when they could just be upfront about their struggles to fix visual settings or toggle to turn off the visuals that will cause these seizures.

Overall, I wouldn't say it's a terrible game, but I personally cannot support devs who do not care about their player base and continue to act unprofessional in the face of problems they themselves have created. If I could go back and never put any money into the game, I would in a heartbeat as things are far too expensive for a game that doesn't actively fix bugs and in-game issues that make it unplayable from week to week. I may reconsider in the future if they ever address their poor communication with people in the disabled community and their lack of bug fixes, but otherwise, I have to be upfront about my experience and it wasn't good.</p>

      <p>Free version of Disney Dreamlight Valley. As much as I wanted to play DDLV, but Disney didn't keep their promise, and didn't make it free to play after release, so I was looking for something free / cheaper to play. This game fulfills that scratch you need. Look, I don't even mind grinding part, I love grinding in most games if it is done right. What I don't like in games is that a singleplayer game / singleplayer-ish game forces you to play with others in order to get materials you need for your solo play. Let me just play solo, and I would have given positive review.</p>

      <p>Severely lacks co-operative opportunities despite being an always online game. It's a singleplayer game that requires you to always be connected and seeing other players. Adding dungeons or combat would be a good way to introduce a cooperative activity. Otherwise co-op in here is you and your friends building your own sandcastles.</p>

      <p>Very comffy and cozy. I especially liked the fishing minigame, its unlike anything i've ever played before! very interactive. all of the systems feel rewarding and fun. Gathering materials doesnt feel like a chore. Theres so much to do, even when you have to wait around for ores to smelt or wood to cut, you can go play minigames in the sewers or befriend the villagers. 
The concept of hunting bugs and animals is really neat as well. Most games will have you fighting monsters or running for your life. But here, theres no danger. The game goes as fast as you want it to, and theres no rush to do anything. its just a nice casual place to be. 
I just finished building my first house and now I can't wait to do all the customizations. Building furniture and learning new recipes whilst doing so is a great concept to be implemented. I look forward to where Palia takes me!</p>

      <p>This is an awesome little game. I can't believe its free right now. 
The characters are cute, their clothes are stylish and the landscape is plenty engaging.
However, it being multiplayer, my server doesn't have many players right now, or at
least when I'm playing, and so it feels quite empty. But, the game's visuals are really beautiful,
and the game playing is fun. I can relax playing this game too, which is a plus for me. I don't always want to be fighting monsters, and other creatures. I like having a game I can just relax into, and enjoy some fun exploring, crafting, building and other such activities. I'm looking forward to what else gets added to this game in the future.</p>

      <p>I can't believe this game is free to play. I've spent over 100 hours on it. Yes, you have to grind levels and materials, but if you didn't have to, it'd be boring because you'd have your farm and house immediately. It feels like there is more payoff when you level up and earn different recipes or items for purchase. There are little nuances to the crafting and while it might seem annoying, I ended up liking how they work. The game is a bit buggy, but it's free and clearly made with love. I bought some outfits in the cash store because wow they are adorable and I wanted to support the game.The NPCs are so cute! I really enjoy getting to know all of them and progress their relationships. The romances are very sweet too! I like that the game makes you work with other players because I'm very shy and I've slowly gotten used to speaking to people on the server to let them know what resources I've found. Give this one a chance and take your time. Put headphones on to really enjoy all the ambient sounds.</p>

      <p>It's good - still very much a work in progress, but it's good. Still some bugs - the compass does not always play nicely with quest markers, and it has such terrible controller support that, despite allowing cross platform play, it's completely unusable on the Switch for many people, including my friends that I'd like to play with.

But it's a neat mix of cozy game formulas that keep me coming back, and it's not punishing at all, so it doesn't feel like a drag. For a free game, it's worth it, and I haven't noticed any pay-to-win mechanics yet even though I'm about halfway through most of the skills. The in-game community seems very nice too, it's an MMO that encourages cooperation and even friendliness in the loading screen flavor text, and that seems to be working out well.</p>

      <p>Fun game. Lots to do, big maps, even when you play alone you're not alone. Easy to work with others or just do your own thing. Lots of different ways to play. Music is delightful, characters feel fleshed out (which is impressive for the number of NPCs), graphics are pretty great. A little buggy (NPCs sink into the ground only to pop up to normal a few steps later and can't be interacted with while on bridges) but nothing game-breaking. I've been playing with my husband and we haven't had any difficulties. The Party Bonus is also a nice touch, and you can always see where your party members are if you're in the same server. For a free game, this is a ridiculously good game. You don't HAVE to spend real world money if you don't want to, anyone who says otherwise is just easily jealous/wants the extra pretty things. These developers need money somehow, and for a free game, the prices are reasonable and - again - optional. Highly enjoyable game and quickly becoming my favorite new game.</p>

      <p>Palia has charmed me with its delightful characters and engaging dialogue. The gameplay loop, while not groundbreaking, offers a relaxing and cozy experience with a focus on decorating and building your dream .. farm home, I guess. While the repetitive nature can set in after a while, the game provides a variety of activities to keep you engaged, from fishing and bug catching to gardening and interior design.

One divisive aspect is the cooperative harvesting of higher-tier materials. This encourages social interaction and teamwork, adding a refreshing layer to the gameplay. However, solo players might find this mechanic a bit limiting at times.

Overall, Palia is a fun and charming game that delivers on its promise of a cozy and relaxing experience. Despite some minor drawbacks, I recommend giving it a try, especially if you like a good cozy vibe game and decorating a home.</p>

      <p>This game isn’t really for solo players looking to just kick back and play on their own — it’s much more rewarding when you have support from friends. There are plenty of items and tasks that require two or more people, so if you’re going it alone, it'll be impossible to progress the main quest after the first few. However, if you’re someone who loves being part of communities, joining Discord servers, and making new friends, this is the game for you! You don't need your current friend group to play it with, there's sooo many discord servers and people wanting to make friends. If you don't necessarily want to make friends, you can still message in server chat your coordinates on the map and someone will come by and help you farm items you can't do alone, or you can request 4 items per day that you need and people will fulfil your request.

It’s hands down the cosiest, no-combat game I’ve ever played. The quests aren’t overly challenging but still enjoyable, and there’s always something to do, from cute events to decorating and designing your housing plot. Even though I’m usually not a fan of farming games, this one is super fun and easy to get into. You don't have to worry about fall damage, villagers sleeping (even though they sleep you can still go to their door and speak to them!). There's not much you can't do, it's still a grind, not an easy run, but an enjoyable one!

That being said, there are still a fair number of bugs, like items in buildings sometimes becoming invisible or villagers appearing underground at your plot, which can be a bit annoying. You’ll likely need to restart the game to fix these issues. But it’s still a fairly new game, so I’m sure these bugs will be ironed out over time and don't really take away from the experience as they're quite minor. 

One thing I’d love to see in the future is a shop for different hairstyles to make character customisation a bit more detailed. I’m a big fan of character creation, so more options to customise your avatar would be a great addition!

What really stands out, though, is the community. I’ve joined 'cooking parties' in game from Discord, which help level up your cooking skill and earn money in the game super fast. The people are incredibly kind, helpful, and generous. It’s honestly one of the best gaming communities I’ve been a part of. If you’re into making friends and love a chill, cosy vibe, this game will become your new favourite! 

*TL;DR*: Great game for those who enjoy teamwork and community! Solo players may struggle past the early quests, but there are plenty of Discord servers to make friends and get help. It’s a cosy, no-combat game with fun quests and relaxing housing design. Some bugs like invisible items and villagers underground exist, but they’re minor and likely to be fixed. A character customisation shop for hairstyles would be a great addition. The community is friendly and helpful, making it perfect for those who love a chill, social vibe!</p>

      <p>Palia is a fun and entertaining cozy game suitable for all ages. It has some downsides due to being a new game like graphics glitches and the game does crash from time to time likely due to overloaded servers and the like. I'm sure things like this once the game is fully finished. overall I do enjoy the game and easily logged nearly 70 hours of gameplay before finding i was running out of things to do.</p>

It definitely still has bugs, I do wish they would spend more time on fixing those instead of adding more cosmetics into the shop. I also wish they had more free cosmetics instead of having to pay 20-36 dollars for them. Other than that I think it's worth playing if you like Stardew Valley and/or Grounded.</p>

      <p>A game that you can easily hyper-fixate on. A no life kind of completionist game. Its a combination of Disney Dream Light Valley and Harvest Moon 64 (which is the best). There is no combat! The community is not toxic and are rather enjoyable. If this was a points system id give it 100 thats how much I like it. The level of achievements is Hogwarts lvl.</p>

      <p>A joyous online farming/crafting sim that is relaxing, entertaining, and beautiful. 
Key features:
1) Co-op. You can choose to travel alone, but it is more worth while with friends. So far the community is supportive and kind.
2) Story. I have yet to finish the main story, but it has been entertaining.
3) Characters. Diverse and interesting with their own personalities. Work to befriend them with gifts, daily chats, and quests. Romance available.
4)Skill growth. The skill growth spans several areas: farming, hunting, mining, crafting, fishing. It keeps you moving and sets reasonable goals.
5) Farming. The farming sim is reliable and easy, yet with challenges that get easier as you level up your equipment and skill. Plenty of plants to offer, and the upgrades are worth it.
6) Fishing and bug catching. Easy with it's own challenges. A wide array of fish and bugs that vary depending on location, time, and equipment. You can display star quality ones in your home.
7) Foraging, hunting, and mining. Similar to other games with a rarity level and the equipment to match. Tools become available to help ease the process, and friends make it easier.
8) Cooking and crafting. Unlock an array of recipes as well as equipment to keep your focus up (your energy so to speak that impacts the exp earned). Cooking with a group proves more rewarding.
9) Build your house and share with others. You buy writs and crafter rights at the town hall to expand your home. Set your home in a tour for others to see and view and rate other homes. Doing all of this gains you rewards. The building mechanism is good, but could use improvements. You can buy house expansions from the town hall, and additional buildings. Easily moved. You can purchase recipes for building blocks to build, and these lock together for easy movement. You can grow trees and flowers to place, and, as noted earlier, you can place tanks with bugs and fish! See cons for minor irritants.
10) Customize your character with clothing, hairstyles, hats, and pets. The character customization is easy and seamless. 

Palia is free, though there are in-game purchases you can make to support them.

Cons (my personal take):
1) Probably one of my largest annoyances is the inability to group move many items on your plot. You can work around this by stacking on movable items, but if you want to plant a ton of flowers in grass? You had better want them where they are!
2) Glitches. Some of the glitches can be annoying and frustrating, but overall they are few and the devs are active in corrections.
3) Night doesn't get dark enough in my opinion. I know it's silly, but I like the challenge of creating light.
4) Although I appreciate the no time limit, not resting for energy seems...odd. Almost like cheating.
5) Interaction with pets. I mean, they are cute, but that's it. Nothing but following you around. I would like to see at the minimum petting interaction! Skills and leveling would be great!
6) No mounts. But there is a cart system. Yet there is a lot of running around.
7) No weather changes. I always appreciate this in farming Sims, but also can add additional challenges.

I highly recommend this game, and if you enjoy it ass well as I do, then remember to support the dev team. <3</p>

      <p>Really enjoying this game! Love the graphics, characters and quests. 
You do have to do ALOT of grinding in this game to gather materials for building items/furniture and to fulfil characters requests. 
It also takes a while to earn money in this game, which you will need to buy recipes to upgrade equipment. So if you don't mind the grind then I would say it's a fun game to chill and pass the time with.</p>

      <p>Very relaxing gathering and building game. The only downsides are 1) not a lot of gameplay variety outside of gathering and decorating (personally I don't mind but someone else might) and 2) paywalled cosmetics, notably home settings and new clothes, which you can't craft or earn.</p>

      <p>Such a cute, cozy game with an interesting story. There's also a variety of things to do while waiting for about half an hour for a medium room to be completed or 5 minutes for 1 iron bar. Chopping trees could be an option but keep an eye out for random bugs and even wolves that spawn from the ground! true magic! Also i get it, its a free game but the prices on the cosmetics are ridiculous. This game could be so good if it needed less grind and then you would be able to actually enjoy the story. Still gonna recommend this though because it has potential. ^^</p>

      <p>Palia is a free to play game that is everything you could ever want in a cozy life sim! It super fun to run around and meet all the interesting characters while following along a fun and intriguing plot. In the meantime while you complete the story you get to build a home base and learn to cook, garden/farm, fish, etc.. So many fun things! You also get to play with people all over the world and everyone is so nice and helpful when you are out getting resources. The creators are very generous and are always working to update the game as well as sending out little free gifts to players. The only time you spend real life money is if you want any special outfits/skins/pets but even those are very reasonable seeing how the game is free and that is how they keep the lights on. If you don’t want to spend money they do give you a free pet and most f the clothing is actually really cute! There are tons of great videos on YouTube as well on how to get started in Palia like the lingo and “unspoken rules” of the game so when I started, I was feeling pretty comfortable but greeted and helped by all the players and even still to this day am.  I get lost in this game for hours and highly recommend it!</p>

      <p>First of all, I've put A LOT of time into this game. The character quests are fine, but the Main Quests are absolutely ridiculous. The level of difficulty of them are FAR BEYOND the limits of what is enjoyable in a relaxing, casual game. I feel like I'm playing Myst, attempting to do all these puzzles. I'd love to just ignore these quests, but it unlocks other quests. SO, SO frustrating that I may stop playing. Please figure out a way to fix this.... I see in the statistics for these quests that only 2% of players have completed them. It's out of balance.

I think this game could be amazing if the Main Quest issue is fixed. No one wants a game that it too hard to play.</p>

      <p>F2P multiplayer, not buying the expensive cash shop items doesn't dampen the overall experience. If you want a casual, slightly grindy (if you're competitive) and no-pressure game of farming and rich NPC interactions, go for a try or two. 
There are events throughout the year so maybe play during those timings for different experiences. Personally, I only play to escape from the stress of work and commitments.
It's also available on Switch, which you can play on the same account. Have fun if you can!</p>

      <p>I love this game, but I nearly didn't play it. There are a lot of complaints on the reviews section & in some player forums which made me think that it might be sub standard. I think it is a great game, for those who like animal crossing or medieval dynasty. It has had so much effort and time put in, & the amount of options for decorating are incredible. To the complaints I would only say this- the game is free! I would pay $40- $50 for it (I am used to PlayStation & Nintendo prices). In fact I spent money on skins because I felt so guilty not paying anything for the experience. 
What I love:
The number of options for furniture/decorations.
The number of different plant-ables (flowers).
The monthly markets.
The NPC storylines are great (the Subira ones worried me a bit, but they turned out well).
I like that they add new plots & new areas, some of the other games I have played kind of end & having fresh content means I can play for longer.

What I would alter:
I would love to see what is in Tamala's store & have potions.
I like having symmetry in my veggie patch, please add another soil slot, or have say 8 veggie/berry slots & then when you hit higher levels allow 2-4 "tree only"soil plots.
I find it weird that the apple tree "dies", it would be better that it is planted once on a "tree only slot"and then just gives apples every 5-8 days rather than having to keep replanting it.

What I would add:
I would love an extra colour option in the furniture makeovers (something like black/white/wooden look). 
I would like some long skirts, there are a lot of short skirts and jeans etc.

Think it is great, full credit to the devs for this :).</p>

      <p>After putting over a hundred hours in-game I feel it is well thought out, original and fun. I would like to commend the developers for a job well done. With that being said the amount of bugs in game is ridiculous and to make matters worse they are all game breaking. Having your tools stop working just a couple minutes into the grind makes the game nearly pointless. I suppose you can walk around and do nothing, but who does that? Who wants to do that as a game?</p>

      <p>1. I love the story line and personal quests to increase relationship with each character. Every character has a unique and charming personality.

2. No time restraint. I love this feature! I used to stress getting everything done in Stardew Valley but this removes that stress. Don't get me wrong, I love the grind in Stardew but Palia is definitely a lot more laid back.

[h3]PARTY UP![/h3] 
3. Just send a server-wide message and someone will take you up on it. It is so much faster to farm because being in a party allows you access to each other's loot as long as you stay in close proximity of each other. This includes ores, foraging, hunting, etc. You gain money faster which will help you buy the bigger backpack and ammo storage.

4. I love the community and how all players support each other. There is a donation system where each player can ask everyone in the server up to 4 items per day. 

Thank you devs!!</p>

      <p>This game reminds me of those resource collecting phone games. The ones you have to grind for and then get the resources to build. Has alot of the systems from those games just with better graphics. Don't expect dungeons or fighting at least right now. 
With that said it's a good game for people who just want a world to live in where they can do daily mundane tasks. I can see that this game takes inspiration from game mechanics like fable and zelda. Like romance options, climbing rock faces and mysterious lore that can be discovered.</p>

      <p>its in beta so still a bit buggy here n there, even more so on the switch. that aside pros n cons are as followed

CONS: i cant romance elouisa and that should be a crime. S6 plz fix this in future update.

PROS: its basically a more interactive animal crossing. crafting, farming, cooking, hunting, fishing, foraging, everything super chill. even when ur tools break u dont lose em, they just downgrade to base level which cant break. honestly the social aspect breeds a very calming community where anyone in the sever can help u complete quests or even co-op farm. best part is a switch player can play with pc player and unlike some animal crossing like games (cough cough, dreamlight valley) the game doesnt break when your friends visit. 

genuinely charming NPCs many of which u can romance, are fun to talk to and make most fetch quests fun. also props for a fun cooking mechanic and fishing mechanics that arent boring or stressful.

heck even when u Inevitably hit a wall and have to start grinding, it aint that bad for the most part. 
all-in-all really fun and my newest addiction</p>

      <p>I like this game because there's no fighting other players, you can skill levels up  growing food , Hunting, fishing, mining, bug collecting any starred bug or fish can easily be put in a tank and displayed in your home plot. Wood chopping and plant gathering.  It's an amazing colourful world which I love travelling round sometimes just looking. I have limited mobility so really enjoy taken the time going round this colourful world, The MPCS in the game are very well done, just love  Zeki  and even moany Hassian  I find it a very pleasant people game, I cannot read the chat in game, but it hasn't spoilt my enjoyment of the game, well done to all who helped making the game and I'm looking forward to Elderwoods, what will we discover in there.</p>

      <p>The game had a lot of potential on release but its been squandered. New content only contains weak additions with the entire focus being on getting more money out of its players. Latest update as of writing this for example, adds a few decorations for F2P and then barrages you with paid only items and a FOMO paid login rewards program. On release this game had everything it could ask for, only for them to get greedy, fire half their workforce and demand its customers foot the bill. Disrespectful and common in this industry nowadays.

      <p>I REALLY wanted to like this game but:
the tutorial alone ( ~2 hours of buttonmashing ) is not only way too long, no; you have to do everything in exactly the order the devs want you to, so you can't even take the most efficient route.
also; some tutorials are hidden until you unlock them, but you still need them as prerequisites for other tutorials,
QuestNPCS just don't spawn sometimes; making progress literally impossible

also poorly optimised, if at all, super laggy without apperant reasons ( my rig is more than good enough )

      <p>Me and my girlfriend love this game but i only ask that they make this more controller friendly,
there are a decent amount of actions in game that don't have a button icon and it makes it very difficult 
to figure out without having to press every button on the controller. That aside the game is very fun and fairly well optimized for lowend hardware.</p>

      <p>really chill, no risk kind of game. An orpg with plenty of room to either do things on your own or in a party or group. updates are common and a new area is planned to open soon! there's a lot of groups on many social media platforms for conversation and advice so even while playing alone, there is always a community.</p>

      <p>Palia is a fresh new game concept I have not found before. I have played something similar in the past with the Animal Crossing series but Palia is still much more fascinating. I like that the community is a safe space where you can mine, build, connect with NPC's and not feel like you are being timed to do all the things in one day or time period. There are mental health queues that are small reminder messages in loading screens that make me feel like this is a safe space for people of all ages and mental capacities.</p>

      <p>I love playing Palia - I broke my femur and have to rest my leg periodically - so easy to pick up the Switch and play for an hour or two, or three or four!! My dad plays too and he is 85; my daughter of 24 also plays, so it's a game which obviously has something for every age group. 
The downside is that when there is a new patch, problems arise with things that weren't issues before. Having spent the majority of my working life in software design and production, I would hazard a guess that the software is not written in modules which are untouched once proven to work.  So, there is room for improvement and the issues can be frustrating, but it is still the best game I have played to date.</p>

More open world events and fun things to chase love when you find all sort of activities in an world 
i love the underground activities add more please hot pot is fun (Race - fights - card collecting - ..)

      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-24)</h4>
      <p>Despite almost 400 hours in the game, unless you're only here for decorating your plot, the game isn't worth too much of your time. I love the building system, the style of the objects, the grid system, etc. The characters are well written, but dialogue becomes cycled fairly quickly with very little updates to their story-lines/personal development. 

I play on PC, but the graphics for Switch are ATROCIOUS not to mention the bugs!! In my opinion, it's not ready for early access even after almost a year of being playable on steam. Every update breaks the game to the point where it's unplayable.

 There's still quests that are so bugged, you can't get through them without contacting support and yet they keep adding expensive cosmetics to the game. How many $20 dollar outfits does this game need before it fixes core issues? I have no problem with cosmetics, but it's bordering on EA levels of over-monetization for a game that isn't worth the money. The free clothing options are ugly as hell, ad the cosmetics are overpriced. The dwindling player count speaks for itself honestly. I love this game and the little world of Palia but mismanagement and greed ruin it for me. I'll still log in to decorate here and there but I'm not invested like I was when I first started playing and that's unlikely to change.</p>

      <p>This game is good and bad as it stands, it teeters from being a fun farming sim MMO that holds your attention and lets you decorate to the endless Sisyphean task that is repairs... I kind of like this game I just wish that upgrading didn't feel like downgrading, and lord are there bugs this game is Skyrim level spaghetti code so as of now I can't really recommend it without a lot of things being addressed by the Devs</p>

      <p>It's a cute RPG with a rather interesting story line. I love that humans are considered almost mythical and here your character pops up out of nowhere and the entire community of non humans is so curious about your character. The only thing that's meh about this game is the grind for materials. The crafting is amazing, gathering the materials, especially the more rare ones is tedious, especially when it's a 5:1 or better ratio. Also the interaction/friendship aspect goes a little slowly. It's almost like you can grind the friendships to get them to where you need them for certain quests, or you can grind materials...there doesn't feel like there's a good balance there yet. Overall though, a nice game, good for when you want to get into a game and lose track of time but easily enough to stop where you're at and come back to reality.</p>

Has some bugs and issues but overall for a free to play game it’s something I’d recommend to fans of these kind of games I def enjoyed my time playing on the switch and I will say it performs bunch better on pc so definitely if you have this option over switch try it on pc</p>

      <p>Loved playing the game so far, grinding is a bit much at lower levels. I love these types of games and why I played Disney Dreamland but waiting to meet different villagers and unlock different things gives me a little sour taste. One thing I really enjoy about the game is the character creation however. I will give it a 5/10 just because every outfit is 20+ dollars. An MMORPG like FF, BDO, WoW or anything like I can see since the playerbase is so massive. But for a mainly singleplayer game its a bit much. I get its a new game and the devs are trying to build the community and such which takes a huge amount of money; but to have the most boring clothing and all the nice clothing purchasable is killer to me. Why not make some pieces of clothing craftable or obtainable through certain missions?</p>

      <p>I love this game!!! Id highly recommend this game to others, in fact I have. Character creation is really good, the in game relationship system is a favorite, I love the resource gathering aspect of it, inventory/map/quest log etc are all easy to navigate which is great. I love the different areas you can explore and all the little achievements you can get playing.
For the things I dislike starting off with 1. Storage. Stacked items take up way more space then I was expecting. Rather then a stack of 20 wood taking 1 spot in your storage chest it is actually taking up 20 of your spots even when stacked/condensed which gets really annoying when you're trying to build up your resources. 
2. Crafting items feels super unbalanced in the way that each item requires a ton of resources which is a lot of time gathering, time refining, storage space all for one item. Some crafted items also just feel pointless. For example, you can craft repair kits for your tools when you upgrade them to keep them at max power. Each crafted kit gives you 20 kits which I assumed 1 kit = full tool life. WRONG. If your tool is nearing the end of its upgraded life its going to cost all if not more then your 20 kits to fix which feels insanely unbalanced. Makes "upgrading" your tools feel more like a "downgrade" and an expensive chore to keep up on.</p>

      <p>Still relatively new to the game with only around 230 hours at the time of this review. The game is still being developed with updates being implemented.

This game is not designed to rush from the start to end, someone can min/max, stress to hit every event and rush all the time to try and squeeze in every aspect of the game each time it comes around but that was not what it was designed for.  This is a cozy game which is focused on a relaxing game-play. An in-game date is matched to a real world hour.  So if you miss something you can just get it again an hour later.  The day cycles are not designed to be a FOMO, just to allow a variety of events to take place throughout the in-game day such as rotating fish or bugs during select hours as well as NPC's go about their lives and work, socialize and sleep too.  The designer of Palia included that you can still interact with the NPC's even if they are sleeping at time so your never really missing out. 

Some peoples comments that they feel that gold becomes the bottleneck to slow down play and that is somewhat true.  It is more difficult in the beginning to earn gold as you are learning the game, improving your tools, expanding your housing plot(s) and more. If you mainly want to just unlock things you can focus on the main quest line. If your not in a rush however there are side quests, discoverables, story lines that expand the games lore and flushes out the NPCs. Just about any game has progression to keep the game moving and interesting.  This is a free game with the option to purchase cosmetics if you opt to do so but it is by no means required. In general the community has been positive, helpful and considerate to events working as groups.  The game rewards playing together but does not takeaway from playing solo if you have a preference game play style.</p>

      <p>Very cute and fun slice of life game. Rather enjoy it and I love the decorating process.

Only complaint(s) I'd have:
1. The drop rate of trees from the guldor statue for flow seedlings... one every 24 hours is a little harsh when you're working on a big project that has those designs in place. I have yet to get all 4 flow seeds and i have been trying for 2 months now. 

2. The decoration limit of 3k. I know they're working on that, so I hope to see more in the future as a LOT of the items offered are small, which means you can use a lot of them</p>

You can decorate your plot, hunt with friends, or go to the black market to play hotpot with new friends. The game is still in development, so be patient with the quirks, but most importantly let the devs know by reporting, they are very receptive to feedback from their players.

      <p>For a free game in beta, this is extremely impressive. I almost feel overwhelmed by how much there is to do. I'm nowhere near done with the main story, and apparently only the Prologue has been completed thus far?? All the money I spent on Disney Dreamlight Valley should have gone to this one. I actually feel enthusiastic about supporting this game, financially, as I really want the development to continue. As an unmotivated ADHDer, Palia makes me passionate about video games again.</p>

      <p>Its a fun game, does feel little designed for girls since most of the cosmetics are dresses but as a guy its a fun, peaceful game. Still very early stages since its beta for PC, so lots of quality of life changes that can be made by the devs that have yet to be made.</p>

      <p>Overall an enjoyable casual game, with a Stardew Valley meets Animal Crossing feel.
After the initial storyline section, the game will keep you relaxedly occupied and running around, grinding to make in-game money to enjoy making and running your farm/workshop,
There's optional microtransaction cosmetics which isn't overly in your face and pressuring for you to get.</p>

      <p>Warning: Palia is incredibly addictive! 

As someone who’s experienced the toxicity in many online games, Palia has been a breath of fresh air. The game offers a welcoming, positive community where players are genuinely helpful and supportive. I believe the developers' main goal is to create a space where creativity can thrive and players can collaborate freely.

I absolutely love the game's depth. From building your own house to farming, cooking, and crafting, every activity contributes to your skill progression. There's so much to explore and enjoy that it's hard to know where to begin!

That being said, the game isn’t perfect. My only criticism is the chat function, which tends to bug me out of the game from time to time. Additionally, the Mujins look a bit off when you're cutting down trees, but these small issues don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

Palia is a charming and immersive experience that stands out in a crowded genre. I can't recommend it enough!</p>

      <p>Heard about and randomly saw it. Long story short I and two of my friends have been playing for over five hours now. You're not pressured to finish quests or meet everyone as you eventually do. The graphics are amazing in the not overly bright or out of place for the world. I'm thoroughly enjoying the beta and can't wait for full release.

My only complaint are the large text for the quest list as it could be smaller to pin more quest if that is update. My other one is that the world chat is way to big and makes staying in the zone a bit hard for me.</p>

      <p>Still early in game life, nice builder and relaxing game play. No skins for free to play and it can be annoying running around looking for rarer materials (until you hit higher craft levels) Otherwise its a nice relaxing, slow paced game with loads and loads of building options. Just a bit messy atm, but has potential to be a gem.</p>

      <p>Only good thing about this is fishing. Super simple. 
However, with the overly added popups of "information" it literally tells you nothing of what to do. How do I get I fabric or leather? How do I get back to my quest marker that's no longer there because I reached the place but had to go back for something? Why can I not fast travel to places I've already been? Why the eff do I need to arc my arrow to shoot something literally 5 feet in front of me? 
I really did not enjoy this game. It annoyed and frustrated me more than anything. As someone who greatly enjoys fishing, farming and the such, this game was honestly a waste of my time.</p>

      <p>Its a free to play cozy game that still has adventure, while you don't go killing monsters (not that I would mind killing monsters) there are still challenges, quests, and adventures. Palia is in a category of its own. You can design your own house and decorate how you want in whatever style you choose. You can make food, farm, hunt, fish, and even friend and date npcs. I was never interested in stardew valley or animal crossing. I don't really play cozy games but I must say Palia is a vibe. 

That being said while I do like the game and its lore a lot I do not like the co-op aspect in that you are required to work with others for certain resources. Its hard for me to talk to others one on one and/or ask for help when most people don't even talk in chat, just because someone is helpful doesn't mean they want to be friends. Don't get me wrong some talk and seem friendly and if you ask a question you're likely to receive an answer but I also feel like I'm on someone else's time when in a group unless I know the people well. I don't want to rush because someone is waiting and I don't want to make others feel rushed because I'm waiting. And some days its just hard to ask for help. It's not that I'm anti social you'll see me talk in chat its more that I'm awkward social and don't want to feel forced to make friends.

There's unique crafting in the game as well but I wish used items you no longer want had a better use than to just be tossed, maybe like a revert system, even if you lose some materials, or a lower sell price, auctioning even. 

Also, it would be neat if you could design or even craft cosmetics or outfits though I'm not sure that's a thing. (Still learning things) You can change your look and beginner outfit for free and as often as you want but there's nothing else unless you buy it which I get, they gotta make money to run the game somehow, but I wouldn't mind a few pieces of craftable clothing and cosmetics here and there. I feel like I don't have a personality because there's nothing on my person that's unique lol

All in all very good game would recommend 8/10. (Yes I got it for free but it is free at least for now.)</p>

      <p>I LOVE Palia! I can't believe I've played this simple game more hours than I've played Baldur's Gate III. Some days you want something to play where you know you can relax and nothing's going to try to kill you. It's fun doing the friendship/dating quests. I like that there are secrets to unravel, plenty of things to craft and collect. Decorating your home is fun. The game's genuinely free, they don't bug you to buy stuff all the time but I ended up buying a few cosmetic things just because I love the game so much and wanted to support them. I see plenty of ways the game could improve but it gets a lot right and I look forward to what they do in the future.</p>

      <p>Palia is a charming life sim with a lot of potential. The world is visually stunning, and the character customization options are extensive. I've enjoyed exploring the different areas, completing quests, and interacting with the friendly villagers.

One of the highlights is the in-depth decorating system. Players have a lot of freedom to customize their homes with a wide variety of furniture, decorations, and even landscaping options. This allows for a high level of creativity and personalization.

However, some aspects of the game can be frustrating. Collecting certain plushies, particularly the rare fish and hunting ones, can be quite challenging and time-consuming. The drop rates for these items seem low, which can be discouraging.

Overall, Palia is a promising game with a lot to offer. The charming world, engaging characters, and extensive customization options make it a relaxing and enjoyable experience. However, some aspects, like the difficulty of obtaining certain collectibles, could be improved.

Key Strengths:

Beautiful visuals and a charming world.
Extensive character customization options.
Engaging decorating system with a wide range of furniture and decor.
Friendly and engaging NPCs.
Areas for Improvement:

Difficulty of obtaining certain plushies, particularly fish and hunting ones.
Some aspects of the game can feel repetitive.
Overall:

Palia is a fun and relaxing life sim with a lot of potential. Despite some minor drawbacks, it's a game that I've enjoyed playing and look forward to seeing how it evolves in the future.

      <p>I really enjoy the low stress environment of this game. No urging you to water and harvest crops every twenty minutes. If you take a week off, it will still be there when you get back. nothing dies if it doesn't get watered.
Also, you don't die if you fall in the water, walk off the edge of a cliff, etc. You just repopulate where you were last in a safe spot. Got a mission to accomplish? Do it whenever. No rush. It'll be there when you are ready. If you don't feel like doing it? don't. No stress, no bother, no worries. It's a great, relaxing and beautifully rendered game.</p>

      <p>Love the game. Its a quaint little cozy game, perfect to play alone or with friends! The community online are always so helpful and the mini game's are fun and easy to pass time with in between long waits. The romance options are fun, wish they were a little more in depth personally but I'm 100% a critic on that front, so disregard that bias. Without a doubt worth looking into and downloading. I can only explain this game like the following; if Animal Crossing met Stardew Valley, then had a child and that child met Legend of Zelda and had a child. This is that second child. I've spent 145 hours in this game as of when im writing this review. I expect to have more.</p>

      <p>Even though Palia is still in beta, it already feels like a complete game. I LOVE how different it is from anything else I’ve played. It’s open-ended, relaxing, and somehow still packed with so much to do! The quality is insanely good, the art style is beautiful, and the gameplay is just perfect. It’s one of those games that pulls you in, and before you know it, hours have passed.

There are so many quests, and I love how every skill, whether it’s hunting, fishing, cooking, or foraging—feels meaningful. Upgrading your tools and progressing takes time, but that just makes everything feel so rewarding. And the decorating?? Don’t even get me started! There are SO many options, and I could literally spend hours just making my home look cute.

One of my favorite parts is the party system because you actually grow and level up together. Playing with friends makes everything even more fun, and it feels like you're always working toward something. It’s just such a cozy, immersive world that I never get tired of.

Also, I HAVE to mention the cosmetics, yes, they’re expensive, but honestly?? They are SO pretty and beautifully designed that I don’t even mind spending my money on them. Every outfit and accessory looks amazing, and I already know I’m going to be buying way too many! 

The Palia community! Calling them nice and welcoming is AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! They are sooo nice, always helpful, and just make the game even better.

If you love games that let you explore, chill, and customize every little thing, Palia is 100% for you. Even in beta, it’s already amazing, and I can’t wait to see how it evolves. Easily one of my favorite games right now! ❤️

      <p>I recommend the game in the sense there is content, things to do and it seems fleshed out. It's your typical farming simulation RPG. I partially don't like it though because there is no PVE combat(I personally hate PVP). If there were some PVE combat, similar to what Stardew Valley has, then I would give this game 10/5 and 1000/100! At least an optional "dungeon" or cave instance that you don't NEED to complete but you *can* complete for some extra stuff would suffice. That way players can choose to do it. So for those who just want the farming sim, they can still have that without combat. Then for those who like to play it all, farming AND combat(PVE not PVP), an instance or cave with some monsters you can kill with a bow or sword would be an excellent(and welcome) addition to the game. Probably would sell more copies too! Especially since there is some talk about forging weapons by NPCs, why not have some PVE action in there too?

 I got this game thinking there was some sort of combat. Like a 3D Stardew Valley and I was so excited. Then I saw a comment about how there is no PVE combat and I immediately lost interest. At least make it an optional feature. Id like to refund the game otherwise, please.</p>

      <p>So this game was really fun at first. I liked the characters, the quests were fun and the town and world is really immersive and interesting. I thought that it was a really charming game, and that it would rot my brain for the next 100 hours but then my axe broke. 

I expected that it would simply not work, since I had gone through the necessary steps to upgrade it.. But I had to reupgrade it and it downgraded. People have mentioned that having to grind out resources is a problem.. It is. Having to find and grind out the individual ores is a CHORE, and maybe it's better with the community, but I shouldn't have to struggle because I like playing and doing things on my own. 

After 27 hours and my axe broke I was so annoyed that I had to gather all of my things, re-smelt them (which isn't instant.. it takes time like a mobile game would) and then i could go toward that next upgrade I was working on. It's annoying that there's no automated resource gathering for things you've already gotten and it's frustrating and punishing. I stopped a while ago, but it seems this is still an issue and that's really unfortunate.</p>

      <p>Seemed like a MMO version of Stardew/Portia/Sandrock, but sadly not so.  Fails in many areas; especially the farming aspects where you need to be in a party to get stuff??  WTF.  Just fail, loot should not be prerequisite on multiplayer.  I like to group occasionally, but it should not be mandatory for drops.  If I want to farm while watching a movie on my other monitor I should be able to.

Oh yeah..   FUCKING STORAGE LIMIT.  F.U.</p>

      <p>I have about 100hrs in the game before it came to Steam. Do not play this game, updates come slow, it's not an MMO and even over a year after release it's riddled with bugs. The only two things you do in Palia are skip through awful dialog and grind boring professions.

Fishing is alright, but that's difficult to mess up.

Don't waste your time on Palia!!</p>

      <p>Amazing game, but there's one issue no one talks about. If not for that one issue, it would probably be one of if not my favourite game ever.
First things first, the game overall is perfect. The graphics are great, the gameplay feels smooth and enjoyable, the soundtrack and atmosphere are top notch, the story is super immersive and the characters all have deep personalities and their own stories to explore. Everything in this game is done perfectly, it's just an amazing and very emotional experience, that you can enjoy along with a great, kind and very active community.
Yet, after not even 60 hours of slow gameplay, i finished the main questline, all the active side questlines and all the character questlines that interested me. I didn't have a single active quest. I started grinding fishing and bug catching for the night sky temple, which was much tougher than other quests but still really fun, and did some tiny quests that appeared along the way. Yet, after a while i just realised that i'm chasing something that's not there. The game was super enjoyable, fun and immersive but after finishing the main questline which turned out to be much shorter than i expected and i REALLY took my time completing it, the game turned to me searching for something to do cause i was too attached to the experience.
Technically in game it says that this is still a beta, but the steam store page showing it as a full experience is just misleading. Even though the only microstransactions are purely cosmetic, i still imagine that someone who payed for some cosmetics after seeing how great the game feels would be disappointed after realising that the game feels more like a demo than a finished, long term mmo experience.
It would be an amazing game that i would spend my money on, if it had at least 20x more content.
At this state, it's still worth playing because it's free, but prepare to be disappointed.
I love this game and it pains me to say it, but it's not worth getting into cause all you're gonna end up with is a bitter aftertaste and a thirst for something that was never there.</p>

But I cant recommend this game enough, if youre looking for cozy, time consuming, addictive gameplay this games for you. plus you can embrace your inner interior designer when making your in game home.</p>

The events are nice, the prizes are awesome, and it's completely free to play! Only thing you really need real money for is the outfits or pets, which is honestly nice!</p>

      <p>It's very time consuming and you have to do to much figuring out on your own. Inventory fills up to fast for someone free to play and just starting out. Planing for three hours and have yet to build a garden. To much exploring and again trying to figure out what to do and where to go even with the compass and quest tab.</p>

      <p>I have absolutely fallen in love with this game. It has a almost harvest moon type of vibe to it, but still brings it's own unique qualities to it that I don't feel like I've played it before. I am slowly learning all the npc's and really enjoy them all. I can't wait until I am able to explore the romance aspect of the game as well. The only complaint I really have is that none of the furniture is actually functioning. I can't sit in the chairs I've crafted nor am I able to use the bed, which I think would be a fun feature (though probably hard to accomplish since it is an open world game)</p>

      <p>For starters, the game is very immersive and filled with loads of lore! i don't think I've ever played a game like this before. However, with that being said the game play and controls ( I use a ps5 controller to play on my pc. It's just more comfortable personally ) are slightly difficult for me to follow. Besides this minor setback, i do enjoy the game!  I'm still learning how the game works but i would 10/10 recommend it for sure! :)</p>

      <p>It's free, cute, cosy. The NPCs are excellent and I loved interacting with them. The worldbuilding and graphics are decent.
Busybody work is expected in this sort of genre but it's made tedious by slow world traversal - fast travelling exists but it shouldn't need to, not for the distances required in such a big empty world. 

Unfortunately Palia misses the mark, it might be fun with friends but it's only halfway to the level you'd expect from a paid-for game.</p>

      <p>I really love this game and i thought i will play this for years but after finishing main quests and side quest which tbh didn't take me long i found this game pretty boring. You have only two ways of earning money basically and all you do is grinding same things all the time. For some things you even have to count on other players if they help you out or not. But not only that disappointed me. I was really looking forward to winter time in Palia because i just love winter seasons in games and i thought i will see pretty view of snow and decorations everywhere. But that didn't happen. You could see snow in some places but it looked as if it just melted, no winter atmosphere at all.

I'm really disappointed but i still hope maybe in the future we will have more things to do in here.</p>

      <p>So game great and relaxing for first 10h or so , but then is becoming a full time job as crops constantly need water and weeding ( no automation in here ) , quests are demanding more and more resources . Gathering is rather on meh side , animations are just terrible . For certain amount of time you can play by your self and then you need other players to gather end game materials ( which is extremely stupid design ) . Story is fun for about 1st 5-6 quests and it becomes bland . More efforts went to cash shop the to the game as there is so many minor bugs which could have been fixed anytime but no , devs keep adding more packs of cosmetic junk to cash grabbing shop then actually doing anything for the game . After a while game becomes very repetitive , boring , as there is not much to do , all there is to tend to your crops and keep gathering materials and thats that for entire game . oh and as you get higher tier tools , it feels like their made out of paper as you need to fix them every 2 min .</p>

      <p>- Overpriced cosmetics which can cost $50 and plans that it could get even more aggressive over time hard to imagine $50 outfits getting more expensive but I guess that's corporate greed for you
- Devs make promises and constantly break them
- Despite being a ''social'' MMO theirs a massive lack of things to do with other players
- MMO means massive and the game only features 2 small regions 
- Poorly optimised with some things looking terribly polished 
- Game can get extremely boring at times due to a lack of things to do 
- Upgrades take a serious amount of grind and even after a ton of playing you'll still feel like you have nothing to show ffor it 
- Next to no end game content to interact with 
- Don't bother giving your feedback as from what I can gather they print out your letters of concern and shred them as they haven't listened to the community
- Barely any events which are a cornserstone of MMO's

      <p>I get this game is in BETA, but a quick review;
Pros:
-Cutesy graphics
-Mind numbingly chill
-Simple
-It's the MMO version of Harvest Moon (that alone wins me over)

Cons:
-Extremely feminine character designs for the player (all the hair types are for chicks, or look like you do same relations for dudes corn (IYKYK)
-Literal game breaking bugs 
-Infuriating friendship system
-Frequent rubberbanding

The rate the game breaks (unable to swap weapons, unable to interact with NPCs or workstations, unable to do basic actions like climbing) is unreal. Yesterday alone, I had to have restarted a solid 4-5 times. This is worse on the Switch (do yourselves a favor and wait till a stable release if you want to get it for switch). 

When designing me character, I could not find a decent haircut for males. They all look so feminine and extremely...... yeah, (IYKYK) I mean, they use body type A and B so this isn't really a surprise. 

The whole friendship thing into romance thing is just slow. You climb friendship slowly, and is timegated. It looks liked they took a page from Blizzard. 

Biggest thing I think it's missing is a collections page. Seeing what fish you've caught, what bugs you caught, crops harvested, and so on. 

The rubberbanding makes me think I'm plating LoL for the first time when it released. 

But, I will give credit where credits due. If they remove the Type A - B body types, and added some additional hairstyles that suit the male body frame, thats a bonus (and something that gamers want). 
The biggest thing that needs to be looked into is the game breaking tool bugs the most though. Easily replicated, and if they wanted to hit me up with the steps to replicate it, happy to supply (I legit could not find a bug report form). 
The graphics as a whole are cute, but a lot do look ripped right from Fortnite (environments and housing), not going to complain about that, I do personally like that design. 

As soon as they fix the game breaking bugs, Ill swap to a hell yes recommendation.</p>

      <p>Palia offers a breath of fresh air in the MMO space, trading epic battles for cozy crafting and community building.  While some might miss the thrill of combat, the focus on life skills like gardening, fishing, and crafting is surprisingly engaging.  The charming world and intriguing lore provide a relaxing backdrop for building a home and forging friendships (and maybe even romance) with the diverse NPCs.  It's not without its early access hiccups, but Palia's potential shines through, offering a unique and addictive experience for players seeking a more chill and collaborative online world.</p>

      <p>Not for me, I didn't need to play long to understand the business model. I understand Palia is still in beta but I didn't find anything too engaging, very similar to Once Human. On top of that making you sign-up only to automatically connect it to my steam is a step too far.</p>

      <p>so ive never played a game like this where there is no pve or pvp but this game is worth it. kind of a grind but not to bad really well put together. i do of course want more but coming from once human and other games like that its a breath of fresh air. the only nit pick i have is the inventory system the game brings all chest together when looking though one. so it can get hard to find some things. that is the only nit pick i have 

If i had to give this a true review rating i would say 7.8 out of 10</p>

      <p>A perfect game for casual gameplay, very calm gameplay, until you need to be faster then everyone while colecting materials sometimes, but actualy game is perfect especialy in farming for materials not so boring like most of the games, character phisics simular to genshin impact and graphics, but mechanics are more like black desert life skills, but just that. I think that the game is very fun i would recomend for everyone.</p>

      <p>Palia is a delightful escape into a world where the pace of life is set by you. The game's blend of crafting, cooking, and farming is a joy to experience, and the ability to share these activities with friends adds a layer of warmth and community that's hard to find in many games. The developers have clearly put a lot of love into creating a world that feels alive and inviting, with each character and location having its own unique charm.

While the game is still in its early stages, the potential is immense. The developers have shown a willingness to listen to the community and make meaningful changes, which is a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry. The graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in the world design is impressive. The game's focus on exploration and discovery is a highlight, with each new area offering something new to see and do.

However, there are areas where Palia could improve. The game's progression system can feel a bit grindy at times, and the lack of a robust multiplayer experience can be a letdown for those looking for a more social gameplay experience. The premium store, while not intrusive, could be better balanced to ensure that players feel rewarded for their time and effort, rather than just their wallet.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Palia is a game that I find myself returning to time and time again. It's a perfect blend of relaxation and challenge, and the sense of community is something that's truly special. I'm excited to see where the game goes from here, and I have no doubt that with continued support and development, Palia will become a staple in the cozy gaming genre.</p>

      <p>Super Cozy game for sure! When you just want a break from all the zombie killing and battling out there, check it out. Quests, NPC interactions, events or just hang out on your plot decorate and do Cake Parties. There are some hiccups, but what game doesn't have it. For a free to play, it is very well done. Of course there is a store and you can buy outfits and items. You don't have to and still can enjoy the game with the basics. I enjoy this game in my downtime. Definitely would recommend. Players are usually very helpful and friendly.</p>

      <p>for what it is, it is not bad, if you have ever played FreeRealms, its sorta like that... sadly less activites and no cartoon fun fighting. aside from that Coins can be kinda hard to get alot of unless you stop doing the quests, which have a 50/50 change of taking most your savings.

Still would recommend if you are detoxing from the garbage pvp games of the last few years</p>

So many things to do, crafting, skills, quests, relationships, achievements. This game is NEVER boring. And the community is SO NICE! Very helpful and people work together. I started playing before it was on Steam and I love it so much! Highly recommend!</p>

      <p>Lovely game with lots to do and lots to accomplish, though admittedly it does pile on really fast at the start but there are plenty of chances to catch up before taking new quests. It is a little buggy sometimes (icon png files becoming neon and filled, floors disappearing, villagers and players glitching through the map) but it does not effect functionality and often disappears on its own. My wife and I got it to play together, and it is amazing, especially as neither of us are really into the combat based games like this, so this is just delightful. We are addicted and plan to play every day! The art style and character designs are immaculate, everyone feels fully rounded as a character and personality and just as every good game has, khajit has wares if you have coin! Really solid game, cannot wait to see it go up from here!</p>

      <p>This is a very cozy relaxing game. And the others playing are really nice too. Very similar to Star Dew Valley, but you don't have to sleep and there is no stamina bar. There are the usual cozy game things like fishing, gardening, decorating your house, and foraging. It is still evolving so I hope there will be even more fun things to do. If you try the game, check out the Hot Pot game in the Black Market.</p>

      <p>This game is a fun game, there is lots to do that keep you busy so you don't get bored. Quests eventually run out. I can't wait for more. However, you can work on leveling up your skills and decorating your home. Helping others complete their quests, join communities, have hunting, cooking, bug catching parties. 

Cons: The game does crash quite often. Lags more than I care for. You get stuck in conversation with the characters and have to restart your game. You will have glitches with joining parties with friends where you have to restart the game to be able to see each other's green dot on the map or that you are in a party together. Your equipment will fail to work sometimes and you will have to jump and pull out your glider to get it to work again. If that doesn't work, you will have to restart the game.

Good Luck!</p>

      <p>Palia is a great game overall, I have a lot of hours in it. The draw back is that its free...  If they would only charge for it they could at least afford servers to run the amount of players at any point. The game is so fun but the second you get into it it will lag/freeze/disconnect you, its BEYOND frustrating. I love this game, there's few things I would change except adding more decorations, rugs and plants but that's just me being picky at that point. Please please please buy more server space, it just makes you not want to play.</p>

      <p>I do recommend this game. Sometimes when small companies make a game and it hits big, they tend not to hear the voice of their fans. They now have money and why should they? But so far this company and game has still kept in touch with its fan base. That hits HUGE with me. It makes such a difference for investing in the game. If you dont matter to the game then its easy to move on, though sad game companies chose that path. 

I am someone who likes tasks and achievments and things to do. I also value and need a good community. If the chat is toxic Im out and un-installing fast. Life is to crazy atm to spend time in a game that brings you anything but joy. So for this game you can go achievments and hunting and plushies. Or you can spend time building your home and playing hot pot games, or even better you can do all that. Their are no time limits as we palians say its easier to be kind then not. Their are also tons of videos you can watch before choosing this game to make sure its right for you. I am mostly a solo player but their are tons of palians who will group up with you quickly. We received this growable furniture that was from shared party xp. I groaned, "oh no i have to find a group"...but it went wonderful actually. We all grouped up and made sure people had parties so they could get their furniture too. It was a nice way of doing things here and there. so watch some videos and then decide. But for me, I recommend it and it is nice and casual and relaxing.</p>

      <p>LOVE LOVE LOVE

This game is everything I've wanted from animal crossing and dreamlight valley, and has gone ABOVE AND BEYOND. The decoration system alone is absolutely amazing. The community is wonderful, everyone is always willing to help, and the way the game is designed truly fosters that. I love being able to hunt, mine, chop, forage, cook, and garden to my hearts content, and enlist the help of my friends along the way. Building friendships with the NPC's, the quests, the gifts, they are a tried and true system. I love the freedom this game gives me. Not even to mention how absolutely beautiful the game is. Its so well designed I don't even know where to start. From the cozy village to the countryside homes, to the breathtaking landscapes of the wilds. I haven't even finished the story line but I'm loving that too. 

My one and only complaint, is how expensive the furniture and housing expansions are, I can never seem to make money fast enough without absolutely grinding, which is not my favorite thing to do.

All in all though, I absolutely love this game. It has managed to do everything that big publishing companies could never manage, and all in BETA. I'm extremely impressed and very much looking forward to what this game achieves in the future. All my love to the developers, and thank you, so much.</p>

      <p>For a free to play game, I am really enjoying this one so far. Reminds me a lot of My Time at Portia but I sort of ran out of story line on that game so I was looking for something new.  Fits very well with casual players who like some input on how their story continues but not too much pressure at getting quests completed.</p>

      <p>This game has been an amazingly fun cozy adventure! The world is compelling and intriguing. The quests for discovery of who you are as a human in this world of Palians play like a solo dungeon crawl full of clues and puzzles to unfold a bigger sense of the world. If you enjoy the grind of farming and gathering, you can spend an entire game play session doing just that and never get bored! Or if you'd rather interact in a more meaningful way, you can build relationships with all the Palians who each have their own unique story and personality. They also unlock quests and challenges as you continue to get to know them, which feeds into your greater knowledge of the world outside the boundaries of Kilima! This game is at the top of my cozy gaming list, and is the kind of MMO I've been waiting for for a long time!</p>

      <p>Been playing for almost a year now and can say that I still do play every day I can. 

Yeah there are faults; Random glitches, bugs, ect. but from the almost year I've been playing I can confidently say, its dev team are usually already aware of a lot of issues and either hotfix them during the days/nights or have them fixed by the next patch. And those patches come around sooner than we realise (every 1 month theres usually something new). 

Graphics are nice and a lot of the times I use the camera mode to take ingame photos. Hunting is a lot of fun, there can be a few bugs at times regarding shots or glitchy animals, but usually its pretty smooth. Mining and bug catching are my favourite, (anyone that see's my ingame plot will know that) as its simple but also makes good Palian moneys. The players, especially the regulars, are amazing and friendly and because of that I've made many new friends because of Palia. 

Palia still has so much potential to grow, and with the new Elderwoods update soon to come, we all are hoping they will nail it. Until then, I'll be making my house for the 100000th time (my OCD goes a bit wild ingame, it's great) and waiting for the next patch's new things that keep me coming back!</p>

They are very good at listening to their players. I will be playing this game for a long time to come.

      <p>The mechanics don't really work for a cozy MMO, in my opinion... personally, it seems the way resources and minigames work creates more discourse and hostile enforcement of player-made rules than actual co-operation and genuine guidance for new players. It's especially not friendly for solo players, so my social anxiety and fear of being dog-piled for accidentally stumbling over said player-made rules has made me drop the game entirely. The game itself is fine, it's really the community that has driven me away from the game.</p>

      <p>This is a chill, no-combat game. I loved it -- for a week. That's all the time it took to level to the point where the game began forcing me to group with randoms just to gather crafting materials. This is advertised as an inclusive, 'be nice to everyone' kind of game. It is, but ONLY if you group with random people. If you want the relaxation of playing ALONE, you're not welcome.</p>

      <p>Ok, so, its free. But!..

You have good graphics (for an M(?)MObasebuilder indie project), you have good NPC's, with not too deep, but well-written stories. 

But mainly - the gameplay and mechanics. 

Imagine, you play, let's say, Hogwarts Legacy. And you have gameplay about making potions. Well, "have" is a too big of a word. You bring ingredients to cauldron, press a button, then running around like a fool for a minute. Not ten minutes, that will allow you to do something while its bubblin'. Not instantly. A minute. Of nothing to do.

And here you have Palia, where to cook something - you need a few different stations, in multiple quantities, and you need to PLAY at each of these. I won't say that it is helluva minigame, but it is interactive, and its fun. And its better than Hogwarts Legacy, a AAA game in Wizardring(may be misspelled) world universe.

And you can sense that in all of game contents. Its made with passion and devs think about their players, IMO.

Oh, and the community. Well done, Singularity 6.

A con for that would be that it is HARD to create male character that is not looking like total gay. Don't get me wrong here, I don't mind that, and I can understand from where this is going, but I want to have a choice. Yes, female char is a choice, I know.</p>

      <p>I've played far more than 57 hours - before I linked my account to steam. With that said, I cannot recommend the game, every update feels like it's another push to being a cashgrab, with them now even introducing a monthly sub style - kind of similar to how gacha games have this monthly sub where, when you log in daily, get some currency. Might be worth if you feel like wanting to buy all the cosmetics but honestly, it's so pointless. Instead of making the game more stable - everytime I play I have to restart the game atleast once because something get's bugged - they just push the premium shop more. After you've finished what is similar to bundles in stardew valley, there is not much to do besides grinding for materials to craft furniture to decorate. I do like how decorating works in this game, you can clutter up everything which is quite fun, but that's about it. Multiplayer is kind of a joke aswell, wish that you could own a plot of land with a friend for example and work on it together. So no, while I will probably continue playing on and off, wouldn't recommend to new players.</p>

      <p>the game is cute, but Gold feels too punishing and feels as if it limits play style to finding the "right way" to earn gold, which just sucks all of the fun out of what would and could be a cozy chill experience tbh, i also feel like what you sell isn't equivalent to the time of which it takes to acquire items to sell. There are alot of what seems like pointless and purposeful inconvenience features, you'd find in many mmo's like wow for example, but without a way to buy your way into convenience which i wouldn't want either but it just seems like they are pointless, for example the most obvious one, is the 30min time limit before you can go to your map and click on the return home button, most of the game i've simply just closed it or simply waited instead of doing anything because i wanted to do a specific thing, like go into ruins which require a glider to get to, so i grind for the glider but there are several progression locks and other things preventing me from doing so, i achieve this after a while and am completely underwhelmed and was when i reached the ruins just now not interested because the fun of discovering the game was killed by the meaningless time i spent doing meaningless things. i wouldn't usually be so annoyed but i did want to enjoy this and i do like the aesthetic. however i just can't reccomend this when the time sucking features within this game ruin even wanting to entertain learning about any sort of lore or story happening, when i started the game i actually enjoyed the characters now i couldn't care less because their dialouge boxes is just another thing taking time away from doing other things. /: and i really really like my home, but im not sure if i have the motivation to return. although i most likely will.. because i still haven't finished decorating it.</p>

Listen, you either have a game that is 90% walking, or a low poly untextured garbage, you can't have both.
Get some actual artists and PAINT. THE FVCKING. TEXTURES! Get some details!!! Add some contrast! The game is 90% walking and the visual style is that of a toddler lego set. There's absolutely no stimulation, just frustration from having to walk so much through flat, boring game. Make this game beautiful, make it a joy to just be in it, and then you'll get a perfect chill game. And maybe add a transportation or boost running speed. Right now it's a game for vegetables tho</p>

      <p>A fun, cozy game to play solo or with a friend. I've only had this game for a couple weeks and it's almost never failed to bore me. The artwork is beautiful, the mechanics are decent to work with, the story is really interesting. My favorite part is the social choices you can make. If you want to trade plushies in the Underground and talk to other players and make friends that way, awesome! If you want to just ignore everyone for the story, go for it. It doesn't look like there's a "wrong" way to play, it seems very open and I love that.

However, I do with there was more world to discover and move around in. There's a lot already, but it just feels like there could be a little more. I mean this is the case in a few games I've played, but here especially as it's an MMO. I've tried looking just today for other MMO games to scratch that itch but Palia seems to be the only one I can find. Regardless, definitely a top tier game in my book.</p>

      <p>If you get stuck go to the mini map and click on your house and click on the return home button. This is important to remeber as swimming is not implemented in the game. Also you may find it a bit like harvest moon, gathering wood, stone, ore, and the selling box. And the farming.</p>

I like the characters, and really just the overall idea that you're there to help the community. The game space is quite friendly, and it feels good to work towards the community.

It's like they said to themselves "Diversity and inclusion? Well, of course that means ugly purple humanoids, all with a modern Pixar "quirky" personality.
In all sincerity, it's fine for kids looking for some after school game-play, the constant popups with "hints" and "directions" is infuriating but eventually go away (kinda). As long as you're not interesting in too much customization this might be a good game for you.</p>

      <p>REALLY LOVE IT!!!! Not only that Palia is free but it is a mixture of two games I have played and also loved the most: Medieval Dynasty and Stardew Valley ((((: Can't believe I missed out on so much, I just got back to playing/gaming after months and months of being a corporate shrimp. Good to be back and vvvv happy Palia was what I chose to play first after all the bad and toxic stuff I went through. You can chill but you can also choose to get "grind-y" at the same time with this game, it's really up to you how you want to enjoy it. So yea, BIG up to the devs and everyone who keeps working hard for this game. You guys rock!</p>

      <p>Palia is cute, and actually cozy like it states. So if you like games like that, then i'd recommend it but please keep in mind the massive issues that hide behind the tags of being "Cozy". Side note, this game IS IN OPEN BETA. It is NOT full release yet like they like to lead you to believe, and have BANNED people from the Official Discord for pointing it out. Now lets get into it.

Pros:
- Cozy
- Cute environment
- Great for mindless gaming and hanging out with friends
- Cute Concept

Cons:
- Terrible execution
- Money hungry leads (they had 50 million to do this project and lost most of it from over-hiring and poor monetization)
- As said above; Poor monetization
- Premium shop gets more releases every monthly patch than ACTUAL CONTENT. 15-20USD to buy a PET and around 30-70 for the outfits, some of them having special VFX that do nothing in-game other than idle animations
- Ported over to Nintendo Switch BEFORE it was even stable on PC
- Leadership has said they're very much uninterested in listening to any sort of positive / constructive feedback from the community.
- VFX issues that FLASH and HAS given people seizures. 

There's more but i have a limit here. so ill leave it off with a couple of Con posts from past Singularity 6 Devs:

"The Leadership does not actually listen to people. They smile and nod while people talk, but then don't act on the things people say; they just explain why the thing they decided is what we're doing. Tragically, they probably think that they are listening, but they're not. They're hearing, but they're not listening. When people say things that they don't want to hear, they ignore it. This is both internally and externally. There is almost no insight into why new players try Palia and stop playing. They instead focus on what the most die-hard players like."

"The leadership of S6 truly drove Palia into the ground. It breaks my heart that a project where 200 folks poured themselves into it, got ruined by poor decision making made by a handful of people. They hired massively talented people, truly the best in the industry. Just to ignore their wisdom and experience."

Thanks for reading if you did. 

Edit: i have 188 hours on Steam, and probably another 500 on the standalone launcher before steam release and have spent most of that time in the Discord.</p>

      <p>Palia is a relaxed game, there is no time limit or other pressure to do your things. no stamina bar either, so you can take your time doing your stuff whenever you want. Quests are mostly fun to do and there is all sorts of things here. Gardening, mining, tree chopping, exploring, fishing.  You can talk to NPC´s and befriend them, which opens new quests. Downside of the game: Grinding and only able to give q present per week to NPC´s so leveling up friends bar is taking a long time.
Overall i would give it 8/10.</p>

      <p>If you like a laid back grinding game with all sorts of neat quests and areas to explore plus friendly people, this game is for you. I love playing this because I like the many different fish you can catch, the many meals you can prepare, and the furniture you can make.  Most of the star items you are able to display on your plot too. You get to create your own home on your plot of land too! 
The people playing the game are very helpful and kind (this is unusual for games like this in my experience).
The graphics are great and you have the ability to change your character's appearance any time you want to. The story line is neat too.
One of the things I would like to see changed is the ability to gift star items to players requesting the item as well as the base item.
I highly recommend this game.</p>

      <p>I'm just here for the gamer girls, for real.  If you loved Stardew Valley then you are in for a treat.  I passed this game up when I saw a review saying there were too many in game purchases you have to make, but that is simply inaccurate.  The only purchases you make are simply cosmetic for new clothes, virtual pets, and landscapes to build your home on.  You can play this game for free no problem if you don't mind running around in basic wally world clothes.  I also read a review that said they felt the MMO aspect of the game was tacked on, and I disagree.  This game is way more fun to play with other people and you can find plenty of Palia groups on discord that will help you do that.  The community of players is super chill and helpful, and I can't say enough good things about them.  It's really the community that makes me want to continue to keep playing.  I feel like the writing is pretty solid and some of the characters have some real depth to them.  The game is still in beta, and while there are some bugs, I haven't experienced anything that has made me have to stop playing the game; all you have to do is take a moment to hit a loading screen and switch servers and the bug will go away.  I'm excited that the makers are adding new content and a whole new map is set to be released in early 2025.  I would say you can expect to get 250 hours out of this game before you've unlocked all the major upgrades, and some people continue to play the game even after a full year.  If you want this game to have longevity, you'll really have to enjoy the decorating / home building aspect as well as collecting the in game plushies.  Good games make me want to start playing as soon as I wake up in the morning, but this game exceeded that and made me want to stay up all night.</p>

      <p>Oh my goodness, stepping into Palia feels like slipping into your coziest pair of pajamas after a long day! This game is the epitome of adorable with its vibrant landscapes and charming characters that make you want to befriend every single one of them.

From the moment you start you are welcomed into a world where you can craft your own little slice of paradise. Whether you're planting flowers catching bugs or just chilling by the riverside with your new pals everything in Palia is done with such a gentle soothing vibe.

The character customization is a bit lacky because of the paywall of outfits but if you can you should support and buy one outfit. I mean who wouldnt want to dress up their avatar in the cutest outfit while theyre out gathering resources or cooking up a storm? And speaking of cooking its not just about making food but also its about sharing moments with your in-game buddies just like a real-life potluck but with magical ingredients!

One of the best and sweetest parts of Palia is its community. The game encourages teamwork without any pressure making it the perfect place for those who love cooperative play but arent into the competitive scene. You can work together to build explore or unravel the mysteries that hide beneath the surface of this enchanting world.

The visuals are just heart-meltingly beautiful. With its soft pastel palette and whimsical designs every corner of Palia looks like its been painted with love. The music adds to this cozy ambiance making every little activity feel like a warm hug.

And lets talk about that storyline - full of mysteries and lore that gently unfolds as you play. Its like being part of a bedtime story that you never want to end!

In essence Palia isnt just a game but its a getaway to a place where every day is a new opportunity to find joy in the simplest of activities. If you are looking for a game to unwind with to make friends and to indulge in some delightful escapism Palia is your new cozy home. Totally recommend diving into Palia for a heartwarming adventure, chill and cozy gameplay and sweetest community!</p>

      <p>Palia is not a game for you if you like fast pacing or shooters.  This game has soooo much to do, build relationships, farm, hunt, fish, gather... quests galore.  The ingame dialogue is interesting and even scandalous at times.  There are a few Palia trackers avail to help you keep track of daily, weekly, and quest tasks. You can play together with upto 3 of your friends and everyone in the party gets drops while working together to hunt, farm etc... even cooking.  Flow trees need more than one person to chop down, so working together as a community to clear groves becomes a fun part of the game.  You can also hunt magical Sernuk,  Muujin, and Choppa together and everyone get the loot.  You will spend hours on this game, so grab a drink and snack.  Enjoy the beautiful graphics and fun game play.  

You will need at least 16GB RAM to run this game smoothly and a high speed Internet connection for the best results.</p>

      <p>great with lots of potential, but i do feel its missing some components to attract people, a big one being advertisement, when i first saw this game i thought it was every other boring farm game like the ones everyone's grandma plays, but it isnt, but how would anyone know that? advertisement needs an upgrade i believe because once i tried it(convinced by a friend) i found that its super cute and i love the world and decorating! 
the second thing that needs improving, is we NEED some kind of spawn points or waystones, the map is huge and thats just the first main village one, theres another big map! i love big maps, but without some kind of transportation(horse?idk) or waystones Its a absolute chore to be running around, theres a teleport button for your home, but you can only use it every TWENTY MINNUTES??? Im sorry its a bit ridiculous. Id love to play this game more because you can decorate your home and expand and can romance villagers, but the running around for 30 minutes trying to navigate this huge map is too much of a chore without any spawns/waystones, So I really tried but i wont be playing until theres waystones implemented of some kind, and that timer on your home teleport is AT LEAST lessened because 20 min is way too much. 
also it says its multiplayer, but theres literally nothing to do with other players, they just run around the map, idk if the team will add some kind of multiplay or co-farm but if they removed multiplayer thered be absolutely NO difference or change, kinda dissapointing since i wanted to play with my friend.

Other than all of that, this game has a lot of potential and i def recommend for a free game, but i warn you you will be running around more than half the time.</p>

      <p>I like the game a lot, but it has so many problems I can't recommend it. The glitches are tolerable, if annoying, but it's the intense focus on overpriced, paid content that I can't get behind. The main story line is also lacking, and there's not enough content in general for me to really appreciate the game. I'll continue to push my grievances to the side until the next update, but I'm not holding out hope tbh.</p>

      <p>This game is amazing! I have sunk quite a few hours into it now and I am still uncovering new quests and mechanics I didn't know about. Here are my favourite things about Palia.

- The amount of decoration options you have for your home plot is amazing. It's also incredibly easy. You grow trees and flowers for the plot and create beautiful pieces of furniture.
- The grind for items is real. You will spend ages fishing, chopping trees and mining rocks but for me it didn't feel that bad. Maybe it is different for others but I had fun!
- The store is surprisingly cheap, not more than the average big Fortnite skin, and for a free game it makes sense too. The outfits and gliders are cute.
- The story and NPC's are amazing! It's so interesting to be the human in this new world after the age of humans. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here. The villagers as well are adorable and all have their own personalities. I am partial to Jina and Hodari.
- The map is gorgeous! The art style and designs of locations and buildings are amazing. I can't count the number of times I just stood in a flared grove watching the pink dust fly into the sky.
- Mechanics are so amazing here. The flared trees and fishing is so fun. I love fishing for once. I own enjoy fishing in this game and Far Cry 5!
- Progression is wonderful. You unlock dialogue with certain NPC's and join associated clubs when you reach level 10, gaining new tools, recipes and other fun items to help you along.
- With the tools given to us, the community is so wonderful! Everyone is so nice and the gifting system makes it good fun to help others.

Few cons
- Customisation options are lacking a little bit but I'm not too fussed.
- The RNG from fishing and bugs is a bit too hard for me. After fishing for 4 real life days I still don't have the fish I want.

Bar that it's perfect! The game is wonderful and I can't wait for it continue. The devs are doing a great job and I urge you to play it and if you enjoy it drop a few coins on the cute outfits and pets you can buy through the premium shop!</p>

      <p>Reminder: This is an Early Access game. And, it's free, so don't be too judgy. 

Rating: 8/10 and getting better with every update. I'm really looking forward to the planned Q2 2025 Elderwoods update!

Palia is a cozy MMO, sim (farming, resource management, building) and exploration game with a surprizing depth of (maybe not-so-cozy) lore, which is great. Play with friends to earn more loot, explore two large region maps for items as you complete quests, and level up friendships and romances (if you want) with quirky villagers whose stories are strong and endearing. The main story is intriguing and puzzle-driven, and poses low-medium challenge. 

If you want to relax in a low-combat game and just explore all its world has to offer, this game's for you.

      <h4>Thumbs Down (Anonymous, Steam, 2025-01-22)</h4>
      <p>Before I get into my review, I want to note that while my Steam profile shows just over 60 hours in Palia, I’ve played the game far more through the client. I participated in its alpha phase and spent additional time playing directly through the client before it became available on Steam.

I was initially drawn to Palia because it was pitched as the ultimate cozy farming/life sim game... combining all the elements I love in an MMO setting. It felt like a dream game in theory. However, that initial promise has shifted dramatically.... the game no longer even markets itself as an MMO (It did in development phase. There's 25 ppl per instance). 

While updates have been announced periodically, they often feel like a letdown for me. It seems the focus is mostly on paid premium content like outfits, pets, and tool skins. While those cosmetic options are nice, what the game really needs is GOOD engaging content.

The housing and decorating system is the highlight of Palia for me. Compared to other cozy games, it stands out for its creativity and flexibility, allowing for freeform building if you have imaginative ideas. Unfortunately, the rest of the content feels too repetitive and boring. Hunting, for example, involves just two animals. Earning money can be frustratingly slow, especially for players who don’t have a lot of time to invest into the game.

Here are some suggestions for improvement:

-Introduce ranching and the ability to gather ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter yourself instead of relying solely on the shop
-More open world animals (even if not solely for hunting)
-Add events and cute cutscenes with romance partners to make relationships more interesting
-Create more open world activities and events that would encourage players to gather for fun, meaningful rewards

There’s more that could be done, but this is already getting too long. If you enjoy the game as it is, that’s great! However, for me, Palia feels like it has a lot of untapped potential. While I’ll hop on occasionally, it doesn’t hook me the way other farming and life sim games do.

I don't recommend for the long term, but you can try it out for yourself.</p>

      <p>The general atmosphere of Palia is quite inoffensive, with clean visuals and gameplay. However, the experience is locked behind real time paywalls from grinding for resources and spending hours running around the world to waiting hours and days of actual time for things to happen in game. They claim to promote a social environment, and then have the servers be multilingual. You cannot socialize effectively with players who do not speak the same language. The NPC's are not interesting to talk to. I don't think this is a bad game per se, and since most of the issues are game design related all of them could be fixed easily, but as it stands I cannot recommend sinking time and energy into this.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the newest update has made the game completely unplayable.

There are frequent updates for this game. Unfortunately they prioritise cash shop items. There are many many bugs. From simple texture issues and Non functioning game mechanics to complete game crashes and log in failures.

While the updates come with minor bugs fixes they don't address a large number and introduce way more than they fix.

This game is in Beta but it's late into Beta and has become completely unplayable for many. If it makes it to full release I may try again and adjust my review. However based on the companies priorities I doubt it will get a full release.</p>

      <p>Decent game, ok graphics. They want to 'protect' the playerbase so much there is no way to do a direct tell. And you can only group with someone if they are right in front of you.

The events are 100% CRAP. You only have limited time to get the rewards. In chappa chase you have to get 25 in one event. I have yet to see anyone get it. There are only a total of about 100 to get in the time limit with 10-20 people chasing them. There is a card game where you compete against 3 other people, yet you need to get 10 wins. The event runs for 1 week and there are only 12 times a day the event is active. Then you will have to wait for ANOTHER YEAR to try to get them again. Except for the limited time ones, which you will never be able to get

You have to group for things like chopping flow trees, yet you have to compete i AGAINST people to get the few no $$$$ real money items. Pure 100% crap</p>

      <p>I had high hopes for Pallia—the game concept is fantastic, and the community aspect is one of its strongest points. However, my experience has been deeply disappointing due to the game's lack of progress on crucial issues.

The game has been plagued with bugs and glitches for a long time, many of which are well-known among players. Despite repeated feedback from the community, it seems like no serious effort has been made to address these issues or improve the gameplay experience.

Instead, the focus appears to have shifted almost entirely to releasing new cosmetic outfits for real-money purchases. While I understand the need for monetization, it feels frustrating to see so much attention placed on paid content while long-standing problems remain unaddressed.

It’s disheartening to see a game with so much potential stall in its development. Unless the developers prioritize fixing these issues and showing they genuinely care about the community’s feedback, it’s hard to recommend this game to others.</p>

      <p>Very good game with a lot of potential. It makes a lot of fun whether alone or in a group. You can choose the speed at which you want to play, which makes it easy to get lost in the game. 

Great graphics and a great game.
I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing and immersive experience.</p>
