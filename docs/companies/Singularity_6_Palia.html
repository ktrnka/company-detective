      <h4>Thumbs Up (Anonymous, Steam, 2024-09-17)</h4>
      <p>Not for introverts but extroverts will enjoy. I've played this game almost 100 hours now and while I did enjoy playing it I probably won't play for much longer. Once I got to Exquisite Level Tools it got unplayable for me personally. I am extremely introverted and I like solo playing games. I don't like talking in game chat and will do everything I can to avoid it so once you reach the stage where you need an insane amount of Flow Wood Planks then I can't really enjoy playing anymore. I don't want to have to constantly call out for help to grind flow trees that are uncuttable without a group to make cute furniture. Clothes cost ~$30 or more a set, pets are something like $15 and you can't get them any other way but through the premium shop. Crops take at least 3 hours of real time to grow with watering in between and if they aren't watered their growth pauses so no planting and logging back in later to collect. Takes an hour to process a single crop to increase it's value and you're limited to 9 plots of soil (9 plots w/ 9 spaces so 81 crops total) so you can't really grind crops for money quickly. There is also no way to trade other players or give things away to another person. You can make a request for an item you've already obtained but not one you haven't gotten yourself before and you can't ask a specific person to fill the request. Overall it's cute and a fun game to kill some time but I don't want to be forced to interact with people just to continue playing.</p>

      <p>I'm so obsessed with this game! There's so much to do and it's really addicting, the world feels vibrant and beautiful, and I really love the characters as well! Jel has definitely stolen my heart though. ♥ The community is also quite friendly and helpful, which is really nice to see! ♥ I haven't done much socialising though and can comfortably play the game solo or with my partner. Cosmetics like outfits and skins are monetised which kinda sucks but all the rest of the content is free, plus there is more to come as the devs keep working on improving the game. It can be a bit buggy sometimes but it hasn't turned me away from the gameplay at all, in fact, it's hard to stop. I am writing this at 3 am and I really really need to go to sleep but as soon as I wake up I will probably jump right back to it because it's my current hyperfixation. And also I need to talk to Jel. I always need to talk to Jel. Comfort game go brrrr.</p>

      <p>This game isn't even in Beta 0.2 yet and there's an ocean of content. I will gladly pay for overpriced cosmetics if it means we can keep this game in development. It has bugs and needs polish here and there but I'm loving what is available right now</p>

      <p>I didn't really like the fact that there's no goal. I feel like a game needs more than just gather resources, use resources and do fetch quests for boring NPCs. To me it feels like a mobile game on PC.

I guess if you like to build a house, this game is OK, but even then there are games that have much better base building AND have a lot more to do otherwise. I would give it a 3/10 - there's nothing that makes you want to continue playing the game. If nothing interesting happens during the first 5 hours of a game, i feel like it's already lacking. There's no incentive to keep playing, it feels like 1/4 of a game.</p>

      <p>[h1] A Splendid and Tranquil Online Game [/h1]
Palia unfolds in a serene embrace, where melodies drift like whispers on the wind, the world is painted with beauty, its colors soft and inviting, offering endless hours of peaceful pursuits for those who find joy in the gentle rhythm of life’s simpler tasks.
And characters, with their quiet allure, that blossom in your heart over time.

Basically, I like it—quite pleasing!

It's a life-sim, farm sim that you play at your own pace, with no rush whatsoever. You can play solo or get to know others and do activities together.

It shines in the art of home design, perfect for those who delight in crafting beautiful spaces.

You must know, this may be repetitive for some with its grinding mechanics. You will have to decide if it’s your thing or not, but the game is free and there aren’t any imbalances between players. You only buy cosmetics that do not influence game progression.

It has its own Wiki in case you find it hard to understand what to do, and the community is pretty helpful as well. Just ask your questions in chat, and they'll guide you.

[h3] [u] It's unfinished, so it's not perfect, but it's still pretty good. [/u] [/h3]

Occasionally buggy, loot can sometimes get stuck in the ground, which can be annoying. This happened to me while I was trying to catch a Rainbow-Tipped Butterfly, if I remember correctly. I spent a long time searching for it, only to find it stuck and unavailable for pickup afterward.

I don't find certain puzzles in the story quests engaging; they could use some improvements, but it's not enough to make me stop playing.

Your character moves rather oddly at times, especially when running short distances or climbing. These areas could benefit from some visual and physics enhancements.

And a few other quirks scattered about.

[b] I played Palia before it was on Steam, so I have more hours invested than it shows here. I've completed most of the available content. I believe it has great potential. [/b]

7/10 for now.</p>

      <p>I've been playing this game for a while! It's really fun. The music here is so relaxing. If you like Stardew Valley, you'll definitely enjoy this.

There's lots to do. It's got farming, designing, and going on adventures. On top of that, it's a free game. SUPER NICE, RIGHT?

 I hope this game will develop their storyline more and more. I'd be so excited to see more creatures and have more quests.</p>

      <p>I would have definitely recommended this game not too long ago, my mom and I LOVE this as a game we can play long distance. Cooking and hunting are our favorite things to do together. But after this last update EVERYTHING IS WRECKED! We're falling through floors, our aquariums are covered in checkerboard, stuff in my house is randomly disappearing and our game randomly crashes. Until the devs fix this I can't recommend this, like at all. You and your buddies are just going to get severely frustrated. *sigh*</p>

      <p>This game fails to deliver on it's genre.
I would have rather paid like 25 bucks for the game instead of it being free if it made all the difference in quality.

The graphics are less that sub par using the bland washed out cartoon breath of the wild or genshin impact style, except theres no cell shading or graphical effects. The sky doesnt even have any effects for the sun or clouds. The sky is just a blank dome with a 2D image of 4 clouds that rotate on an axis 24 hours a day indefinitely. The skybox is also a low resolution texture of a mountain that you can see the rough pixel edges of without even zooming in. There are no weather effects. You don't get season changes, rain, snow, fog, anything like that.

Crafting is less than rewarding. Your tools have durability and break, upgrading them costs a fortune and hardly make a difference. For example, upgrading a pick axe still requires the same number of hits to destroy rocks because it goes by damage instead of gathering time. Crafting is automated by machines that you are limited by inventory space and time to use.

The game is also severely lacking in content and full of nearly game breaking bugs, including tools failing to equip, broken animation loops, and quest descriptions that stick and overwrite newer quest descriptions. These are just a tiny few of the bugs.

Bug catching is a nightmare. instead of using a net, you have to forage and craft these items that copied pokemon pokeballs, which all have a small chance of successfully capturing the bugs. you can often throw up to 6 or even 8 of these at a single bug and still not catch it. The bugs dont even sell for enough money to pay for the materials used to capture said bugs.

The NPCs personalities are all very dry and you cannot actually have conversations with them, you are able to interact with them less than you can NPCs in a game like skyrim. They only talk to you when you want to, and its on par with the characters from Animal Crossing.

In fact everything in this game feels like a cheapened imitation of Animal Crossing, you roam around collecting or trying to grind for things to make pennies on the thousands of dollars it takes to upgrade your house space. Everything is time gated. There is hardly any content in the game at all, there are no big areas to explore, no combat, no dungeons with treasure, and not even any tools to socialize or express yourself with other players.

That is probably where the game drops the ball the hardest is with player interaction. There are very few clothing options in the game and they all look the same and have some kind of paisley pattern you cannot get rid of. (Paisley is the kind of pattern you find on bandannas irl.) They also want you to spend upwards of 16 to 30 dollars on a single outfit which are mostly comprised of just a shirt and pants. You cannot layer clothing, accessorize, paint or dye your clothing, its either you get it the way it is from the shop and thats it. There are also no players interacting or having conversations in town. They're all just grinding out resources and money. This is probably because theres no chat bubbles, chat console hides itself so you cannot even casually read server chat, and there arent ways to engage or hang out with nearby players. You cannot even sit on furniture in the town, much less go down to the tavern in the game and have a meal with your friends, even though there is a tavern. The character animations are very stiff and robotic, from the idle, running...and thats really the only animations your characters do. They dont really seem alive. They don't stretch, yawn, look around, or transition into other animations well at all. When you go from a hard sprint into standing again, theres about 3 frames inbetween, it looks about at rough as T-posing.

The housing system. This is the big one, probably the only part of the game where most of the budget went into. You can tell they tried to put some effort into this but its still roughly designed and not executed well. For example, you can build walls for your house so its not just one big room, the walls only go halfway up to the ceiling, you can place a wall near the ceiling instead and leave a gap near the floor big enough for you to walk through, but you cannot stack two walls on top of eachother because the ceiling height is exactly one grid space lower than the height of 2 wall pieces. so you cannot build rooms in your home.If you try to make them overlap instead, there is a massive space between the layers. Containers are cosmetic only and non-functional, you also cannot put furniture wherever you want. Want to put a flower pot on top of your dresser? you can't. Want to put up wallpaper? only for the bottom half of the wall. Want to hang things from the ceiling? you can't. Want to add a window in the corner? you can't. Want to change the walls of your house or the shape of them to not just be a big cube? you can't. Want to have a flower garden? you can't. Fireplace? no. Cupboard with items? no. You cannot do anything detailed with your house leaving it forced to look unlived in, cobbwebbs would look more believable at home in your house than a person living there.

Games that did housing better than Palia and arent even life sim games: Black Desert, Elder scrolls online, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, Raft, Craftopia, Legends of Aria, Phantasy Star Online 2.

In summary, Nothing this game has as a feature really feels in depth or immersive. You cannot specialize in a field of crafting, theres not even that many things to craft, player interaction just isnt even there (not even for roleplay.)

If i had to come up with an analogy for this game, its being thirsty and trying to enjoy a glass of water, but the cup is like 90% ice and you're constantly slurping and shaking the glass and waiting for the ice to melt to get a tiny sip and just give up and walk away thirsty when theres a full glass of water for FREE around any other corner.</p>

      <p>It's peaceful and relaxing. Explore and adventure at your own pace. The NPCs are really well done with great story lines. 
If you like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing, this will also be up your alley.

      <p>Played for roughly 2 weeks, when i found out there is cap for garden plots. I would say this is the easiest way to make money, which you need for EVERYTHING. Want to make your house bigger - money, Want to make your tools better - money. Decorations, plot size, machinery permits, you have to pay money for everything. However the grind doesnt get easier as you progress in the game. You still have only hunting, fishing and mining. Doesnt get much faster, easier or less boring. I find it is normal thing in the begining of game to grind, but there should be oportunity to use machinery to make money later. Also procesed materials should cost more than raw materials, thats just logic. Not in this game!</p>

      <p>Both male and female characters have female animations (run, sprint, or basically any action) and it just looks terrible on males.

I remade my character to look like a female just because I don't wanna watch my guy wiggle his posterior with every action he makes.

Knowing the devs, they probably won't make masculine animations and instead just ruin feminine ones. It's a shame.

And I really don't know why every company has to add boring mini-games into professions, do what Blizzard did when they were a good company, click > progress bar > done.

Besides that, game is an overall good time-sink if you're into this type of game, a bit grindy.</p>

      <p>The vibes are just so cozy and nice and I really really enjoy talking to the people in town

The quest design is fun and isn't too complicated and somehow the game managed to implement my least fave kind of puzzle in a sparing and fun manner

I really recommend giving it a shot if you're looking to just vibe and chill because overall, this is a no pressure environment with many possibilities for things to do, but with enough pointers as not to feel aimless, so you won't have an issue with things like choice paralysis either

In summary - cozy vibes, fun characters and a lot of things to do but only if you want to</p>

      <p>(THis game is still in BETA, and I understand this. This review is personal yet vague enough and sorry I am not going to go into the "whys" of some of this review as it's again personal stuff. Just simply, my own review. This most likely will change in the future as the game develops more...
Anyhow, okay, time for my weird and honest review:

1., I love this game. It is quite addicting. It reminds me of a mixture of games, including a much older game that I grew up with that unfortunately has been shut down long when I was still young. Seeing a game with a similar-ish style and playstyle really allows me to get into this game. To me, I'd say the games are close enough and may even get more similar things added!

2. Relaxing. Very relaxing. I like building games like these where you build your life from the ground up. 

3.  I am epileptic along with other things. And can I just say how much I ADORE there for once being a warning something???
Not just a warning, but a warning that gives you useful ideas and instructions and really just encourages being healthy and safe! Just having a warning there to begin with really puts me at ease and shows that they care. I've talked to devs that have pretty much told epileptics "oh, sucks to be you. Why should we cater for you?" and that can make the world honestly feel even more lonely. I mean I get there is a whole debate that could happen right now from what I am about to say, but hey, why not just put a quick warning in your games? Like how hard is that? Or just not be lazy and make decent lighting...
But, I am not here to complain. I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE IT A GAME EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. And for the photosensitivity stuff, I give this game an A+ from me.
By the way,
I have seen some *weird* stuff flash in and out in the game, but that's really just new game bugs that sometimes just aren't preventable. As for ME, I find the game's lighting and sensitivities and all to be pretty okay. I can't speak for everyone who is photosensitive, but I can say for myself the game is fairly good with that. The character creation screen *may* be sensitive to some, so just make sure to look or keep turned away away at the start of that during the dialogue until it is over.
Seriously though, thanks for adding this.

4. Einar asked how my day was, I was having a bad day and said so ingame to him, and he gave me a shiny rock to make me feel better. That actually made my day a bit better. Thanks.

5. Unfortunately (due to the next thing), I can't get too much into the lore, but I wish I could. This game is full of diverse characters and quests. I love the worldbuilding and CHARACTER BUILDING especially that the devs put into this game! Very nicely done and not at all unnoticed!

(the next one is a bit personal and super weird and specific and for summary, is just me blabbing about how much I dislike the game shoving humanity down my throat. So if that confuses you, just skip it)
6., 
[spoiler]Personally I really dislike how much into humanity this game goes. I haven't fully played the quest and keep skipping the dialogue as I am someone who cannot connect to humanity in the slightest. With a game with humanoids and robots, and I am STUCK as a human in a fantasy world, I find it incredibly discouraging. If it has lore like this game, I'd want a game that focuses more on BEING AN INDIVIDUAL and not humanity. Playing as a human is overused and I really can't connect or even care about the plot because it's so centered around humanity and is constantly down your throat about it. Again I understand this is a weird opinion, but I prefer the idea of focusing more on building an individual than clumping them with a species or whatever. Especially in a game that's meant to be an escape from reality. I don't want to be a human in fantasy, why would I want that? I don't want connection to the real world at all when I play games. I like escape. Helps dysphoria a lot and helps with stress---which is WHY I like games like this. Just none that are exactly like this game exist where I can play as a freaking robot or monster or even just a humanoid/inhuman thing (just stating for context, I mean more I'd be down for playing as one of the robots or something like that). I think this game could work on that, but again this is very much a personal addition to my review and simply something I more hope the devs see, probs not but who knows. Just saying, even like just a skin or removing the characters CONSTANTLY shoving humanity down my throat every chance they have would make this game PERFECT for me. Seriously, I can't stand the dialogue because all it does is talk about a topic I am already big no about.[/spoiler] 

----
While I understand thew devs have their own visions and for all I know my own visions could be colliding with what this game is all about, I just wanted to state it. Again, maybe any complains from I or anyone will be seen and something will be added to accommodate. I mean heck, if they are by some miracle taking inspiration off of my all-time favourite game, they may add different formes you can become like skins or spells or something for at least the human problem. Again, it's still in beta so it's whatever. I still love the game and want to support it, even if my brain at the moment may not agree with it. (sorry)

Anyhow, devs, keep up the great game</p>

      <p>I simply can't believe this is a free game.

To explain:
1. There is NO pay to win because there is no PVP, only PVE and it is grind based, and no, there are no RMT purchases that would speed that grind up to my knowledge.
2. You can unlock everything with gold that you can easily earn/farm as F2P
3. World is fun, quests are many and there is even romance!

Cons:

1. Still buggy from time to time but nothing horrible, it's understandeable since i'm currently at version 0.183
2.Grind is quite long for rep and collectibles but this isnt a bad thing in my opinion, i just feel some people wont have patience.

To summarize:
This is like runescape without PVP..... you hunt, cook, fish, talk to people and build your house that nobody can ruin ^^
Highly recommended as a relaxing game.</p>

      <p>Palia—where you can spend 10 minutes on character customization and then lose yourself in a never-ending grind of gathering rocks, bugs, and building random crap. 
It’s like an Amish town simulator where you hoard resources and craft pointless items for a your town and helping out in the community. 
And the best part? It’s free-to-play, so you can waste hours pretending you're in a rustic reality show without spending a dime. 10/10, perfect for those days when you want to be productive without actually doing anything.</p>

      <p>The experience is very chill. I love that I can just pop in every few days and plant some plants, mine some ore, make some furniture, or to some quests for townsfolk. Getting to play with my family sometimes is also nice.

I won't tell you that it revolutionizes anything, but I really appreciate their dedication to making a chill game where you can just play and there's no dying or PvP. (There's kind of PvE in that there's hunting, but that's also one-sided, and you're never at risk of taking damage.)

The story is pretty original and enjoyable so far. If reading the description sounds like something you would be interested in, then yes, you will probably like this, as that's more or less exactly what you get.</p>

      <p>It's a bit glitchy on my system and can get a bit slow, but when it works properly it's really fun and even when it glitches, so long as it doesn't completely slow to a halt, which has happened a few times, the glitching isn't too bad. The main issue is it takes a while to load and even when you finally load in, it doesn't necessarily load completely so there's some issues with assets and halting controls, but I have to acknowledge I'm playing on a fairly old gaming laptop, so it might work better for other people.</p>

      <p>I've got a little bit of time into the game now that I feel like I can talk about it. This game is still in development and it shows sometimes with land being collision free and you being able to walk through it. To your player character getting stuck either doing an action or stuck in or on objects, thankfully they added an un-stick button in the menu.

While this game has it's quirks I've only experienced a few of these, most times logging out is the only way to fix it. The game itself has been fun and the story interesting. I've loved the skills system and working on leveling up, my FAVORITE part would have to be the home plat system when you get to build and decorate your entire plot and the home on it.</p>

      <p>It's like a mixture of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, and Zelda. It's very much a grinding quests/gathering materials style of game so it does get a bit repetitive, but it definitely turns your brain off. There are several performance fixes and improvements that could be added to the game, as well as further developing story lines/quests, but overall it's cozy and enjoyable - not to mention free.</p>

      <p>I've played the game for awhile now but... I still can't decide whether it's a good game or not. Surely Palia has many activities and skills to improve, radiant graphics and more or less big world. The NPC are cute too.
But... It lack of something... I've tried to analyze it and I've came to this list:
1. Lack of color. 
It's maybe funny, but Palia, despite of all the cozy landscapes, are mostly in two colors. Green, blue, a little bit of orange. That's all. No more differences. All tree leaves (except the said orange ones) are green. All grass are green. Flowers are rare and hard to notice. I need more colors! More contrast! It's a forest after all, where all the beauty?
2. The claustrophobia thing. 
Your house is located in a place surrounded by fence, by the forest AND by the mountains! Even location outside the city surrounded by the mountains! I know devs are trying to locate the end of the map by that, but PLEASE find another way, it making me sick by all this height above me! You could've add ocean, cliffs, I don't know, CANYONS, but all you choose is rocks. Booriiing! (Oh yeah sorry, forgot about one ocean in one part of the city, my dearest apologies)
3. Maybe lack of realism.
You don't need to sleep, you don't need to eat, you even don't have any health bar. Wolfs are running from you, the night is as bright as a day, I didn't even notice any light sources. What's that, a child game? MAYBE, but no child game are providing killing animals with arrows and harvesting MEAT from it. Even if you try to disguise it with a bag, haha, you think children are stupid? Give adult people more hardcore, I want to feel the game and my character, not just run all day by some created 3D model that has no limits! Even Minecraft has limits (hunger it is)! 

In the end, the game maaaaybe good to relax, but it doesn't provide anything more. You just need to run all day ('cause you don't need to sleep), harvest everything you can and do the quests. Which there a LOT. It feels like I'm on a job and have to work day, and day, and day, and day. The difference is that I receive money by that and here I receive only more quests :D I'm scared to even open my journal, cause it filled by them, but Palia is always reminding me about my job by showing all the quests in a right side of my monitor. It's scary... 

Long story short, it's a game about countless hours of run errands and visibility of freedom. If you tired of doing your real job, you can change it by doing virtual job! Thrilling, isn't it? If you like that assignment, please buy Palia! Otherwise, make your decision by more relaxing games.</p>

      <p>Rating: 5/5

Overview: Palia is a cozy, community-based MMO developed by Singularity 6, blending elements of life simulation and traditional MMORPG gameplay in a relaxing, laid-back environment. It offers an escape from the combat-heavy, fast-paced MMOs and instead focuses on activities like farming, fishing, crafting, and socializing. The game’s whimsical art style, charming world, and emphasis on collaboration over competition set it apart in a genre dominated by high-octane action.

Visuals and Atmosphere: One of the strongest aspects of Palia is its visual presentation. The art style is bright, colorful, and reminiscent of Ghibli films, with lush forests, tranquil lakes, and detailed towns. The characters and environments are beautifully crafted, giving the game a whimsical, warm aesthetic that draws players in. The soundtrack complements this atmosphere perfectly, with gentle, calming music that helps maintain the relaxed pace.

Gameplay: Palia centers around life skills such as cooking, farming, fishing, and crafting. The game doesn't focus on combat or conflict, making it a relaxing experience for those looking for a more casual MMO. Players work together to build homes, gather resources, and complete quests that encourage collaboration rather than competition.

The progression system feels rewarding without being grindy. As players improve their skills, they unlock new recipes, tools, and customization options. The crafting and farming systems are intuitive, and the world provides ample opportunities to explore, gather resources, and discover new areas. However, after several hours, some players may find the gameplay loops repetitive, especially those who are accustomed to more complex MMOs.

Community and Social Features: Palia shines in its social aspect. It encourages players to form friendships and work together on large projects. Community events and co-op activities foster a sense of belonging, and the world is designed to be a shared experience. Players can visit each other’s homes, help with crafting or farming, and participate in large-scale events.

There’s also an emphasis on NPC interactions, with a rich cast of characters to befriend. The dialogue and relationship-building mechanics are engaging, and the NPCs have distinct personalities that make interactions feel meaningful. Romanceable NPCs add a layer of depth, though the relationship system is still somewhat basic in its current form.

Room for Improvement: Despite its charm, Palia isn’t without its flaws. The game could benefit from more content diversity. After mastering the available skills, there’s a lack of end-game content, which could make long-term play feel stagnant. Adding new activities, quests, and crafting options would help sustain interest over time.

Additionally, while the game runs smoothly for the most part, there are occasional bugs and glitches, such as resource spawn issues or server hiccups, which can disrupt gameplay. The developers have been responsive to feedback, so future updates may address these concerns.

Conclusion: Palia is a refreshing, tranquil take on the MMO genre, providing a peaceful, non-combat experience that’s perfect for players seeking a slower-paced, community-driven game. Its cozy aesthetic, focus on social interaction, and simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics make it a joy to play, especially for fans of life simulation games. While it lacks some depth in terms of end-game content, and there’s room for expansion, Palia is a promising and delightful entry into the genre.

If you're looking for an MMO that’s more about building friendships and relaxing than grinding levels or fighting bosses, Palia is worth checking out.</p>

      <p>While I've been having fun playing this game solo (ignoring the bugs and crashes), I can't give it a thumbs up. 
Their marketing team/board members decided to implement some scummy tactics like MACRO transactions, and purchasing a in-game currency, as well as forcing you to buy more of that currency than you need, so you always end up paying more. 

For a game that isn't even finished, this is insane. I wouldn't mind spending like 5eur on a skin, but 40 eur for one outfit or 10 eur for a pet is absolutely insane. Blocking players from earning anything themselves in terms of cosmetics is a major major downside and really greedy. Animal crossing does this in a much better way. 

I would much rather spend 40 euros once to buy the game than spend thousands just trying to buy the cosmetics. That's some EA garbage right there. And its sad because you can see the writers and artists and devs did put a lot of effort into making a cute game.

The multiplayer part also feels very half-a$sed. Yes, theres a chat and you see players running around. You can group up with a friend and see their location. But that's about it. No quest sync, no trading with friends, no mailing friends items, no dungeons or group content, you can't see each other when you're in a temple,  you can't even plant seeds for a friend. what is the point? It seems like the MMO part is just a marketing buzzword. It's about as multiplayer as elden ring is.</p>

      <p>1. There are no horses. Or any other mounts. How is one supposed to have a wholesome farm experience without any horses? 

2. The cooking mini game is the most boring and unsatisfying one i've seen in a game. I wish they'd take notes from Immortal Life, or Kynseed.

3. The quests are few and far between. The world isn't living with no quests.

4. The devs get no profit from designing interesting quests, or writing deep characters. All their profit comes from selling cosmetics on their immersion-breaking store for a lot of money. 

Unless they add some subscription option, I don't expect any quality content to be created. 

More on that:
This game was marketed as wholesome and cozy, with healthy practices. The devs seemed like there was actually some love in the project, and were interested in making a good game for a wholesome, cozy experience. 

The first red flag was the "free to play". No option was even offered to players to buy the game at a fair price, and/or opt to pay for a subscription and then enjoy a complete, immersive world without FOMO, tricks, predatory and stressful microtransactions, and the constant reminder of greed breathing down your neck.

The game doesn't feel wholesome. It feels superficial, and put together for the sole purpose of greed. The microtransactions are integrated in the game, in a way that kills any immersion or wholesomeness one could hope to find in a fantasy world. 

I haven't followed the whole drama, but i did see the trailers and marketing prior to releasing the beta, and trying out the game a year later, it was difficult to imagine that the game in that was marketed was this game i was experiencing. From what I read other people saying online, there's been a lot of drama during that year i missed. Many people blame Palia's devs for lies, unmet promises and a clear indication that this is not the wholesome feel-good game it was marketed to be, just another greedy game with no love in the making whatsoever. 

I guess we'll have to wait a little longer for the real deal. Too bad.</p>

      <p>I love this game BUT right now I can not recommend it, it keeps crashing and freezing!
I ve tried restarting the game, the pc, the wifi, changing configurations, looking at youtube videos about it....every 10 to 15min (or less sometimes) it crashes...
Im hoping that with the next updates the bugs and freezing situation will be corrected and then I will enjoy and recommend the game.
Can`t wait for future updates!</p>

      <p>While this game has many positive aspects, the necessity of idol worship to fulfill a mission is a feature that does not resonate with me. I suggest making the idol worship objectives optional to provide players with more flexibility and choice in their gameplay experience.</p>

      <p>What a game!!! It definitely still has stuff to improve and bugs to be fixed, but the game play style alongside an engaging story that gives you the freedom to progress at your own pace and the social/collaborative nature of the game with fellow members of the server makes those "negatives" almost insignificant.

 If I had to ask for something it would be to give us creative freedom in certain aspects of decoration positioning which might sound like asking too much given the magnitude of improvements that can already be done to our plot. However sometimes the limitations on where an object can be placed or not inside the grid, or the lack of angles, or objects not interacting well with the surroundings do cut us short from the cozy building experience.  It would also be great if we could move the mail box and selling container to anywhere in the plot as it is a bit annoying not been able to change the way the entrance looks.

When playing in a party with a friend, it is often that we lose sight of each other and our friend's character seems to disappear as we run around. The same way our character disappears from our friend's perspective and can result to be confusing as we try to follow each other. There is a serious need of a mini map as well! Having to rely on clicking M to open the big map limits our ability to keep moving as we locate a place. 

Overall the game is super fun whether you have friends to play with or not. The online open multiplayer server allows you to chat with others, ask for help, request needed items for quests or personal use, create a community and make new friends as you discover all the secrets hiding in Palia! Don't let the need for minor fixes in a game that is still in development discourage you from having a wonderful time! The game is totally worth the hype!</p>

      <p>Occasionally buggy, quite often laggy, but it *is* still in beta.

The graphics are decent, it will run on a relatively low-spec machine quite easily, and the style is cute and consistent.

The initial quests are a little repetitive, but once you start to poke into the main story and the NPC stories it becomes very absorbing quite quickly. In fact the writing for some of the NPC stories is absolutely brilliant, as is the animation for certain characters and their body language (all of the NPCs feel well written and well fleshed out, they all have motivations and solid backstories, it's really good in most cases).

There is a certain level of grinding (chop trees, mine rocks, grow crops) but it's on the level of Stardew and it's easy to know what to do. The in-game community is generally friendly and will help out with problems, questions, fetch-quests and so on. A few quests are not very clear about what you need to do at certain points, but again the community will help if they can, and there's a good wiki online with pointers.

It needs some polishing, but there's content updates ongoing and it feels like a game that should be brilliant by the time it hits full release.</p>

      <p>Lovely game that scratches the Stardew/Sandrock cozy itch with a fun and kind fantasy world. This is one of the most co-operative games I've ever played with quests, gathering, and cooking encouraging you to play with others to enjoy bonuses for everyone. I never felt the need to pay for any cosmetics, and many of them you can get for free through achievements and quests.

For a free game, I can recommend trying it to anyone who likes cozy games and enjoys playing games with others.</p>

      <p>Tried it with ma lil cousin, looked cozy and all and we promised us a cozy Building/exploring game from it with some quest, but well, its is a building and exploring game. With a TINY map, weird quests and boring npcs, no real game mechanics or story whatsoever and maybe , just maybe we would have tried it a bit more if we wouldnt have fallen trough the ground all the time, or just randomly being able to walk out of bounds and leave the map due to everything losing its collisions. It seems and feels like a weird and buggy mobile game and i do not recommend. Oh and did i mention you need to give em your email to play?! yeah, not recommended</p>

No pay to play or frequent 'resting' required, either! Just consume food or meals to restore energy. Only transactions are purely for cosmetic purposes. I've only been playing for roughly a week and enjoy this game immensely :D</p>

      <p>I absolutely love this game. This game is so pretty, refreshing, and extremely cozy. Plus! It's free-to-play! The only time you have to spend "real money" is when you purchase clothing, tool skins, glider skins, and animal creatures,, etc...from the Premium shop. Which honestly, is such a sigh of relief. 

I'm so exhausted of buying battle passes, event passes...anything passes; where it stops being free-to-play and becomes more FOMO-enraging. There are some items I can no longer get in Palia, and I'm fine for now. I'm hoping Palia will re-release some skins if there is another opportunity to get them. Especially with newer players joining up now. 

Gardening is so much fun, and decorating my home is on another level. 

I think so far the only con I have about the game is I wish there was more to do. I also wish you can craft the modification item to change the color of furniture. I really dislike running all the way to kilima village and purchasing them at tish's shop to then going alllllllll the way back home. Two loading screens later, I just sigh cause it takes so much time.</p>

      <p>Let me start this out by saying I love this game when it works properly, but ever since the .184 update the game crashes constantly and it is always glitching out in someway whether that's game play or causing other things like my keyboard or controller to stop responding. I don't play with any mods and I play on PC so I don't feel like there should be constant issues with the game like there is. Very disappointing.</p>

      <p>i don't want to start this review out with "for a free to play game" because I genuinely think this game has a lot to offer and is a lot of fun even if it was a paid experience, but truly the value is more than worth it as a F2P game. i was really hesitant about that at first, but i've been playing it pretty regularly since the public beta released last year. there's definitely flaws, but the monetization in my opinion is tasteful and largely non-obtrusive, the game progression is satisfying and engaging, and while it's very clearly inspired by other games it's more than the sum of its parts. there's a lot of charm and love to be found in the game and i haven't gotten bored of it after several hundred hours. would definitely recommend, you lose nothing by checking it out. :)</p>

      <p>Palia is a fantastic game that I've played mostly off steam, I stopped playing after a couple months and have recently come back. There are a lot of great new changes mostly revolving around the game being more friendly to get rare resources. 

There is loads of things to do and to grind for, with a huge focus on community and player friendship. Over the year there still aren't many "new" things to do or new zones which does mean that the game gets stale still a year later after playing it for a week or so in a row.

One thing that's a really big negative that almost made me change my review is that there are a lot of community rules that aren't stated anywhere other than in the brains of the people who follow them and/or have played long enough to know them, Not knowing these rules such as Cutting flow tree groves at 3am in game time caused a large argument on the server today with me cutting too early, I did not know and wasn't told but broke some scared rule that caused a player to hurl abuse at me over chat for 20 mins. 

If the community is going to create rules that are expected to be followed the developers should perhaps put these into the in game loading screens or tool-tips once they become expected. 

I've had these negative experiences with more players then I'd expect to for a game that at it's core is a "Cozy MMO".

Other then this the game is really nice and the community as a whole has be wonderful.</p>

      <p>Cute and cozy game. The story and the characters are really interesting! Plus, the team seems to be pretty active on feedback.

The only thing that bugs me is being forced to increase friendship with some characters in order to increase the friendship level with only one. There are some characters I can't really stand and it makes me sick talking to them, let alone being friendly.</p>

      <p>I can't believe this game is free. Everything from the world to the characters, graphics and story is so well done. Gameplay provides plenty of variety. You can collect insects, do combat, or focus on gathering and building if you so please, something that I've wished more games like this would offer. You can even build friendships and romance the other characters. This game truly has it all. Not a huge fan of having to pay for cosmetics and skins rather than earning them though. The one major gripe that I have with the game however, is the fact that it's online only. As others have said, this game really doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer game. The servers don't seem to be too populated and the socialization between other players is nearly nonexistent aside from a few people sharing tips here and there. I think it would've been a better idea to make the game singeplayer and give those who wish to play with others the ability to create a server that others can join, similar to Palworld and Genshin, that way players don't have to rely on being connected to wifi to be able to play. The game truly doesn't need to be multiplayer in my opinion. Aside from that though, it would also be nice to have the ability to sit in chairs and benches as others have said.</p>

      <p>Game tries hard to create community in a kid-friendly environment.  I like that it's free to play, but you can support the game by buying crazy outfits and tool skins.  I also like that there's no PVP or competition against other players, and you can gain benefits by cooperating with others.</p>

      <p>Surprisingly pretty in-depth game for a free to play game that isn't even technically finished yet. I'm honestly pretty impressed. As a big fan of simple cozy games, this game has definitely pulled me in. I'm excited to see what's to come in the future.
Only real gripe so far is just that I wish there were at least some options outside of the premium store to buy clothes and whatnot as I'm not the biggest fan of the base game clothes personally. On the other hand, as long as cosmetics are the only microtransactions, I can't complain too much.</p>

      <p>This game has been my life for the past month and a half. All of my free time goes into Palia either by hunting, foraging, mining, fishing, gardening, decorating my plots, completing npc/storyline quests, romancing npcs, or playing the addicting game of hot pot. You can collect plushies, and all the star quality fish, bugs, and starstones to display in your house for others to see. The community of players are super friendly and helpful to those who are new to the game. And I love how Palia implements the use of "teamwork"(what I refer to it as) where you can party with others to get the same drops from hunting or foraging. Not to mention the use of having flow trees that require multiple players to chop in order to obtain it's wood. There is an endless amount of things to do in this game, all at your own pace. So if you love mmorpgs, farming games, and a nice, relaxing game to hop on after a long day, Palia is definitely for you! :)</p>

It is easy to pick up and the progression is really satisfying but not too easy, it is the perfect balance of grinding/economy to progress which I enjoy. It is free while in Beta so there is no reason not to download it and try it out! The community is incredibly friendly and the game is built to enhance community.</p>

      <p>It's been a while since a game caught my attention like this one! What a incredible game, beautiful scenario, smooth gameplay, actual fun mechanics - I think I spent half hour fishing and it wasn't even boring. Other mechanics like mining or building stuff reminds me of palworld/osrs but without the boredom that comes with those games.

Everything is so nice in this game, NPCs and people are kind. As a former league player I'm surprised that this is actually possible. Oooh the NPC dialogs are so fun! I enjoy reading the quests storylines. I feel connected to them, they are not generic as most of MMOs out there (go to point A take item X deliver to point B).

The game reminds you of drinking water IRL and the other messages are very kind/positive. 

What a gem. I literally have no dislikes for this game, and I feel that my 2.5 gameplay hours will soon become 250 hours xD</p>

I feel like I'm always working towards something but without feeling overwhelmed. Also, this community is so friendly and informative, I haven't really seen any gatekeeping at all. I've become more confident in asking questions in chat or participating in group activities despite being a pretty shy person. It always gives me a sense of community and accomplishment whenever I join in a group and do something like gathering flow tree wood and lures.</p>

It's amazing what people are doing with their spaces - absolute artistry. Best of all, it's largely a supportive and collaborative community (with few exceptions). It's truly free to play - the cute outfits and skins  that are paid for are for show only and completely optional.

With its amazing variety of things to do and the decidedly less violent take on social gaming it caters to those more inclined to less violence and/or women like me that couldn't care less about all the rampant PvP out there in gaming today.

      <p>Let me start with the fact that the game is FREE. There are a couple of in-game purchases possible, but they are only cosmetic. They do not further your progress or boost gameplay in any way.

74 hours in the game and I love it. Farming, fishing, hunting, questing, playing with randoms, and the slight chance for a group activity in the forest.

There are a couple things here and there that I would like to change like the number of crop plots available, or transportation, but these are things that need to be in the game for balance.

To the developers and community, thank you for making a laid back game like this possible for anyone to play regardless or language, age, or region. Would highly recommend to anyone that wants to play a non-competative, laid-back game with little to no conciquences.</p>

      <p>I'm obsessed with this game. So recommend this game to others. No stress just something to relax to and play. Make your home, add decor and build a garden, go fishing and hunting. Go on adventures and solve Puzzles and Mysteries . Very Cozy game. Yes, there's some issues at times like falling through some grounds but it's still in the Beta stages and they're working on it I believe, but ways to fix it I just restart the game or go home and easy fix. That can be frustrating a bit but I still love playing this game and can't wait for more updates and see where it goes.</p>

      <p>Overall it is a decent game, I really like the Glider and some of the Tasks are like Hunting are kind of neat, however, it is a Beta, and you can tell has some items are not finished yet, or they have plans for them in the future. Reading Discord and other Forums, it seems they are slow to add any real expansion and have only added visual content since the Beta Release. The Update today even speaks of "bringing back", instead of "look at all the new content".

There are things you will wish you knew before you spend any Real World Cash, like buying the Plot Backgrounds, because you only get 2 free Plots, and it is the most expensive thing in game to have to purchase. I spent $80 in RWC, to find out that I still will have to work, virtually forever, to get the in-game Coin to purchase the additional Plots to show off my $80 investment in the game.

I do not like that it is similar to a Browser Game, in that every time you purchase a Plot Item, the price goes up, SIGNIFICANTLY. You get NOTHING better, bigger or new, in fact, you only have 2 Main House Options even available, right now. Browser Games sell In-Game Coin for Real World Cash, but you cannot purchase Coin in this game.

I am holding out hope that it grows and expands in the very near future, but I am still having fun, and there are some neat ways to decorate that are keeping me busy, for now.</p>

It's like you're in a whole different world. The only thing I don't like is the limit on decorating, but overall, it's really great.</p>

      <p>If we could get dots on the map to guide us to our specific location, that'd be great. I'm dyslexic and that would really help. Also, the buttons are hard to navigate. I'm not able to place items easily. I'm not sure how to look items up easily. I don't know how to check if my character is hungry or not. I'm new to playing this style of video game. I love the scenery. It's very beautiful. If the player can figure out the buttons, it's a pretty good game. I'm not sure if I got this game for free. My Husband got it for me and I just play under his/our Steam account.</p>

      <p>One of the best gaming communities I've ever encountered. Players call out and mark rare spawns of ore, trees, plants and critters and wait for others to arrive. There's a gifting system where players help each other out with items they have had in the past but need now.  You can decorate your home plot with thousands of items from drops to different buildings and recently added building blocks. I've seen fortresses, castles and custom homes. There are bugs like any other EA game. The cash shop is a bit overpriced IMO, but only contains companion pets, cosmetics and skins so nothing in the shop is mandatory to buy to enjoy the game.</p>

This is a great way to kill an hour at time or a whole day at a time in. Absolutely worth playing. Also, the in-game money shop is not in your face and strictly sells things of a cosmetic nature.

      <p>Palia is a beautiful world. The game play is fun, exciting and engaging. No violence (unless you consider killing a couple of wild animals for food and stuff, But no fighting opponents on other humanoids). The crafting is very skilled, however the only negative I have is the monetary system is a bit skewed. I think the cost for items are way to high. The mmo environment is very friendly and helpful. Loving the game so far.</p>

Would like to see more quests regarding world expansion\discovery (I am on the wait for quest to continue) and there is a path that just ends from Kilima. Is this possibly another location in development? Another game where players can play games against each other would be cool.</p>

      <p>This game is a nice slow pace cozy chill game to just relax and play over time. The interactions with the npc's are fun and refreshing when their dialog changes depending on how you answer their questions. It is refreshing and more dynamic. The grind portion is not easy but it puts you in a slow pace to take it slow and relax. It has great creation dynamics to allow many possibilities to make your land unique for yourself. The main in game purchase is purely cosmetical but the entire gameplay itself is free and refreshing from games that are either pay to play or games that make you pay to get items. the prices are not unreasonable and prices for items with in game gold scales to how much money you should be making at that time using your level for each area to keep a want to work on skills but is not a full requirment to gatekeep from progressing. As well this game is great both solo and multiplayer in a very helpful community. The crossplatform progression is also a nice detail that works very smoothly.

Game function flaws would be an occasonal crashs if multiple programs are running, only once but a flaw with the character appearing diffrent from original, most bugs were more so able to fix quickly.</p>

      <p>I love this game so much. The cozy farm sim vibes are immaculate, the MMO aspects are a delight, but most of all, the characters are so complex and lovable. I genuinely enjoy *every single* NPC in this game, which is not something I have ever felt about another farm sim (despite having played a LOT of them!). I have literally cried over the back story and trauma some of these characters have shared with me, especially because the writing in the dialogue often is so well-written that it feels clear that it must have come from writers who truly empathized or had even experienced some of those things. I just adore this game and can't believe that it's free and being updated so regularly. I can't wait to see what Palia holds in store for us in the future!</p>

The multiplayer features make the game feel unqiue and the community is very kind toward new players. Since it is still in beta at the time of writing there are occasional bugs but the dev team is very responsive.</p>

      <p>This game could cost money and Id buy it. Plain and simple, its a relaxing game with no constraints yet so much to do with each day. Probably the BEST community of gamers I have ever run into in a mmo style game. Customization is amazing. Building is amazing. Hot Pot in the sewers.. you guessed it...amazing. Highly recommend if you're looking for a cozy game to dump a lot of time into. 10/10</p>

      <p>It crashed so many times that I gave up trying to play this game.  It is a cute concept but does not work on my system, and most games don't crash or give my system any issues. 

It seemed well done but again does not work consistently for me.  I tried three times to uninstall and reinstall.  It crashes every single time I try to play it.  I only made it to level 2 before I had to give up.  I would love to play this and stay in the world with less frustration so I plan to keep an eye on reviews and see what bug fixes come along, and who knows, maybe I will update my  system although it shouldn't be obsolete just  yet.</p>

      <p>100% love this game. It's so good and I'm happy to buy the cosmetics just to support the devs! Hours and hours of fun and wonderful people to play with, it's perfect. 

My biggest complaint is the storage space. 8 chests, even upgraded, is nowhere near enough when you get to late game. I greatly appreciate stuff like furniture not taking up space, but that is kind of expected since you can't sell it, which also sucks.

And the other main complaint is that the controller support, while functioning and decent, it's still not great yet. Many features still require you to use your keyboard and sometimes the controller functions stop working for 1 button, like jumping or sprinting which can be frustrating if you are trying to do a jumping puzzle. 

Also the last tiny complaint is that trying to set up the kitchen stuff is a nightmare. It will tell you that you don't have a stove when you have 2. What it means is you don't have a stove that you havn't unlocked yet. It took me so long to figure this out for petit fives that it means the NEXT step up from a stove that you initially start with. It was hours of headache and just sucked.

Otherwise I really do enjoy playing Palia, I just hope with further work and additions that the storage, kitchen and controller's features will improve.</p>

      <p>loved the game but the fast travel is bad. The fact that you can't fast travel from your house to a region means long tedious sprinting to the nearest fast travel point. The scenery is beautiful but going back and forth in the same path is not fun and i would like to explore the other places that the game devs loving created. 3.5 Stars but great potential for a special game i will return Later.</p>

Not to mention the ability to party up with others and make friends! I spent about 4 hours last night in a party collecting just about everything we could and just talking and getting to know eachother.

      <p>Stardew Valley + 3D + MMO. Just a super chill game with no competition, which is what I love about it! You can take your sweet time to do whatever you feel like doing that day (farming, gathering, hunting, working on your house decorations, complete bundles, etc) at your own pace. 

The fact that you can also team up with your friends for various activities such as cooking and it gives everyone the dish in the end is great!</p>

      <p>love this game. everything looks and feels amazing when playing it have no issues with it crashing like other games and there is always something to do.

Downfall is that there are no shared plots yet with friends and it feels more like a solo player game than a multiplayer one. I usually only need people with the flow trees. Some sort of player based shop would be cool as well.</p>

      <p>Palia is quite possibly the best game I've played. Beautiful graphics, gorgeous world, immersive characters and story line. This game has something for everyone, with questing, farming, romance, foraging, hunting, fishing, cooking, you name it! And it's free! Sure, there's a premium shop, but those are purely aesthetic options. This is NOT a pay-to-play game <3 I will recommend this game until I die. It's perfect for your kid, you, and your great-great grandpa, too. 

Now I will say that this game IS still in beta, and I've seen glitches, lag, etc, but they're constantly improving and fixing with regular patches and updates during the development process. 

Also, I know as of writing this it's saying I've only played for 5 hours, but I've put in countless hours on the game before it came to steam, and on my switch (where it's fully playable without a Nintendo online sub).</p>

      <p>Palia is a cozy game with beautiful character animations and a relaxing vibe. Playing with friends is fun, but it would be even better if we could actually build and grow our farms together instead of just visiting each other. It’d also be nice if villagers could live with you if you are in a relationship with them, like in Stardew Valley.

The biggest downside is the lack of clothing crafting. You can craft everything else and level up skills, but clothes have to be bought. It feels like a missed opportunity, especially with Jel’s shop already in place. Still, Palia has potential!</p>

      <p>I've been playing Palia for a few months now, and I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, being an MMO, which I had deliberately stayed away from for years. However, this is unlike any MMO I've ever played before. There is no combat, no enemies, and group play is highly encouraged. There is also no player economy, only that between you and the NPCs. 

Main Goals: Building your dream home in your own housing plot is the ultimate goal. And this is actually where the game starts you off. The quests are definitely worth doing for both the story line and the rewards. They opens up parts of the game you wouldn't be able to access otherwise, and many of the rewards include decor items absolutely worth having. Building friendships with the NPCs is equally important, and very similar to Stardew Valley, Garden  Paws, and the My Time at Portia game series, among others, I'm sure. The rewards for these in Palia, though, feel much more rewarding. 

Group play: playing in parties has its perks; everyone gets the same loot as long as you're within a certain range of one another. However, it's not completely necessary. If you and another player hit the same rock, node, tree, game animal, etc., at the same time, you both contribute to "tagging" it, and you both get loot. Fishing has a bonus, too, when fishing near other players.

Gifting: Another aspect of group play, in regards to player economy is the gifting system. There's no trading, such as between players directly or in a party, (though this has been heavily requested), but you can request items through the social tab and another player can gift it to you that way. And to help mitigate abuse of this system, there is a daily cap on how many times you can request items.

The Material Grind: This is similar to other games in that you still have to do it almost constantly, and the rarer materials, such as Palium ore, and other foraging items, make it that much more of a grind. However, group play, in parties, or just running round with other players, and call-outs to these rare locations in chat help to make this easier. There are only two main map areas at this time, as well, and certain materials are restricted to each location respectively. There is also fishing and bug catching, and both have nice perks, which I won't spoil here.

Food and Crops: You have your crops you grow in your housing plot, both for selling and for making food. The food provides what the game calls "focus" which gives you a boost to XP while in the world farming materials and while crafting. Food and focus are both important. 

Making Money: Fish, bugs, and extra crops will be your primary money makers in the beginning. Extra crafting materials are also good money makers in later game. Crafted decor items cannot be sold, but they also do not take up inventory space in your chests. 

Communities: This is Palia's equivalent of Guilds. However, it's still a work in progress. There's not much to do in Communities yet, but I hear that it's getting a face-lift, so I'm excited to see what's coming for communities. Hopefully this also includes a Community Plot and daily goals. 

Overall I absolutely recommend this game, whether you're a seasoned MMO player, or new to MMOs, or just looking for casual group or individual play. Since there's no combat system and everyone shares materials in the world, this eliminates most of the game stress you get from more competitive MMOs. And if you do feel stressed, or need time alone, you can simply spend hours in your housing plot building your very own palace!</p>

      <p>If you dislike games with a lot of bugs, don't play this. because you will break the game multiple times, with even the "unstuck" button not working. 
If you can see past that, it's a great MMORPG style game, where you can build and decorate your own plot of land, venture off and discover the land, solve puzzles, and befriend characters and other players.</p>

      <p>Palia is a simple, cozy, kinda an MMO but only One (1) character per account sort of game. It's 100% f2p, and though there is a shop, it's not there for anything except cosmetics. It's pretty easy to pick up on, though I will forewarn that you should look into what the "personality signs" are and mean as sooooon as possible. It has a sprinkling of romance in the game, but honestly it's fluff. So if this sounds good to you, it's for you. ;-}</p>

      <p>stardew valley, animal crossing and breath of the wild just had a baby and it's named Palia

a wonderfully engaging game, full of life and lore that is free to explore at your own pace! the skills you pick up are frequently called upon with the quests, tying all the gameplay elements together in such an ingenious way that you can't help but spend all day totally lost in palia

i'm not sure if there's enough i can say about this game except give it a spin! at the time of writing, the game is still in beta (i believe) and it does show with some unexpected jank, but it's mainly in the MMO aspect of it-- the underlying world is largely polished and free to explore without issue!</p>

      <p>Cost/Value: For this being free to play, it is amazing the things you can do. The only thing where you would use real-life money is for outfits, skins for your tools etc. Personally, there are a lot of outfits to choose from... but the outfits and things you can buy are really cool.

Complexity: The game isn't complex, I feel this game would be suitable for any age.. however, there is relationship building in the game and i am unsure if it goes to SIMS lvl of relationships.

Type of game: Casual MMO, similar vibes to Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley with fortnite graphics. Difference is that it has quests, and there is no health bar... so it's quite fun being able to jump off a hill because you are too lazy to run down it.

Overall: This game is quite fun, there is no pressure to do anything, however, the storyline and quests are fun!</p>

I really appreciate that I was able to link my account from Switch so I could keep my progress, such a great feature. As far as the game itself, there is soooo much to do in this game. The music, the graphics, the quests, home building, etc are all enjoyable. This is a go-to game for me when I'm looking for something creative and enjoyable to do.

      <p>I’ve only been playing for a couple of months, but I can already tell, that this will be one of those games, that will always have a special place in my heart! 

I have a lot of fun with the different quests in this game, and actually feel like I have a “connection” with the NPC’s. I’m normally not a huge fan of grinding for materials in games, but for some reason I really enjoy it in Palia, and can spend hours just running around grinding for the different materials. 

I also really love the multiplayer aspect of the game. It’s such a fun game to play with friends, and I’ve already made so many friends through this game! Even without playing with friends, the multiplayer aspect is great. (Most) people in this game are so sweet and helpful, and it’s such a nice feeling to never feel alone when playing Palia.

I will say that the prices for the premium clothes and accessories is way too expensive, and the free clothes in this game are very limited. I’m happy that nothing else is locked behind a paywall, but I’m really hoping to see some better prizing of the premium stuff in the future.

If you are not a mouse and keyboard player, I would suggest being it for this game. As of right now, controller support is really not that great.</p>

They have created such a great system for safe online gaming from what I've experienced, and I even feel comfortable suggesting this game to my little sister because I have seen and experienced the supportive and respectful community. There are so many creative opportunities to build your dream house if you so desire, the storyline is well done and captivating. This game sucks you in in the best way and is almost therapeutic for me. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who loves the Sims, Minecraft, and any MMORPG with a cozy feel.</p>

      <p>It's hard to believe this game is in early access/beta with how polished it already feels. The ten hours I've played so far passed by with very little feeling of grinding. Cheerful NPCs, bright colors, and constant progress give a much needed serotonin boost to my poor 9-5er brain. Check it out because it's free, stay because it's well-made and thought out. Consider buying some cosmetics (it's the only thing you can buy in-game) and thank the devs!</p>

      <p>I WANT to recommend this game. However, doing so would be setting others up for disappointment.

This game has the potential to be one of the most comfortable and relaxing MMOs to have ever been made. I truly mean that. But in order to do that it would need to be developed by an entirely new team/company, probably. 

The issues:
1. The game is so filled to the brim with glitches and game-breaking bugs that they NEVER should have even considered it past alpha. The ground will vanish. The menus will bug out. The NPCs are almost nonfunctional. The quests will bug out. The list is actually so long I won't bother. Just know that the game BARELY functions. 

2. The optimization of the game is ATROCIOUS. You can run all the way to the center of the (only) town in the game and the buildings will STILL be popping into existence one wall at a time with 20 second intervals between them. The town is TINY! How?! It's truly horrid.

3. This is the one that pisses me off. The thing that makes me unwilling to be patient with this anymore is that they continue to push out CONSTANT updates. "For what?" you may ask. 

[h1] IN-GAME PURCHASES and MICROTRANSACTIONS BAAAABBYYYYY [/h1] 

It's the ONLY THING they care AT ALL about. They make it more and more clear as they keep releasing more real-money skins into the game. (Funny too because even these are bugged as hell. They glitch into themselves and look just truly terrible.)

My wife and I have played a lot of this game. (Mostly on Switch...which...lol don't bother...) We really were loving the comfortable relax vibes as we tried to wind down at the end of the evening. But the game has become steadily more unplayable and just filled to the brim with microtransactions. 

Want this game to succeed? Fire the team making these decisions and get better programmers. Until then this looks like a cash grab of the laziest nature. 

Edit just to add: If you try to bring up any of your concerns with this game to it's community you will be shouted down and removed from any of their communities you bring it up in. It doesn't matter how civil you try to be about it when expressing genuine concerns. For such a cozy game and a (normally) super positive community they DO NOT like when you ask questions like 'Why are the buildings not loading in anymore?" I don't understand the zealous nature of the defense of this particular game by its players but it's kind of weird.</p>

      <p>Do you like Breath of the Wild and wish it were multiplayer and more laid back? Do you like Animal Crossing and wish to have more freedom with how you place your decor? Do you enjoy farm sim games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, or Fields of Mistria and wish it were a 3D title instead?

Then allow me to introduce you to Palia!

Currently in Beta and free to play with cosmetic options for those who like some icing on the cake, Palia is perfect for anyone who wants a casual farm sim/adventuring MMO with low stakes and a lot of heart. It's very forgiving in terms of game play, where even in situations where you can die, death is not a huge setback. This is a boon to those who aren't talented in platforming, which is an aspect of the game critical to advancing the main story quest line.

Another aspect of this game I specifically enjoy are the characters. They're beautifully rendered, and every single npc has something going on. From the hard-on-their-luck farming family, to the mayor's dysfunctional home, the variety and intricacies of the social circles in Palia fascinate me. As someone who yearns for variety in character design, this game is a breath of fresh air. I only wish the dating pool in Palia were a bit broader!

As this game is still in beta, there are some areas of the game that could use improvement. As previously mentioned, I would enjoy seeing more bachelors and bachelorettes added to the roster. Sifuu, Ashura, and Zeki come to mind. Yes, even though some people might find them abrasive. Okay, this includes Eloise and Caleri too. Could be fun romance paths, after all.
Another aspect I have found a little frustrating is that sometimes, quests aren't clear about the next step to take. I understand this can be used to encourage exploring. When it works, quests feel like they have a snowballing effect that's naturally rewarding. Being stymied because an objective was just a little too obtuse (and don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of point and click adventure games so obtuse solutions aren't a deal breaker for me) can be a turn off. Hopefully the devs smooth this part out a bit. I can see it negatively impacting gameplay for some folks.

Let's wrap this up with talking about the building aspect. Progression through crafting trees are fairly straightforward: gather materials, craft, invent (or buy) new recipes, and repeat. Progress rarely feels like a grind. Although there are some aspects that make a player slow down, such as when items are in a smelter or other materials processing, I find it balances out so you're freed up to go out into the world again.

TL:DR; Great casual social game for folks who like farm sims with a little bit of intrigue. I think I'll be playing this one for hundreds of hours into the future.</p>

      <p>Fun and exciting game play and story line. Some glitches but that's to be expected with beta testing. Some things that I wish could be added were 1. more facial feature characterization options. Right now the facial features are limited into the selection of head shape (choosing a head shape comes with eyes, nose and lips already pre-selected with that particular head shape). It would be nice to be able to choose your own eyebrow shape, eye shape, lip shape, etc. 2. Another thing that was hard for me to adjust to was trying to find people for quests. It might be nice to add a hint of when said person would out in the time of day or where to look for them. Granted most people you talk to who send you to go look for someone will tell you, but I can't tell you how many times I went looking for Hodori not being able to find him on the map. Which leads me to my next suggestion. 3. It would be nice to have a visual in-game other than the compass above the screen. Like a trail of mystical glitter to follow when you set a way-point. These are honestly my only pet peeves and they are small but the way-point one was very frustrating for me. I have ADHD and Autism so my brain gets easily distracted but wants to find the fastest route which sometimes makes it take longer to find someone--and the more I mess up the more overstimulated I become because I can't find what I'm looking for. It just makes for a not fun internal situation I have to handle over something someone who doesn't struggle with what I do might not. Definitely a fun game that I look forward to seeing the further development of and see how things unfold.</p>

      <p>Although a little buggy it is a lovely experience. I love the NPCs and the world building and I end up just getting sucked into the game play for hours.

One of the best free to play games I've experienced - there are some micro-transactions but they are purely cosmetic and you can play the game just fine without them!

100% would recommend!</p>

      <p>Palia is probably the coziest of cozy games with a world that's rich in lore but not quite fully fleshed out yet, but with each update usually comes new content that adds to the world's lore. I like to think of it as a cross between games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. There's plenty of skills to learn and master, tools to upgrade, and achievements to be had. Partying up is the best way to play this game not only because it's fun, but with more people, you reap more rewards. It's free to play too with the optional cosmetic purchases for your character and your plot, so if you're interested, definitely give it a whirl. You might find that you very much enjoy it.</p>

      <p>Its a fun and addictive game. My first ever, 'cozy', type of game, so mostly just building up life skills and running quests. 

Leveling up your skills of course gets tougher the more you level up, so there is quite a bit of grind, especially if you add in grinding for money. 

The climbing system can be a bit glitchy and can be frustrating when trying to climb something but your character pulls out their glider instead. 

Community seems friendly and I appreciate the etiquette when it comes to chopping down flow trees and/or palium. The server always seems to be active, so you never really feel like you're playing alone (which is something I liked about Once Human, but that game appears to have died).

Not bad for a free game. Apparently the last big update had more to do with adding more cash shop items than it did actually fixing bugs and improving QOL issues, so take it for what its worth. At the end of the day, the only color that makes the world spin is green!</p>

      <p>Great game if you're into the harvesting, crafting, and platforming parts of mmo's   The game is free and you pay for cosmetics which Is a good model, I bought stuff just to show support    The NPCs all have names, jobs, and homes so you have to build relationships with them (which is pretty simple and the menu tells you what to do)   The whole game is pretty "kumbaya": doing things together with other people boosts your xp, if you're missing some crafting components you can send a request to everyone on the server easily and unobtrusively (it's honestly pretty well thought out) But basically this is that nin-tenda farming simulator game with the animals crossed with fortn!te and WoW graphics.  Its free!</p>

      <p>15 minutes in the game session, the game freezes and I am not able to turn it off and need to restart my PC.
Lowered the settings to low and it still does it.

Otherwise I love the estetics of the game and would like to play mroe of it but I still have not passed the introductionarry part with setting your house because of all the crashing after a total of 2 hours of playtime.

Idit: i was able to play more of it, the story is interesting and it got me invested in it.
The crafting is really nice and you have a grid that makes placing really easy.
The game have a big potential, but it needs a bit of optimisation and maybe some more content.</p>

      <p>As someone who enjoys repetition it has been extremely easy to hit that 1k hr mark of playtime. The game gives me Animal Crossing NH vibes in the similar ways that I catch bugs, fish, garden, gather rss, decorate and even build relationships with the npcs. I have completed the story up to where it currently is and though I know a lot of people want more, as do I, I understand the game is still very early on in its development with a fairly small team. The devs are pretty transparent with what's going on at any given time (they are pretty active on their discord). Between twitch drops and event gifts from the studio there has been a fair amount of additional items given to players that I think are a nice touch. Though there are glitches and bugs that happen with every patch, updates are fairly regular imo with one pretty much monthly that adds a decent amount of features plus fixes to the game. Considering it's a free game it is hard to argue that it's not worth it, even if you only play until the current content runs out, I think the overall design of the game and gameplay will draw back existing players as the game expands (elderwoods etc). It has been fun to meet some cool people through the game too since it is so socially driven. I also enjoy streaming it and watching other streamers play it, I think there is a lot of potential for big group events within communities who play together (though party limit is currently 4).</p>

      <p>As far as I understand, Palia is still in Beta. I usually wait for games to be fully released before playing them but I was craving something cozy and had heard good things about the game.

I'm happy I gave Palia a shot because it's exactly what I was looking for. Yes, the game is slow and grindy but there is no need to rush things. You can just go out, chop some trees, mine some ores, cook up some food - it's just really relaxing.</p>

There's eight categories you level up with the help of a mentor for each skill you do. It's Open-World and the Best Part about Palia is that it's FREE. It was originally on Switch, but now it's available on PC through Steam and  that's Awesome. Thank you.</p>

      <p>Very fun, engaging, and relaxing game that is hard to stop playing. Similar games can not compete with Palia. The game is well balanced, has easy and fun features to use, and nearly endless room for creativity. Exploring Palia and playing with friends is easy, fun, and even has it bonuses. There are so many neat aspects to the game, it feels like you are playing multiple A+ games. I hope they continue adding to this game because the formula they have here is perfect.</p>

      <p>I've played this game in alpha and before the beta was open for everyone. I fell out of for about year. Came back after craving farming. This game is still worked on so if you're like me when you do come back there's something new to do. I was worried that this game was abandon but no! there's way more players than I remember playing with before. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. Especially when cutting down flow trees. 

I play on pc and switch. This game is pretty easy to go back and forth with which is really nice. Both have their pros and con. Switch I find cooking, and fishing to be easier to do. While I find on pc hunting and bug catching easier. My switch is older so it doesn't run that well graphics wise with this game but I take that L if it means I can lay down playing before bed. 
 
The only money you can spend on this free game is on outfits. I respect the hustle and if you got to make money somewhere that's the best case. 

My only complaint is I find getting the rare fish and bugs for the bundles quest hard to fulfilled. If it wasn't for looking up wiki's I wouldn't have gotten as far as I have so far. I'm still missing more of the fish. Feels bad man.</p>

      <p>The only surprising thing about Palia is that it is free to play. It is a very lighthearted, visually pleasing game with plenty to do. I feel so relaxed whether I am completing quests or taking care of my plot.

With the game being free to play it only makes sense you would have in-app transactions on custom skins. That's where things get expensive - I can't justify spending $40 for two skins, but that's just me. It may be nice to offer an option of purchasing new gear and clothes with in-game currency. but their selection with the game is still plenty when you consider how much value you are getting for free. recommend.</p>

      <p>This game is great, and it's free! It's a super cozy game where your character fosters relationships with the villagers and develops skills to build up a personal housing plot. There is a main story quest, and the NPCs have their own quest story lines to follow. The writing is very cute, and pretty much everything in the game just screams positive vibes.

There are a lot of bugs in the game, but the developers stay transparent about things they're working on. For a free game, I don't feel like I can complain too much! The main bugs I've personally run into are clipping through the environment at times. Nothing a quick reload didn't fix and I was back to chatting up Hodari!</p>

      <p>One of the most relaxing steam games to play. I play this game quite often when I'm bored and I've managed to put in over 200 hours while exploring, hunting, fishing, and building my house and farm. The game has surprisingly a lot to do considering its a free game with the only in-game purchases being cosmetic. I have to say, in the MMO aspect of the game, you might not find yourself interacting much with other people, but when you do the community is nice and will help you out if you need guidance. DEFINETLY worth your time if you play games like Stardew Valley or Animal crossing, its got a similar cozy feeling to it so I wholeheartedly have to recommend this game.</p>

      <p>I wouldn't recommend this game just yet. Its a great idea and i can see it being fun for majority of people (personally not my type of game, pretty much for little kids and should have stayed on switch). However, here's my problems with it:

- To actually login to make a Palia account (if u decide to), you need to change a few keys. Even when using a PC layout it didn't recognise the mouse or keyboard. If you're on steam deck, it is playable but the controls are weird af.

- Character customisation is buggy, constantly changing for example a characters shirt even though u didn't click anything. This made the process longer.

- Game play at first was attractive, but past that first stage, its rather boring. There's nothing attractive other than it being apparently a cozy game. I want missions and the ability to do whatever but the tutorial is long af, unoriginal characters, long and generic conversations, and...no..its boring.</p>

      <p>It really is a nice game. It's free to play and does not pester you with sales and dubious offers. Gameplay is fun. There is no combat (afaIk), and skill progression is smooth. You can talk to villagers, fulfill quests and become friends. There is a main story, but there is no urgency to it. Basically, you can just collect resources and build a nice little home. The map is big enough to allow some exploring, yet small enough to constantly see other players. I think that the co-op aspect could still be fleshed out a little. Other than playing some mini-games or gathering resources even quicker, there does not seem to be much benefit to working together right now.</p>

      <p>TL;DR: If you can look past some heavy, heavy bugs, the game's surprisingly deep writing and elaborate systems make it a charming, absorbing experience.

I had been playing for about 4 hours when I feel under a house; something about the steps not loading correctly. The unstuck function did nothing, neither did restarting the game. Luckily, the map has a teleporting function that I could use to return home and, next time I wandered into town, everything had loaded correctly and no issues happened. I continued to play around and have fun until about  a couple hours later, when it happened again. This time, my teleport button was on cooldown (what the heck!?) and I had to stop playing because I couldn't get out from under the house.

I was incredibly pissed and considering stopping for good, but this was proof that the game already had its claws on me. I was enjoying interacting with the towns-folk, all pretty stereotypical on the surface but with hidden depths which are revealed organically through talking to them and finishing missions. The many systems of the game are engrossing and interesting: fishing is not limited to pushing a button when the fish bites, cooking is not limited to adding the correct ingredients. The sense of progression feels very real, both by missions slowly unlocking one another and new systems and gadgets becoming available, and made me want to keep playing to see what unlocks next. I have a couple of minor gripes, but they're far, far outweighed by the amount of Good Brain Juice™ I get from playing.

The MMO aspect feels a bit undercooked, but it definitely fosters a friendly environment for interactions, and I think that's the most important part of it. 

Overall, I'll keep playing Palia as much as I can, until I inevitably fall through the ground into a limbo from which there's no escape.</p>

      <p>Palia is an exact copy of Disney Dreamlight Valley, but without Disney people.
S6 released this game about 7 months after Disney Dreamlight Valley was released. Pretty sure its a "Free" knockoff from that other game.
I'm never playing this or supporting the devs again because of how much BullS*** this game is.

Full of bugs, terrible netcode, over a hundred hours wasted on just trying to play the game normally via the Story (that I cant finish CAUSE of bugs.) that should have been fixed MONTHS AGO but still has a FEW fun elements.
Not only do they just release $50 skins and one (MAYBE two) bug fixes every few months, they rebranded their ENTIRE company to hide the past failure games they've made. MOBILE GAMES.

I personally Invested over $100 into this games cosmetics, and theres been no actual fixes to the game/netcode that actually matter. (THIS GAME IS VERY EASY TO EXPLOIT)

Their Social tab is a joke, it never saves parties (friend requests are always broken), chat is always down etc.
Their company seems to only put effort into their Assets, and NOT into the actual game servers. (which, has NO CLOUDFLARE protection btw, so their servers could be DDosed VERY easily.

I love the feel of the game regardless of the bugs, but since I learned about "Disney Dreamlight Valley" being released first, I wont be playing this anymore or supporting the devs.
They keep teasing a new area, but theres no leaks, or even teaser images. Once you complete the Story (in about a Week of playing in hours) and get the highest tools, there's NOTHING TO DO.

Give it a try, but good luck running it, it takes a NASA super computer to play it at an OK framerate with the version of Unreal 5 their running at MEDIUM or LOW settings!!!</p>

      <p>sort of if SIMS married minecraft but alot better. Fun cute and cozy I am having alot of fun playing it. It is calm and relaxing, low pressure, you basically start off with a housing plot and tent and go into house building from there. Unlike alot of games where getting a house in game is a massive grind, this is way better and you are  given a plot free straight out of the intro. I would watch a few tutorial type videos first to give you a head start, Letz Play K, and Sarah Sunstone are good ladies to introduce you to the intracacies of the world</p>

      <p>(Do not pay attention to the playtime, I played pretty much 99% of the content before it came to steam. So it's more like 40+ hours)

Palia is a nice, low stress, farm-ing type MMO-esque game. It's pretty alright.
But honestly, that's about the extent I can talk about this game.
Because outside of a few small niche things (Bug catching is like throwing Pokeballs) it really doesn't do much that you can't get from other farming village games. If Palia wasn't f2p, I'd probably not recommend it, but as it has no cost of entry, I'll just say: Try it for yourself.

If I had to give a reason for why I wouldn't recommend it, well, just that the game feels very shallow, and you're brick walled by so many timers, meaning you've basically got to wait a while before making very minor progressions. Means that your progression is stretched out over very little content, and when you try to engage with the content, you find out pretty quickly there's little to none of it.

I stopped playing for something like a year a while back, and came back recently to see what was new, and honestly? Almost nothing substantial, but the number of items in the store has increased by like 400%. 
The game honestly feels like it's a monetised time sink than a genuine experience, which is rather disappointing.
Plenty of potential, not so much of it realised.

Try it for yourself, but don't hold your breath.</p>

      <p>If Stardew Valley is to be considered as a cozy game, than Palia is... dreamy?

Despite playing SV for hunderds of hours with my wife, I would never play this kind of games on my own. Too peaceful. too quiet, too slow. Yet Palia somehow combined everything that I love almost on instinct level from other games and just smashed a "farm sim" sticker on it. 
- Platforming and adventure-ish gameplay approach like in Zelda? Check. 
- Smooth controls, interface and social aspect remotely reminding my beloved World of Warcraft? Check.
- Building system so perfect, that it looks like if Todd would give the dev team of Fallout 4 more than half-a-day to develop it? Check.
- Basically, everything you need from a canonical farming/life simulator aka Stardew Valley? CHECK.

This game certainly has some grinding implemented in it, yet considering how well the world, sound and the whole vibe of this game are designed, it doesn't matter at all. You can just go with the flow, carelessly run around and do random stuff while enjoying the calming music and peaceful views and in no time you, apparently, have collected half the stuff you needed for another bundle. 

Surely, a decent amount of work is seen in how light and welcoming the in-game world feels. The main storyline is finely implemented in this world, it develops in front of the player with good pace and it has some sort of a mystery in it, that makes me want to find out more. But the characters are not that interesting (except for a mere couple) and they seem more generic, than writers probably wanted them to be. 

Overall, I am very glad that I have stumbled upon this game so randomly, and it brings me nothing but relaxation and joy so far. Again, surprisingly, since even the established genre giant (SV) wasn't able to hold me for at least 30 minutes :)

8/10</p>

      <p>A little bit Stardew, a little bit Genshin, a little bit Breath of the Wild maybe, Palia has some good things going for it. It's an MMORPG with a cozy atmosphere to it. Emphasis on cozy.

PROS:

1) The art style is pretty. I see elements of Genshin Impact and Breath of the Wild here, but Singularity 6 makes their own artistic mark, too. It's really quite attractive. I like the little details, like that you can see the breeze blowing.
2) The characters are memorable individuals with their own personalities and stories. You can even romance some of them, like Tish, the carpenter cutie.
3) You can build your own homestead/dream house, and deck it out in decorations of all kinds. Want a farmhouse? A cottagecore cottage? A witchy abode? Something with fashionable chic? You can probably build it.
4) There's 8 different professions you learn along the way. While some may be familiar, such as mining, some also seem unique to this game (or at least unique to a small handful of games), such as bug catching and furniture making.
5) The world is interesting and beautiful. It's small, because they just released it into beta like a year ago, but it already has a thriving community. There's a bunch of how-tos on YouTube, 3 or 4 wikis, and some interactive maps online. There's currently only two adventuring zones, Kilima Valley and Bahari Bay, but Singularity 6 is working on their third: The Elderwood. Despite its small size, there's plenty to do. Decorating your homestead will keep you busy for a while just by itself.
6) At least for right now, while it's in beta, Palia is free to play. No subscriptions, no season or battle passes, none of that nonsense. Just download, make a character, and get lost in this world.
7) It's RELAXING. You can't die. There is no fall damage. You don't pass out like in Stardew. In fact, the late hours give you access to special materials, like magical flow wood. It's not violent, either. The hunting, for example, drops a loot bag. No skinning, or bones, or anything gross. I'm not sure if Sing-6 is going to change it (I hope not), but you can go anywhere without fear of aggroing a monster that lays you flat. It's truly relaxing.

CONS:

1) I'm having an issue with storage. You can get up to 5 bars in your backpack, but you run out of space quick. You start with 3, I believe, the 4th one is 5K gold, and the 5th is a whopping 25K gold (I'm having some trouble building up that amount. You know how you can make and utilize as many storage chests as you want in Minecraft? Not in Palia. You can only set down eight, and they fill up rapidly. Hoarding stuff for cooking or furniture making is difficult, because it all takes up precious space. I'm hoping they fix this soon. I'd like to build a storage warehouse on my land.
2) There's some place you can get stuck, which has happened to me a few times. They have a button on the main menu for a stuck character, so that's good. But, it's still annoying. I've also seen other players sink into the ground a little. Occasionally, an NPC appears to have a pathing problem, where their walking becomes stuttered or they scooch along the ground without moving. Again, beta.
3) They have a lot of interesting outfits and stuff in the game store. As far as I can tell, none of it is game-changing, so no pay-to-win. It's all just cosmetic. However, more than a few people have mentioned it being a little spendy, so you have to decide whether it's worth it if you're thinking of buying something. I think it's how they make their revenue, because the game is free to play right now. I'm not sure how else they make money.
4) The progression feels a little slow, but since the world is still small, the rate of progression might be a good thing right now. After profession level 5, hunting, fishing, foraging, mining, and bug-catching seem to slow down a lot. A little patience is necessary, but the pace isn't insurmountable. They may tweek it a bit when the world gets bigger, and they finish with beta testing.

All in all, I love this game. I've only been playing for maybe 3 weeks, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's cozy enough to be called a cozy game, but there are some challenging aspects to it. I look forward to what Sing-6 comes up with. They seem to care about their work and the players. Let's hope that attitude continues, and they don't someday succumb to Triple-A Mentality.

Give it a try! If you don't like it, if it's not for you, you haven't lost any money. But you might just gain a new favorite world to chill in.</p>

      <p>This game is absolutely adorable, I've thoroughly been enjoying it and I haven't even gotten finished finding everything! Even then, there's still plenty to do. The only thing you need to pay for is cosmetic items, which honestly is understandable since the game is free. The characters are enjoyable and have a lot of personality, and the game actually rewards you for playing with a group (though it's not required)!</p>

      <p>Palia is a very good game. It's kind of like Stardew Valley and Runescape. If you like either one, I suggest you give Palia a try. It's completely free, as well, except for cosmetics. Unfortunately, there are no cosmetics that aren't real money. The style is pretty and the characters are charming.</p>

      <p>Palia is a great game both at first glance and otherwise. Word of warning, if you like fast paced combat, non-stop action, and strategy this is not the game for you. If you however like peaceful venues, meditative music, great roleplay, and having fun with your friends this game has it all. You can build your own houses, you can have a bit of romance if you want, you can explore the entire map freely, and build all the furniture there is in the game and decorations. There are rewards for completing tasks and leveling sills, and trophies for hitting milestones. This is a lot of content considering that this game is still in beta. This game developer is clearly in it for the right reason, they clearly know what their audience wants, and they are promising more content to come... in fact their most recent patch added MORE furniture you can craft and collect. Despite not having any fast paced action I have already spent 172 hours in this game at the time of writing this review. This game makes it clear that you don't need fast paced action or strategy to enjoy a game, this is by now means a game like SWTOR, Skyrim, ESO, and The Fallout Series, and I am quite fine with that. Palia is not for fans of those franchises, and to be fair I have encountered very few bugs when compared to those games. The developers don't force you to spend money on unnecessary things to enjoy the great majority of the game, but they have this option. Most if not all of the things in this game can be crafted or bought with in game currency that you gain through in game means. WIll they at one point charge for this game? maybe but that day has not come. My belief is that they are doing fine at the moment with the players they have and with selling in game items and have no need for it at the moment. I do not foresee that this will change anytime soon but i would not mind it if it did change, because this game in every sense of the word is a paradise. It is calming and exciting, and makes me content. It is a game that is easy to play and because of it's nature there is no possibility of griefing like other games; this fosters a helpful and kind community. In conclusion is implore you, give this game a chance. You will not be sorry.</p>

      <p>I very quickly became obsessed with this game. First off, its free! Whats not to love about free? Secondly, there is so much fun stuff to do if you enjoy cozy games like stardew valley. It reminds me a bit of Grow:Song of the Evertree,  but if you could hunt. it has a similar vibe to that game imo. 

Every single person I've met on this game has been super kind and helpful. Its genuinely such a chill vibe. The downside for me is that it is a little bit glitchy at times, the party system only works half of the time, and i ruined a star quality dish because it froze the cooking animation ;-; (its hidden in my house now ^^)

Overall, solid 10/10 for me. Its so fun and chill. And again, its FREE! give it a try c:</p>

      <p>Don't get me wrong, this game has is problems.

There are still things that are a bit glichy, or don't work the way you'd think they should. For instance, climbing isn't perfect. Sometimes when you glide to a wall you grip it and then fall down it a little before you start climbing. I'm not hugely fond of the trade system in the game. I understand the reason they had it set up the way they do. They are trying to prevent people from getting things they haven't gotten themselves from other players. It just makes it a little frustrating when you spend a few hours trying to catch a fish and never see it, but your friend has one they don't need. 

That being said, this game has given me hours of fun fishing, mining, foraging, cooking, gardening, decorating, befriending the villagers, etc. There is so much to do, a bunch of little puzzles in the world, and over all the game play is fun. As a free to play game, I was willing to spend some money on cosmetics because I got enough enjoyment out of the game to spend it.

There is a lot to love here in a cozy game. The cooking is a lot of fun. You can cook with your friends, and each person who helped gets a stack for themselves. The fishing is relaxing, the mining/logging/foraging is straight forward and satisfying, the bug catching is fun and a nice edition to the game, and by far the best part of it all is meeting all of the villagers and building your relationship with the town. Finding out their likes and dislikes, and seeing their reaction when you gift them what they want for the week. 

I would say despite some of the little bugs here and there, the game itself is well worth playing.</p>

      <p>I absolutely love this game! Hands down one of the most enjoying survival/crafting build games I have ever played. No doubt in my mind I will spend so much time on this game. Beautiful graphic designs and game mechanics. Everything is so smooth and thought out. Great story line and side quests and hidden content to find and complete. I only have one true issue with this game and its that fact that there just is not enough storage space, like why cap us at 8 chests? Once you get far in the game you just can't do anything without deleting your resources to add what you need for something us. For such an amazing,peaceful and just fun adventure crafting game there just isn't enough storage space to store all of the things are hording crafting hearts desire. With that said I will absolute continue to play this game until completion and even after for it is one of the most enjoying games I have played in years! Keep up the great work you've made a wonderful game!</p>

Super easy, stress free, fun to play, engaging and easy on the eyes. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The characters are cute too, and I like that you can improve your relationships with the in-game characters, they aren't there just for quests. Would recommend!</p>

      <p>Pretty chill game. The housing customization has a good amount of freedom to it and the professions are both intertwined and can give you something to place in your house/s (for the most part, not sure if you can craft food that can be placed). The community also seems to be nice. I saw people calling for other players in chat when they see a rare resource so that others can go there and take it as well, which left an impression on me. And there\s a gifting system where you can request for an item and others can give it to you which also encourages cooperation.
Granted there are some mobile game-esque mechanics like waiting more than 10 minutes for a resource to be prepared, but you can't rush it with premium currency so I feel it's there mostly to put an emphasis on slow play, which is a good mentality to have with such games.
The game is free to play with the option to buy cosmetics so there's little reason to not try it out if one's interested.</p>

      <p>If you like games like animal crossing or stardew valley this game is for you! I'm not a fan of MMORPGs usually but in this game you don't have to interact with others if you don't want to. The game incourages partying with random players to make gathering ressources easier. 
Pros: plot building to your hearts content, music, characters
Cons: no easy fast travel (have to pay), Cannot move faster in the game (mounts), Hard to figure things out the first time (ex.where to find ressources)</p>

      <p>Although it has some bugs, this game is a great cozy coop. Started playing it with my husband and before I knew it, it had already been almost 7 hours. I will say that if they add the ability to trade with other players rather than fulfilling people's requests for items, it would be a lot better/more helpful than the current mechanic. Or at the very least allow for players to adjust the quantity and quality of items they request. 
Still highly recommend if you are looking for something chill and don't intend on going anywhere for a WHILE.</p>

      <p>An absolutely delightful game. It feels to me like somebody ran Oblivion through a Stardew Valley filter, and I love it. The NPCs are charming (many of them quite cheesy, in the absolute best way) and the design of both the village and the landscapes are as well, and the critters are varied enough to stay interesting as you explore. The quests are sometimes tricky to figure out what or where you're supposed to do and go, but the puzzles themselves are tricky enough to be pleasant without being frustrating in their difficulty or complexity. Everything seems well-paced, quests and skill-progression and character relationships. 

All in all it's a wonderful experience, and the fact that the predominant attitude of the other folks playing online seem so far to be amiable has been a refreshing relief, as is the fact that the world rarely seems so crowded with other players as to overwhelm any given area. I've only been playing for a week so far, but so far I absolutely love it, and have no intention of stopping.</p>

      <p>Has a decent gameplay loop of farming items and crafting, and the characters are very expressive. However, all of the outfits are paid items and the cheapest ones cost about $10 USD with the mid range being $20 - $30. Its much more enticing to get the shiny stuff through gameplay, even if there's a battle pass / seasons system. tldr I would love to spend time in this game but the rewards I want are all paid items that are too expensive.</p>

      <p>its fun, a bit grindy for certain items "uncommon" is actually Rare, Rare is Legendary, Legendary = Epic. I wish the Devs reworked their RNG a bit better. Thats my only gripe. People getting 5 copies of an item meanwhile you have the worst "luck" other than that, its a fantastic game. Cant wait to see what they come with next. Its a working process but its working well so far. (give me a freaking plush bro...plz.. its been Weeks)</p>

      <p>I love the game so much. It certainly feels like, and looks like, something that ought to cost at least $60. I don't have any complaints at all, but I do wish that they would add a system where you can earn, craft, or buy clothing/pets (with in game currency). It doesn't have to be as fancy as the premium items, just something fun or cute. I understand the developers need to make money somehow, but it's just kinda sad, y'know? Otherwise, the plushies and the pots are freakin adorable, the story is amazing, the quests are fun, the characters are unique, and the animals are sooo squishable. Also, the community is fantastic, so many nice people. <3</p>

      <p>This is an excellent game. It's rewarding, challenging, and definitely keeps my attention. It's the best of Stardew + Animal Crossing, except better. There's tons to do, the townspeople are useful and interesting. You can follow the quest lines or just farm + build. It's great. Fully recommend.

My only  complaint is how expensive the character cosmetics are. Boooo. But at least it doesn't impact game play.</p>

      <p>I really want to like this game and i can forgive some of its buginess because it's still pretty early on but the premium outfits are really starting to rub me the wrong way. I'd really like to spend money on them but they're vastly overpriced and can't be split into individual parts. I'd really like to not have to spend $20 on a hat I want and an outfit I don't when I could have split that. Or just spent that money on a game with far more polish to it! 
While I'll still keep playing for now, everything I've read has told me this game would have been far better off being a single player paid game instead of an mmo with wildly uneccessisary social features</p>

      <p>It's a vibe. I'm just grinding, chopping trees, gathering stuff, talking to cute villagers. There's so much to do & I've barely even done quests. It's a free game so if you don't like it there's no harm. The only thing I don't like is how expensive the outfits are. I know that's how they make their money and it's not anything you need but some of them are sooooo cute! I want to be supportive and buy stuff but it's like the cost of a game for a cute fit so I have to decide what I want.</p>

      <p>I like it, its like a Star Dew Valley MMO.  No combat, only crafting and farming but it runs well in beta and looks great.  Has a more social aspect to it.  Hoping they would add weather effects and night and day cycles at some point.  Seems to have a nice fan base.  Worth a try if you like life sim games.</p>

      <p>The cutest wee game, been very obsessed since I started. Feel a bit like Stardew Valley/ animal crossing but the graphics are super nice and it's got a nice fantasy story / background. The characters are also really nice and interesting. What's really fun is also that the game is really well done to play with others and make friends. It's still being developed so there is a lot of wee issues that can come up but the team is super good at fixing it and adding new content pretty much every month! Played more than a 100 hours so far and one of my favourite cosy games</p>

      <p>Really loving this game! Well designed and keeping me well intrigued. Reminds me of Sims, Animal Crossing, Runescape, other MMORPGs like FFXIV except it's more chill, relaxed, no stress, super friendly environment. So excited to see where things go as I'm still pretty new to it (20 hrs in). I see myself putting a ton more hours on this.</p>

      <p>Edit: I stopped playing this game because storage became a huge limited issue and upgrading it is ridiculously expensive. Kind of sad that storage is what kills a game. 

I don't normally go for these kinds of games. I've been going through a rough time and my brother recommended this game as a casual and laid back experience. There's no combat, rather there are 8 skills that you can level up by using those skills. There is an adventure aspect to it, even a few "dungeons" which are puzzle-based, like a lighter version of a Legend of Zelda puzzle. The game does get grindy, where you need to keep fishing or catching bugs over and over, and there are a few improvements that could be made, I.E. giving residents gifts from your storage would be nice, instead of having to run back to my home, check who wants what, and pull it all out of the chests. There is a crafting aspect to the game for tool upgrades, smelting and building a home, but even that gets difficult to keep up with as things become pretty expensive pretty quickly. Overall I think it's worth a try, it is free after all.</p>

      <p>⚠️Known issue with graphics card⚠️

If you have an external GPU such as NVIDIA or AMD, the game may not detect it! This has been a common issue often discussed in the community forum, but the developers are yet to recognize/ address it. According to Palia's website, a Factory reset of graphics card may help, but I never heard of a game requiring such steps before. I have a pc that runs most recent AAA and indie games in high to epic graphics. (intel I7-13/16GB RAM/ NVIDIA RTX 4070...) I tried disabling internal GPU and assigning NVIDIA to the game which was no use.
I understand this is a free game still in Beta, but the community posts didn't seem to do the job, so here I am. Please fix this issue and I will change my review.</p>

From things like its animation quality, the amazing level of detail in the game's story, to the interactions with in-game characters, and more; I have to say this game is a treasure.

      <p>Really fun and cozy game that helps encourages you to be a community within the players in the game! Been helped out several times by strangers and it was really fun!

Only critic(s) I have for this game is that they should make it an option to link an existing Palia account when you've downloaded it via Steam and accidentally skipped the process.... that and more face presets and more skins that can be  unlocked via grinding and not just in-game currency.

Other than that, it's a really fun  game to play, with or without friends!</p>

      <p>First off, the game has many bugs BUT theyre not game breaking in the slightest and are honestly really funny and are fixed with the smallest things on the user's end. Collect plushies, make money running a farm or mining, Help Hassian get rid of the invasive chappa population, find love and romance, help the black market dealer, glide around a breathtaking landscape, help your fellow townsfolk with their various tasks, learn about magic and design the house of your dreams. You must be asking, "Nev!? Is the game appropriate for my children?!" In my own opinion? Absolutely! But parents that is always up to you to decide, I personally know many parents who even play this game with their kids. All in all its an amazing game and I love it a lot. I mean I wouldn't have almost 200 hours and dropped $30 on cosmetics in the game if I didn't.</p>

      <p>This took a long time to download. It didn't like my graphics driver so i spent a half hour trying to update it. It didn't work for some reason but that's intel's fault not Palia's. I go to play the game anyway even without the best graphics and it gives me an error, I try 3 times. Looking up the error, I find that others who have tried to play Palia have been getting that error since this game was first launched with no fix or comment from the developers. Someone posted a supposed fix on reddit but it would involve changing the game start-up code and I wasn't comfortable with that. This game finished downloading at 7:30pm and i decided to just uninstall at 9:20pm. Never played. The 21 minutes was all figuring this out.</p>

      <p>In this current state of the game, it is not worth playing. Apprently the only way to switch accounts is to completely reset the character through customer support with no clear log out options on the main screen. This is not ideal, if you want your player base to grow it needs to be accessible. Not as cozy as it seems.</p>

Like in so many games, ALL keys can be bound to different actions.
Not the Camera - the camera is stuck at "K" which is for someone using UHJK as default movement keys troublesome.</p>

      <p>I know it's suppose to be free, but asking 16-30 dollars for basic cosmetics and having an "MMO" farm game where you can barely interact with other players is insane. There are better options for you out there.

Some of the character designs are cool though, the fishing robot is genuinely one of the most fun designs I've seen in a while. It's an ok game if you want a stardew like game for free, but if you're willing to spend even small amounts of money I promise you'll find better games for the price of ONE item in the store.</p>

      <p>I love the premise of this game and a lot of the ideas behind it. However, I positively despise most mechanics and other things about the game. I have played Palia on all available platforms during several different stages of its development. The developers of this game should be embarrassed at the lack of professionalism within it. The real money store is a predatory ploy for young players. The waiting periods for crafting are absurdly long and make the game feel like a mobile game. The additions to this game are extremely slow to arrive and often do not arrive on the expected date. There are frequent keybinding and clicking bugs that must be solved by players. The list goes on. I keep coming back to this game waiting for it to be something that it isn't; good. I'll probably still play as long as it's free to do so, but I do not recommend anyone getting into it at all.</p>

      <p>Palia isn’t full of brand-new game mechanics, but it combines ideas from other cozy and farming games really well. Together, they create a fun and unique experience.

I really like the game’s story and how magic fits into it. There are plenty of activities like bug catching, foraging, fishing, cooking, etc. While the grind can feel long, having lots of options makes it more enjoyable. If I get bored mining, I can just switch to cooking or fishing.

The developers are also doing a good job with updates, and it’s nice to see the game grow.

There are still some bugs, and a few of them are serious, but the developers are working to fix them regularly. My biggest issue is the lag, which I get both on PC and Switch. Also, using a gamepad feels awkward.

I’d love to see more locations added. Right now, we only have Kilima and Bahari Bay. Underwater areas or weather changes would be great. I also miss having seasons. During the 2023 Christmas event, the snow looked odd next to all the greenery and butterflies.</p>

      <p>Okay. I am writing this review with only about 4-5 days of me playing this game. You be the judge if I like this game or not.

For being a Beta game it surely has a lot and is fun. Already got me spending money to buy some clothes. But overall this game is very fun. Similar to Stardew Valley but it's coop and has of course it's own features to it. There's a learning curve to this game and it gives you a vague description or tutorial on how to do things, so I get why it's overwhelming to many. Google will be your best friend with this game. The community is VERY FRIENDLY. Everyone is so nice. There's some unspoken Palia Ethics already which I love. 

Overall, just needs some more tutorials for beginners and some items. I do hope they publish a "Trade with Other Player" feature and some Farm Animals and possibly a Mount you can ride, since it's a bit difficulty to get to one place to another.</p>

      <p>For a free game that's in beta still, you can see by the play hours of the positive reviews this game already offers a lot, and I had a really good time with it!

Here I'll go through what I was looking for before playing, the pros and cons and then offer some tips at the bottom. 

Basically:
+ lovely peaceful game
+ lots to do
+ not greedy devs, cosmetics only
- very buggy
- story and design still in beta

How free is it? 
It's just cosmetics; there's no way to pay to be better or faster. When you log in the first time, there's a message from Singularity 6 which basically says "if you like our game please tell people about it" which I thought was really nice, I never felt pressured to spend, I bought a couple of cosmetics to support them for giving me 100 hours of enjoyment.

What is the gameplay?

Very casual and easy-going, it's based around building your home and the core skills which you level up; bug catching, cooking, fishing, foraging, furniture crafting, gardening, hunting and mining. As you level up you unlock more things you can craft for each skill and these skills are how you interact with the story, complete objectives and challenges.

The villagers work the same way; you level up your relationship with them to unlock cool things and more quests, they also provide the structure; context to the quests and objectives you'll be completing. A small part of this is the main story line, which is pretty interesting so far, but I'd say like 10% complete at the moment. There are other stories of different villagers which are complete to varying degrees, since the game is in beta. I'll say the few cutscenes that are finished are really nice.

This happens across two maps Kilima (medium sized) and Bahari (large sized), and there's a lot of running around, but there's no fall damage and nothing can hurt you. There is fast travel, but the game does not point it out (I'll get to that). 

Everything important to the game tends to work well and is fun! It didn't lag at all or crash hardly at all. I was able to do most of everything required in the game without big issues.

Now, there are some negatives to consider; being a beta this game has many, many smaller bugs!

In my time almost everything you can think of had some sort of glitch (maps, menus, chat, gameplay, etc); there's a lot so here are some examples of the prominent common issues I had, as experienced played with a controller:

1. Menus can be jank, it gets stuck and you have to switch to the next tab and then back to fix it. Sometimes also you press a button to do one thing and it does something else which uses the same button. 

2. The map can be jank, you select one villager to track and it keeps selecting somebody else far away.

3. Also, from the map you can press a button to teleport home; this button is the same as the run button, but sometimes after closing the map menu, the game thinks it's open when it's not, so when you return to game and go to run you teleport home when you don't want to; since the areas are large and you have to wait before you can use the home teleport again, this bug was by far the most annoying!

4. You have a wheel to select the tool you want, sometimes it selects the same tool over and over again and you miss out on a rare insect or hunting opportunity because you can't put your fishing rod away in time.

5. Visually, EVERYBODY, every NPC and player, bug out; they're gliding across the floor, standing in the ground, floating above the ground, walking in place, walking through walls, appearing to fall, some players even get stuck under the inn. You can buy a cosmetic pet that runs around with you, but I couldn't use it because it was constantly bugging out and distracting me; dropping from the sky in front of me or flipping out, and other player's physics items are always stretching and glitching out. Mostly this happens when you first get there and from a distance, but not always. It did not affect the gameplay but it's absolutely something you'll notice, even if you do get used to it quickly.

6. A few NPC positions can make it hard to interact with them or around them, like Hassian stands on the same exact spot as his dog Tau, and Shiffa blocks access to her own anvil, so you have to jump around to find the specific spot needed.

7. I had a constant bug where my character would keep turning 180 degrees when still to face the camera; I HATE this bug, especially when you're around other players, lol.

There are design issues too: 

1. Lack of tutorials for important or basic things, or tutorials appearing far after you need them when you're first starting. I had to look up basic things on my phone because simple, obvious things like dragging and dropping would not work.

2. You can't sell furniture you make, even for the price of the materials or for 1 gold just to get rid of them; you have to store or destroy furniture.

3. NPCs sometimes ask for outrageously rare items for little to no reason.

4. If you don't enjoy one of the skills it can take a long time to reach the level up needed (like I don't enjoy cooking). A few quests require items only obtainable by progressing far in one of these skills, but there should always be another way to get these items, even if it's tricky, otherwise you're forcing players to grind something they don't enjoy. This was rare but still an issue.

5. Lastly, I'd say some of the quests require a lot of work and have a little or no pay off (Jina's picnic, Tish's dance) I again assume due to being beta. Some quests are very anticlimactic and end with no real consequence.

Overall:

Even despite all of that jank I had a great time with this game. This main gameplay of using your skills to help NPCs and unlock things as you play was peaceful and mostly fun and rewarding, you can decorate your property quite impressively, and throughout the game it's fun discovering what you can unlock you had no idea about. 

There's a review saying this game is not for introverts but I really have to disagree, I think there's one quest that might need interaction (fulfil a player request). If you do want to talk the game is basically full of people who just want to chill and build a cool little house, so I found people really chill and helpful anyway. Totally recommend!

Tips!

1. Know what you have! 

There's a lot of rare and epic items in the game, some which can take days to find if you're looking for them, which you might find by chance, so if you're just starting and you get an epic bug or fish that you don't know what to do with, keep it! (as you might want it later for something to do with a door and night sky temple) and if you see a weird bug try and get it!

2. I would NOT gift any NPC a rare or epic item unless it's for a quest objective, it's not worth it! Also one specific bug, Duskwing Butterflies, are listed as "uncommon" but they're technically like epics in rarity.

3. Cooking uses items from your inventory first, then from your storage, so make sure you have enough stuff to protect the things you want to keep! You can buy a locked chest from Tish's shop to keep things safe.

4. For fishing, if you're trying to catch a certain fish (especially rare or epic fish), it will show you the fish before you reel it in to see if you need it or not so if you don't want it, don't reel it in! 
Once the fish has gone back down, then reel in, as this will reset the fish and you'll keep the bait; really important for glow worms which are hard to get, but keep an eye on the condition of the rod!

5. The Palia wiki is really useful for finding things.

6. You'll eventually get to glowy (flow) trees, people meet up to chop these at the same time. If you hit each glowing tree once with your axe you get the same loot as everyone else who hits it, even if you don't chop it down! It's kind to let people know the location (you'll see this in chat a lot).

7. You can date all the villagers with no consequence, they don't care, lol.

Have fun!</p>

      <p>I'm really having a lot of fun playing Palia. it's just such a cosy game. i  love the art style and the NCP characters are so easy to fall in love with - you really can feel so much personality from each one. the game can feel a little slow in terms of level up your gear and there's definately a lot of grinding that has to be done here and there. but i feel like the fun interactive quests given to you by NCP's makes up for this.</p>

      <p>This has been an excellent game to play. So many elements come together to just really...make the perfect game. 

I find this game just so relaxing, with the right amount of story and motivation to keep farming for resources.
I have put in over 200 hours now, and I still love it.

I can't wait to see what they continue to do with the game, and the content they decide to bring!</p>

      <p>I've been playing since the closed bèta. Stopped playing for a bit, but now I'm back into the grind. Amazing game, good quests, the grind is not too hard. Some bugs, but the S6 team handles them. The game is online so you can play with friends or random people. Everyone so far has been very friendly.

Highly recommend!</p>

      <p>Never thought I'd see the day where I wouldn't recommend something you get for free. 

The game will not recognize a dedicated GPU, and it's a well known problem. Even though it's in early access, that's something they need to have fixed before sending it out. 

I may check back once that is fixed, but for now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</p>

      <p>I really struggle to find games I like that aren't to hard to progress with and don't require money to win. I finally found one! This game is stunning and runs so well. Apart from being a bit glitchy at times this game is *chefs kiss* perfect! Also as a person of colour, I would like to say a massive thank you to the devs for the black hair textures and religious headdress that are included with the character creation! I feel seen! currently have braided space buns :D.  I've only been playing for about 6 hours so I cant wait to see what else the game holds when I get further into it. I Cannot recommend this enough. If you like relaxed games with casual quests, this one is for you!</p>

      <p>Not for me - probably just not the target audience.

The initial setup seems okay at first, but after I realized that crafting is limited to simply making simplistic furniture/benches/tools for advancing friendship/romance quests, then it seemed a bit pointless.  Toss in a premium store for real money, and I'd much rather pay for an actual game with a bit more depth to it.

Perhaps down the line they'll add more complexity, but considering that this is an online co-op game, I doubt it.

Your mileage with it may vary if you like online co-op or have younger kids.  However, I'll note that I noticed several inconsistencies with the UI not showing me the location of certain quest givers or other objectives.  I'm an old school gamer, so this didn't bother me much, but younger players may find it frustrating.

To summarize - for me this is a pass, but it is free, so give it a try.</p>

      <p>disregard my playtime, i played a lot before it was added to steam. played since the last closed beta. i really enjoyed it for the first week or so i played, but it's become clear that the devs dont care about making an actual good game. the devs are more focused on adding expensive cosmetics to the cash shop than adding content, bug fixes, and QOL. 
they nerf every single money-making method whenever a new one pops up, so it's a total grindfest.
was marketed as an MMO but there are not MMO functions- you see other players every now and then, but there's no meaningful social activities. would be better as a single player game- theres just no reason for it to be multi-player. 
speaking of multipklayer- the community reeks of toxic positivity and has for months, while ironically being very elitist and rude to anyone who criticizes the game. if you dare not call out the palium ore and magic trees when you gather it, you'll be ridiculed. jfc.
house decorating is fun though.</p>

      <p>I'm somewhat picky about what games I play, but holy cow Palia did not disappoint. It instantly sucked me in. It's like if an MMO didn't infuriate you and it was just the good stuff. There's no combat so no worrying about dying to something that will just tick you off. I'll go into more specifics below.

CHARACTERS/NPCs:
The characters in the village all have their own unique personalities that are easy to remember and you'll definitely come to have your own favorites and...less favorites. You can also initiate a romance with certain characters, something that's really cool and that I wish was incorporated into more games. The dialogue is really well-written and can change based on different factors of your character, something that really adds to the experience. You get different unique quests from the characters when you reach certain friendship goals with them, something that keeps you engaged and constantly keeps you busy with quests.

QUESTS/RIDDLES:
Normally, riddles infuriate me in games since I am not particularly puzzle inclined. Luckily, most of the riddles in Palia are super easy to solve. I don't have to look things up very often, which is a complaint I have a lot about other games that I've played. There are also a lot of quests which keep you quite busy so that you always have something to do, but not in an overwhelming way.

SKILLS:
Your character has multiple different skills (Gardening, Farming, Mining, etc.) that you can level up and get a reward when you reach the lv. 10 milestone of a particular skill. It can be a bit of a grind. It's not frustrating, but it can be time-consuming so it just depends on your preference for grinding skills to raise them.

SHOP/MICROTRANSACTIONS:
Since Palia is free to play, it makes sense to include some content that is paid for with real currency. As of right now, it's only cosmetic aspects (fancy clothes, tool skins, pets, gliders, etc.) that cost money. It doesn't impact that game at all, entirely the player's own preference and even if you don't want to pay for the cooler looking clothes, there are different free options for your character's outfit.</p>

I do think it would be cool to have some outfits people could buy with palia coins as well.
I also wish that some palium would appear in kilma like flow trees do but maybe that's just me lolz
Its a lovely world to get lost in with people from all over the world and with options to keep you safe you can even play with your friends or completely solo but it is a game about pals so working together always gives more rewards. Its cute cosy and the decorating side of it is next level epic! 
Its a game for all guys gals adults kids and all in between which is hard to find in games. Even if your new u will always find someone who can help you and maybe make a new pal too :)
The npcs are adorable and so fun to talk too plus theres something for everyone!! 
Cooking fishing hunting mining gardening furniture crafting and catching cute bugs so fun hehe.
If you play comment for ign and maybe we can be pals too :)</p>

- There's so much content
- It runs REALLY well like I did not have a single bug or crash so far
- It looks cute
- Main quest and side quests are good and NPCs are adorable 
- Customisation is crazy, like you have A LOT of space and A LOT of items to discover, build and place on your estate

I highly recommend to anyone who likes games like The Sims, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and so on...</p>

      <p>Beautiful Game, Good mechanics have a lot to cover and grow i like that it gives a private space to craft and build your own things. One thing i would say to add more names around the map and add some more areas.</p>

      <p>Honestly, yes. I was hyped about this game when it first came out, and I may of been expecting a little too much for a game that just had entered closed beta. Then when open beta came, I found myself distracted by a thousand other titles instead.

HOWEVER. This game has drawn me back to it a few times for my curiosity of it's charm. It has quest lines, crafting of many sorts, farming/grinding material, gold farming, and 8 skills to level; Including cooking, logging, gardening (farming), furniture making (building/decor), mining, bug catching, hunting, and of course everyone's favorite in a game, fishing. Plus, there's building up your own plot with intricate decorating and a lovely building system for it, itches that "Sims" game feel. The game also now has a cute minigame called hotpot that everyone wins at technically and can get you prizes, as well as parkour course. My point being, the devs ARE adding things since I first played, and that's what keeps me coming back.

My only gripe with the game, and it may be yours too, is that the map is lacking in expansion a bit. If you're someone who loves exploration, you'll enjoy the map for the first 10 hours, but after that, you kinda know where everything is easily enough. I suggest doing the quests to do more exploring and navigational puzzles.

Overall, a solid 7/10 experience for the average cozy gamer who likes a healthy community and grinding game w/ somewhat MMO experience to it.</p>

      <p>Great game no loosing stuff no player killing you, you play at your pace lots of stuff to do and collect.
 Build you own house and I mean big house with all the goodies inside is nice, cooking and farming is very nice pass time.
 Hope the new map come soon and hope they make even bigger.

      <p>This is a good chill game if you are looking for something relaxing to pass the time. There is Fishing, Hunting, and Farming but you don't have to worry about things trying to kill you. Game mechanics are smooth, nice visuals and there are also cosmetic upgrades you can purchase. Not bad for a free game.</p>

      <p>This could be a great game, but it's an absolute bugfest. Should be fine solo, but co-op gets ruined by so many related bugs.

- Party members load invisible quite a lot so all you see is a floating name. This lasts until the next loading screen, so you can't see what they do, struggle finding them and can't coordinate properly.
- Party sometimes breaks in a sense that one person sees the party, but the other doesn't (no party member UI, no compass visibility, friend list says you can invite people that are actually in your party, the button does nothing). This requires a restart.
- Party member names are sometimes green, sometimes white. Sometimes you see them on the compass, other times you don't.
- Quests sometimes only show for 1 person on the compass, but if you are next to the NPC, you will see it on top of their head.
- Quests sometimes only genuinely appear for 1 person in the party, even though you've done everything together from the start. This causes a desync in progression.
- Party members often show half in the floor (NPCs too), or way underground. I've even seen them run around in the basement of a building when they never even entered it.
- Fishing rods of other players sometimes appear invisible.
- Hunting deer is a challenge when the deer spaz and teleport around.
- Tutorial popups are bugged in an annoying way. I keep seeing the same ones I've seen before reappearing, even had it happen twice 5 seconds apart. There is an option to disable tutorials, but that way you also won't learn anything new you haven't seen before, so it's either getting spammed by useless popups or never learning what you should. Also had a tutorial overal a developer note, which froze all my controls as I couldn't click the button behind the tutorial popup and had to restart.

These are not hardware/network issues. These are game issues. I am enjoying the gameplay as such, but these issues are frustrating.</p>

      <p>[h1] I was really surprised with Palia [/h1]

I remember seeing the trailer debut at a Nintendo Direct and saw it was going to be a Free To Play Farming Game. When I heard this, I was intrigued but for some reason never gave it a shot. I always just assumed it had some really poor Pay to Win features that I didn't want to find out about but boy was I wrong.

If you love Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing and really any sort of Farming Life Game, then by all means give Palia a shot. You have a lot of things to do. You can Farm Crops, Cook Foods, Smelt down Ores, Craft Furniture, Become friends with people which leads to romancing them. There are a bunch of quests you can do for rewards. You gain a lot of tools early on which allow you to Chop, Mine, Fish, Catch Bugs, Farm and so much more. You get your own Plot of land where you can build a house and really just customise your own home however you want.

Just a very fun pass the time sort of game. Really enjoyed the time I've spent on this game and I'm excited to see what else I can discover!</p>

I thought It would be vile waiting for things to build! I hate those free to play games that charge to speed things up.

I have never been so wrong about a video game, this game is perfect for people of all skill levels with the options to be extremely creative in house building I have even seen everything from pixel art Pokemon, stone towers and stunning forests.

The game somehow feels super refreshing and I sit down to play for a hour and the days flown by me.

<B>Do not miss out on this game</B> like I would have done if not for a recommendation of a friend.

Every action feels valuable and the economy is perfect with the balance between rewarding and time consuming creating this masterpiece of a game.</p>

      <p>I love a crafting game, i usually enjoy the likes of stardew valley, harvestmoon, etc. 
I came across Palia, I've recently started playing, and so far I absolutely love it. 
I understand it's got some kinks to be worked out, I was kicked last night, I've had my name stuck, can't place things sometimes, the bugs don't all place, but I'm sure those are all things that will be worked out. 
My only issue, is the boxes, I'm very much used to being able to have more boxes for storage,  but in this case the storage only goes to 1000 and something, and that's it and with bugs and fish not being able to be placed at the moment it's taking up my storage. 
I'd love if the game allowed you to have more boxes or even like the backpack, where you can unlock multiple sections withing for more space, diablo has that, one chest and you can get multiple sections to have more room for stuff and you can organise things into different sections to be more organised.

I love the idea of being able to decorate the house and put things on shelves, I also live the idea of being able to use the pantry once that's up and running, that too will help with storage.

So far I think it's a fantastic little game, being able to make and play with friends, sharing the look, interacting with others, the quests and lovely as are the NPCs. 

If this is what the game is now, I can't wait to see it when it's all complete. ❤️</p>

      <p>If Stardew Valley and Dreamlight Valley had a spicy love affair, you get Palia. For a free game, you get more than what you pay for. The overall wholesomeness of the game makes it easy to get into. The community is extremely helpful and friends can be made all over. 

Much like the polyamorous relationships with the pretty purple elves; the game actively encourages teamwork and bringing friends along on your errands. There are benefits to working with others and you are able to choose your own pace for the game. 

The game uses real time for progression. Farming and refining materials are done over time. This makes it easy to play casually. Crafting and decorating are straightforward, but cooking has the most interesting mechanics. Preparing meals and putting them together brings an odd sense of satisfaction to my brain.

There's no combat other than hunting passive creatures, but I suspect something more substantial will be introduced beyond beta.

Why is it free? Cosmetics. That's all. Supporting the devs is a small price to pay for looking pretty and you're given a large variety of wardrobe items to work with for free anyway and you can change your appearance quite often for no fees. I pray this does not age like milk.

The greatest feature Palia has to offer is Hotpot. A deceptively addictive card game that's easy to play and easy to love. Even if you don't win a full deck, you still earn rewards. The Tower is also a fun jumping puzzle game if that's up your alley to pass the time.

Palia is a great game to invest in if you're looking for a good time sink.

Also the Bluebristle Muujin can go to hell.</p>

      <p>An accessible and relaxing game. Even more fun and addictive with your gf/bf, friends or really, just people around are generally really kind. It's a blast to for example go mining alone, encounter a random player who's hunting and join them on the fly. There's a lot of emphasis on freedom and grouping up with other people, while still being fun playing alone.

I know it's a free game, but I'd love to see *some* options to get a premium currency slowly. The customization is there, but compared to the rest of the content it's severely lacking unless you pay real life cash.

It's everything buy pay to win, though. No P2W, no timewalls, no ads, just a solid game to play for hours on end without any pressure.
It's great to have a movie/audiobook while having Palia on the side as well</p>

      <p>I have a hard time sticking with games like this but this has got me hooked. I love the community and I love the  mechanics of the game. The game is new so sometimes it does crash but it's only happened to me once so far. You can progress without spending real currency. The only paid items are clothing tool skins and pets. All purely cosmetic. The story line is fun and there is so much to do. The characters have amazing personality and the quests are never ending. If you want a game like Stardew or Harvest moon without all the stress this game is for you.</p>

      <p>I have this game on my switch and steam, and must admit I've played mainly on the switch because it's easier for me at the moment, but I highly recommend this game.

I downloaded it 5 months ago when I was after a cheap new game, something to kill the time while my newborn was sleeping.

The first few days of playing I won't lie I was bored senseless, and was ready to give up, but I decided to give it another go and I'm so glad I did. I won't lie, I'm slightly addicted to it now.

This game is in beta and already has so much content. The game is jittery, and could do with tweaking a bit in some places, but the developers have done an amazing job already.
The game has fishing, farming, foraging, mining, furniture making and cooking. It has friendships and relationships, and numerous quests.
I personally think more NPCs would be a great addition. Also more farming plots and things to grow. Also more things to hunt. But again this is still a beta game. I have clocked up over 300 hours. They have regular updates, they don't always fix the stuff that needs it, but they always add stuff. Plushies are a major hype in this game. You will find out when you download it.
If you're looking for a nice chilled game, then definitely download it, you have nothing to lose while it's free.</p>

      <p>Very fun stardew like game! I havent really felt anything is too repetive or anything so far and the public chat / community seems very nice! I think the size of the map is really cool and makes the idea of exploring seem fruitful with the variety of forage types. Also the fact that some villagers live in different sections of the 2 maps makes you have a reason to go between. I'm definitely going to recommend this game to my friends with the preference of having the graphics low if you dont have that great of a pc.</p>

      <p>Palia is a very fun cozy game,  it is both relaxing and entertaining. Worth the download, doesn't feel like a "free" MMO game. It is a good quality game with seemingly lots to do without being too repetitive or overwhelming. I like the music and the atmosphere and the visuals of the game. The decorating aspect of the game is phenomenal, there are so much customization options and super cute pieces to work with. 
Some thing I'm hoping to see in the future would be the ability to have a horse or some kind of means of transport other than running, gliding, or the fast travel option. 
I also wish there was a bit more direction with some of the bigger story-line quests but this isn't a deal breaker issue.</p>

      <p>I think Palia is great- very engaging and fun. Cute characters with little personalities. Its a cozy feelgood game, where you mine, fish, hunt and gather materials to make more materials to make more materials to make decorations and money. Its fun!</p>

      <p>I mainly play on the switch just because I prefer portable games. But this game works and runs much more seamlessly on PC. The graphics are of course better as well. In general this game is a really fun cozy game and grinding for materials doesn't feel too annoying. I like how it seems to take inspiration from fun activities among a whole bunch of different games in this genre. Only ran into a couple of small bugs that got fixed very quick and never made the game unplayable. I do also like that it's not "pay to win" and as far as purchasing things goes it's purely cosmetic things. I thoroughly enjoy the story and game concept and it's very rewarding to play with friends with all the extra perks of teamwork. Very clean game design and the sound effects and voice lines are wonderful and very relaxing. <3 I'd say it's a solid 9.5/10 I love this game and cannot wait for the full release. :3 Would also love more animal/creature themed outfits!</p>

      <p>The story is interesting and fun to explore along with the characters that guide you and direct you to the next point. If that isn't what gets you going, there is also home decor, farming, and so many other things to do. I'm not really in it for the social aspects, but its full of a nice and welcoming community that is willing to help. I'm excited to learn more about the world and play my way.</p>

      <p>A relaxing game that you easily lose track of time and will spend hours in because there is so much to do.  I make a plan to do something but get side tracked or distracted while doing whatever it was.  That's not always a bad thing, since whatever waylaid you, you needed anyways or was better than what you were first doing.  This game isn't for people wanting fast paced excitement (except cooking, still figuring that timed mini game out).  This game is perfect for all those people that play online games, but are more into the crafting or gathering part.</p>

      <p>Cool relaxing gameplay although sometimes I just feel like doing some Monster Hunting the game itself is unique there is lots to do for a game that has no kind of pvp intention or pve its more of a craft and farm play style its worth playing if you just want to relax but if you are some one that hates the Idea of farming for mats not really going to hit your craving especially if you are looking for Blood (pvp) or even monster battling.</p>

      <p>Unlike most other mmo's, this is relaxing and takes its sweet time. Sure, sometimes you can be overwhelmed with everything that you can farm and do, but overall, this feels more relaxing than any other mmo out there. There is no gearfarming, there is no raider.io ruining your chances of getting in a group, there are no toxic players (might be but I haven't seen one yet) and you are rewarded for being nice. WoW and more mmorpgs like that have been a toxic ground of competetiveness and here, sure you want to brag about your building but it feels more wholesome...

I'm sure some asshole is going to try and make it into a competetive speedrun hellhole... Let's hope not though...</p>

There is just so much to do and so much fun to be had, it's hard to get off most days! You can play alone or with friends, you can build a house and decorate it, you can go hunting, bug catching, fishing, cooking, mining, and so much more! If you haven't tried it, you really need to! Awesome game! I hope the quests never end so I can play forever! :)</p>

      <p>So far, it is everythiiing Ihave been looking for in a fantasy RPG. you can explore LARGE maps freely, and have multiple skills/hobbies to choose from, create your own cozy home, cuztomize your character freely, AND the quests have no time constraint! which I greatly appreciate because absolutely no pressure. I can go my own pace doing what I like to do, etc. The world-building is absolutely breathtaking! I do wish the developers could a horse or some sort of vehicle to travel across the VAST maps faster instead of having to run/sprint <3</p>

      <p>Very chill and addicting. You are confined to a fairly small world so you get to know the area quickly. It's kinda got this Disney Dreamlight Valley/Stardew thing going on so you go into town a lot getting to know the same cast of characters developing your relationship tier with them, getting rewards from them etc. 

The home and garden area is a big part of this game as you can visit peoples homes if they are set to public. You expand your land, unlock tons of stuff, craft, decorate. You can even put down the gold tier fish you catch as fish tanks to show off what you've caught. Pretty neat.

Like a lot of survival/gathering you need the nice pick for the big rocks, the nice axe for the big trees etc etc so there is some grind but it's all very casual.

Each in game night starting 6pm until morning, players gather at this casino type area underneath the general goods store and play cards. A foodie go fish style game that rewards you with coins to spin at a wheel of fortune. The tables fill up fast which makes it pretty exciting to get a spot and have fun with the community.

Another neat community feature is the item request system. You can request a limited number of just about any items. You can help other people get items they need or request something you might need in a pinch.

I had a few bugs mainly dialogue/menu related where I had to restart the game, but the stakes are so low in this game a restart is no biggie and nothing was perma bugged.

Overall hard recommend. For a free game it's worth it.</p>

I just wish it wouldn't happen so often, I'll be playing for a bit and then crash, the next time it crashes it usually happens fairly quickly after the first crash and makes me give up playing when it happens too often.

      <p>It's a fun game. There are some bugs, but nothing major (example: sometimes there is a specific spot you have to stand to open a door or gather a material). It does require some interaction via chat and there are some materials you cannot gather without help from other players (materials that are required for advancement), so just be aware of that. I was considering letting my daughter play till I learned that, so we will be waiting until she's a bit older.</p>

      <p>I'd say its a mix of Animal Crossing (for Home building/decorating, Home tours) Stardew (Crops, Fishing and Relationship building) and Zelda: BoTW (The over world resource gathering, Exploration with Wall Climbing stamina, Hang Glider and Hunting) all combined into an "MMO" package filled with friendly players to interact and gather materials with.  While I do wish there was more in the way of combat (Maybe like a Stardew mine system where you can go down levels with friends and fight monsters using swords or some other tool, something simple they can implement and not interfere with the design philosophy) The game overall is very fun and well worth your time. 

No P2W or anything inside their premium shop, just cosmetic items (Clothes, Home Environment, Pets that can follow you around only, etc) Hoping they keep expanding on the game and it keeps growing because there is a lot of promise here!</p>

      <p>After playing this game for roughly 110 hours, I can safely say it's worth the time. I spent about 80 of said hours completing the main story line, but I imagine people who did not venture into the sidequests, relationship and friendship quests could complete the main story line (which finished for me when I completed "Find your Shepp," as it was the last thing I did in the main quest line) in a shorter time period. I am still not finished at 110 hours with friendship quests (have not maxed out any friendships yet) or relationship quests (have only completed 1 at this time). I have only just now reached Level 10 of two of the eight core skills you're expected to develop, and this is considered a Bronze Level while Level 50 of the skill is considered a Gold Level. I have not yet collected all bugs, or fish of Palia. I have not yet built all variations/collections of furniture. I clearly still have many, many hours of game-play left of Palia to complete. You do not need to spend "real money" in order to enjoy this game, this game completely functions without the premium cosmetics. But if you're like me, and you have such an enjoyable and incredible experience playing, buying some "Palia coins" to spend on cosmetics seems fitting to show your support for the game. My in-game experience with other players has been overall positive. People are helpful, informative, and generally kind. There are one-off experiences where people have strange behavior, but it's the internet. I caught on to in-game lingo quickly, scoured Internet resources and tools to learn a few quirky things about the game; but overall, I have been able to figure out how to play the game on my own or with the in-game guides/tutorials. There's been very little I've had to research on how to do because there wasn't enough instruction, really just driven by my own impatience and desire to complete collections. There's a lot about this game I still don't know about, even 110 hours into it. The seasoned players I read online and especially coming into this game during a new feature called "Home Tours," WOW -- I had no idea how serious some Palia players have been the last 11 months of this game. You will see some people complaining about how there isn't enough to do or how there aren't enough updates or how the developers aren't pushing out enough content; but truthfully, a game that takes 80 hours to complete for a normal person is pretty impressive content. A game that allows you to sink an additional 50+ hours into for just fun and skill building and side-quest completion is even more impressive. People who are criticizing a lack of "stuff to do" have just been over-saturating themselves with it and playing too long. Trust me..... there's so much to do..... so many bugs to catch, so many things to build, so many crops to grow, so many jams to make, so many fish to lure... so many, so many, so many things to do.</p>

      <p>Palia is a very calm and adventurous game. I feel like you could never get bored while playing this game; there are always quests to do, people to meet/see, and a bunch of activities to level up on!</p>

      <p>The game is so cozy and fun -- a tad frustrating at times, but they do tend to fix some of the quests that are too hard/require too much grinding. (If you love fishing, this is the game for you!) I do like having other folks in the world with me to help out/hang out with while playing. The NPC characters are great too :D</p>

      <p>First time experiencing a cozy game and making a review considering how many games played.  I am very pleased! The quality of the game is amazing since it is free to play and in Beta. This game ticks many boxes, crafting, housing/decoration, questing, engaging characters, exploration, fun mechanics, lovely community, and visual appeal all with no pressure. I have seen comments about the cash shop items cost and yes they are little steep but they have to make money to keep evolving. It appears the Devs are dedicated in the future of the game. I hope this game continues forward as I so enjoy playing.</p>

      <p>I just recently transferred my account to steam, but have been playing since closed beta. Palia is such a wonderful game if you like cozy type games. Highly recommend for players just wanting to build, farm, gather, hunt, fish, and interact with npcs.</p>

      <p>I will change my review when this game becomes a REAL MMO and I can play it with my friends!
right now you can only gather the materials with your friends and your farms are separate , and you can't progress together which is a bummer.
Besides what I mentioned ,the game is in perfect condition for solo players.
I'm sure the devs would do the right thing about the co-op thing but until then I'm going to pass :(</p>

      <p>horrible game. dont weaste your time. unplayable. not even the mouse pointer works. its somewhere else but not where it should be. this game interferes with other windows and screen resolution, it's not even easy to move if across screens. 

it also continues to play it's music even when the game is closed. so annoying.

extremely poor.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy playing this Game. 
What i don't like are the prices for the clothes. They look so nice, but you can only pay them with real money and i don't want to spent 40 euro for nice clothes.. so it would be better if you could pay with the in game currency..</p>

      <p>Poor excuse for a Zelda rip-off. I quit after the horrendous, un-skippable tutorial. 

Also game continually froze while it sold me the "Premium Content". Good luck ensnaring children and gullible adults you predators.</p>

A cutesy, vibrant, fantasy MMORPG that I can play with friends and just have a chill time on.</p>

      <p>I love this game very much. I know that you are taking our suggestions/recommendations considerably.

I don't have too much I like to see get done .

1. We should be ablet o get mounts to have us travel faster, as the gane is growing. 

2. I know you get this a lot, and know this game is peaceful which is great, however some sort of combat should be an option for those who like a little fight here and there in a game 

3. Furniture should be able to be used. Like may laying in the bed, sitting on a chair , toy know what I mean.

  You devs are so nice and I love your responses to out ideas. Keep up the good work, this game is headed in the right direction. 😁</p>

      <p>Didn't like it. You might, I just don't.

I had a lot of trouble getting the game to work. I had to go into my steam audio settings and ensure everything was set specifically to my headphones and mic(which most games just do on their own) or else the game would not load at all... then I had issues where my escape button stopped working and I had to force exit. After that, the game worked, but there's tons of audio stuttering... but, to be fair- my computer is an older one. However, I run Genshin at 60fps most of the time with no audio issues at all.

I find the character designs to be a mixed bag. The player characters are serviceable- I was able to make one of my favorite OCs, but the hairstyle selection was still somewhat limited in terms of longer hair.

The NPCs are... very jarring? They're very cringe and cutesy, a bit, which... can be fine but they force you through tutorial after tutorial and it gets old really fast... there's lots of tutorial menus appearing on other tutorial menus and it just... does not stop for the first 30 to 40 minutes.

I don't care for the character designs of the NPCs overall. They are just purple people with pointy ears, nothing else to them. That CAN work, but in this case it just feels random and strange... I don't feel immersed at all. There are lots of ways purple or blue elves could work; make their character designs super interesting, but they are all just random human-like people.

Then there's the gameplay. Hunting and fishing are alright. Anything else... zzzzzzzzz. Very boring. The UI feels very unfinished, which for a game that's been out for a year... that's unacceptable.

Climbing is buggy and messy. You'll often clip into things. There's not a lot of people, those that are there don't really talk much. Except the NPCs. They don't shut up :)</p>

I installed this game this morning I purchased it back in mid July so I am unable to get a refund.

I got into the game after making a character, I got up to the first point where you get a pick axe and have to clear debris, the game was bugged to where I could not select the pick axe and was unable to go forward, I had to force close the game to exit the game because I a lot of the menus was non functional. Upon reloading the game, it had my saved character, granted the buttons to do anything to select that character and enter into the gameplay world was non functional, if I was able to get a refund I would, this is fucking embarrassing, the game simply does not work, I really need to stop playing pre release games.</p>

      <p>I honestly don't think I've ever picked up a free to play game that has gripped me this hard since I was playing Runescape as a kid in like 2005. I've had the game for 3 calendar days and have put 30 hours into it.

It's everything you love about Stardew Valley, Dreamlight Valley, and Animal Crossing but in the style of an MMO. There are Real Money Purchases but only for cosmetics.

Make friends with a robot, pet a dog, hunt some deer. There's plenty to do and friends to be made - you lose nothing picking up this incredible F2P game.</p>

      <p>- Poorly Optimized
- Bad Controls
- Crashed my overpowered computer the 1st time I tried to run the game, because it glitched and could not recognize my RTX 3050 GPU as valid.  

Tried to contact to support about a few issues I have found in just 2.4 Hours. I get kicked out of support when i go to submit my ticket, instead of allowing me to submit a ticket. This company is worse than almost any I have seen

Edit 9/27/2024: Bugs are getting worse with every update.  Game crashed 3 times today, only 1 generated a crash report.  Never having been able to submit a support ticket, I found out I was already banned from their support the moment I created my account.  

My suggestion, IGNORE THIS GAME IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AT ALL. Its not even worth wasting time on, since at random, you can have all your data reset for no other reason than a childish support person who is jealous that you found something they have not in game.</p>

      <p>1.) Padding out game time with not letting you teleport to your house. No idea why you'd even have a feature like that in a game like this, especially if it's on a 20 min cool down. 2.) I am not going to wait hours for crops to grow back. Leave that kind of thing to the MMORPGs. 3.) I've gotten quest where the person needed just doesn't show up on the map 4.) I get this is a cozy game but good lord is it just boring. Lame characters, lame story, tedious and grindy game play. Overall I couldn't recommend this to anyone with a straight face. Go play stardew vally or hell, even farming simulator for that matter.</p>
