      <h4>2 stars (Kimber Leigh Osborne, Google Play Store, 2024-05-09)</h4>
      <p>when taking the very first required photo of the storefront, the app force closes itself + instantly restarts from the beginning. I wait for it to reload, retake the picture, hit submit, + watch it once again force close itself + restart from the beginning. Repeat 20x. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing data, clearing the cache, different devices, different stores.. it's cost me legit $100s in missed opportunities. ⭐⭐ Is probably too generous. It's been like a year fix the bug damn</p>

      <p>Terrible experience, I try going slow and careful but the stitching is both atrocious and calls for a ridiculously tiny margin of error for a steady hand and viewing angle. It blew through 30% of my battery just after the first category (of 11) and constantly overheated my relatively new phone. Literally impossible to get the necessary work done using this app.</p>

      <p>The app needs to be improved. You can't use it at all. Doesn't work and stitching is poor. U spend time and money on tasks that are impossible to complete. Great concept, but please improve programming.</p>

      <p>Tried this 6 weeks ago with my Pixel 5a: the phone kept overheating, shutting down. I bought a frozen burrito, held that against my phone which didn't help much and after two hours in the store I gave up. I recently got a Pixel 8 Pro and tried again. I didn't have the extreme overheating issue but the app doesn't stitch very well and it doesn't take advantage of this great phones camera lenses, wide and ultra wide. So with one of the best phones available this app still doesn't work well at all.</p>

      <p>This app just cost me money! I didn't believe the reviews. Oh boy was I wrong, terrible for stitching, heats up your phone and drains the battery, I have a brand new phone and there is absolutely no reason it should cause this, it also start causing my system UI to fail, forcing my work app and phone system to close. I spent 30 minutes trying to get one objective competed and I couldn't even get through 1/2 of an isle.</p>
