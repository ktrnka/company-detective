<li>"Photos take forever to upload. Mine has sat at 86% for over 5 hours now and I may not get credit for the work and have to redo it all over again." <a href="https://apple/11340202573">(JewlsEvans, Apple App Store, 2024-06-03)</a></li>
<li>"2 years of negative experiences and the app still hasn't got better? SIGNIFICANT overheating issues, battery drains and poor stitching." <a href="https://google_play/43000a50-0375-47a1-ae57-ffc57d784839">(Neal Croswell, Google Play Store, 2024-02-11)</a></li>

<li>"My phone heated up so bad it was so hot to the touch. And the stitching was horrible." <a href="https://google_play/2a21e599-e00b-4c80-b367-368a45c40e14">(Megan Garcia, Google Play Store, 2024-06-16)</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Usability Challenges</h3>

<li>"Tried it today for the first time was not user friendly. A very disappointing app that really needs looked into." <a href="https://apple/11099065372">(Wing5112, Apple App Store, 2024-03-29)</a></li>
<li>"This app makes it very difficult to complete the required tasks. You can't fit all objects being asked to capture and I had to redo every photo over and over." <a href="https://google_play/a462c50c-f992-428a-8ee4-7bac632cd2a7">(Deanna Mason, Google Play Store, 2023-10-21)</a></li>

<li>"Tried for an hour to do a fifth of a task taking a stitched image that was supposed to take less than an hour total. The app will explicitly show you that the image will be fine and then simply won’t take them." <a href="https://apple/10560815372">(A Merry Berry, Apple App Store, 2023-11-07)</a></li>

<li>"The app needs to be improved. You can't use it at all. Doesn't work and stitching is poor." <a href="https://google_play/0295d8c3-7f54-43c0-8a85-1a19f478052b">(Sig t, Google Play Store, 2024-05-06)</a></li>

      <p>Works TERRIBLY. Spent 15 minutes lining up photos according to the instructions in this app and it guided me through taking them all skewed in an unusable way. It wouldn't accept anything that was correct. It also uses my macro camera by default and disables some important settings for correcting that. They overcomplicated it and ruined payment opportunities for a bunch of people. Deleted, and I'm dropping CW too. Nothing to offer!</p>

I bought a frozen burrito, held that against my phone which didn't help much and after two hours in the store I gave up. I recently got a Pixel 8 Pro and tried again. I didn't have the extreme overheating issue but the app doesn't stitch very well and it doesn't take advantage of this great phones camera lenses, wide and ultra wide. So with one of the best phones available this app still doesn't work well at all.</p>

      <p>Guess I should have known when I saw all the reviews for this app were negative. The store visit job task I was attempting to do unfortunately required this app for submitting the pictures. Because of this app I wasn’t able to complete the job as needed. When I got to the store and logged into the app for the first time the job wasn’t under the new tab as the video tutorial said it would be instead it showed up under submitted. When I selected it under submitted it wouldn’t let me open it to edit it or see what was submitted. I contacted Clobotics and still waiting for a response back. Very very frustrating as it cost me time, gas and money.</p>

      <h4>I have three issues. Which are frustrating, but not deal breakers., 4 stars (ddrdddddwerf rxdswaddf., Apple App Store, 2024-07-02)</h4>
      <p>I downloaded and use this app through Clickworker, the app is required to complete their “Jobs” US Store visits.(which is the main reason I use their platform).
 

1) DATA: The amount of storage and data needed for this app is CRAZY. It uses more data than all of my other apps combined! Which I really don’t understand if all of our photos are being uploaded to their cloud.

2) REVISTS: This happened to me both times I was requested to complete a revisit, both times due to missing an aisle in a specific category. So, I get to the store capture the required photos for the category that needed revision, and click upload. I immediately receive an error message stating to complete the remaining categories. Which you can’t even access the in app camera for those other categories. Only the categories that need revision had the little blue circle icon with the camera on it, that you need to click to open the camera. Needless to say I was frustrated because I did the required work but was unable to upload. Also, if we are asked to leave a store before we finish all the categories, I think it’s only fair to be compensated for the work we could complete. 
          >So, maybe instead of an error message, it could be a pop up message asking something like “You have uncompleted categories! Would you still like to submit your photos?”.  Just an idea

3) I use both my iPhone 13 and my Samsung Galaxy S21+ do complete these “Jobs”. Id much rather the Samsung due to the camera being zoomed out more. I timed it I completed a Job 3X faster on the Samsung. The Samsung captures more of the aisle in one shot. I seen another person have this same issue with iPhone. 
(when an aisle is over a 100 shots I usually just click the option to add more photos to that category, and continue a little bit further back than when I stopped. That way I  my stop and start spot overlaps, as to not miss any products. When there is more than one aisle I usual finish the first then upload, go back to the main screen, click on the category again that way it’s a fresh category. When I go back to my main screen in my list of categories, I’ll see the category twice.
           > It would be nice if there was a way I could access the zoom settings for the in app camera. That way I could adjust the zoom in or out, as needed.

Also, maybe an in app chat feature would be helpful for some. In case they get stuck or just have a general question. Other than that the app works as intended and is pretty much self explanatory.</p>

Why isn’t there a video or something showing a person who successfully completed the job using this evil & tortuous app. I’m convinced it’s Satan.

      <p>Photos take forever to upload. Mine has sat at 86% for over 5 hours now and I may not get credit for the work and have to redo it all over again. Took me over an hour. This is ridiculous. Do not use this app!!!!</p>

      <h4>It’s impossible to do with this, 1 stars (DBlanco, Apple App Store, 2024-05-23)</h4>
      <p>Stiffintiy wrote it accurately on Mar 20.
I worked for hours trying to get the aisle correct using video capture and photo capture. 
Both the video and the camera take small areas and it takes more then the maximum number of shots. The video is small range movements instead of being able to free move the camera you must match two circles and it’s slower than trying to do the photos.  It took hours to do 2 out of 11 tasks. 

We should be able to use our own phone camera.</p>

      <p>Tried it today for the first time was not user friendly. I tried to watch the tutorials on taking a quality shelf picture and it would not load or it would play for 15 seconds and stop. A very disappointing app that really needs looked into. Please do not waste your time.</p>

      <h4>Incredibly Frustrating, 1 stars (stiffinifty, Apple App Store, 2024-03-20)</h4>
      <p>I’ve tried this app at 3 different shops and was unsuccessful each time. The photo capture is unstable, the video mode requires literally over 100 captures to even get half of an average sized section of products. Once you get to 100 you can’t take any more and then can’t complete the row correctly. 

There is no information on what to do when this happens. None of the tutorials explain if you can submit more than one “set” at a time. 

Narrow aisles are impossible. The photo detection in “classic mode” never matches correctly and one wrong angle messes the whole thing up. It would be much faster and much more efficient if we were able to take the photos with our own regular photo app, use any run of the mill photo editor to stitch THOSE together and submit with a geolocation tag. 

Also, trying to find any help has been nearly impossible.</p>

      <p>Tried for an hour to do a fifth of a task taking a stitched image that was supposed to take less than an hour total. The app will explicitly show you that the image will be fine and then simply won’t take them. No error message, no explanation, just decides not to take the images. It is totally unusable and even if you can manage to figure it out it will take way longer than the pay could be worth.</p>

      <p>I’m unable to complete my assignments due to the constant glitching and freezing from this application. It also absorbs a chunk amount of phone battery. When it works it’s great. However,  when it glitches and freezes, especially during photo shoots, it’s frustrating process to complete one roll. It takes me hours to complete 4-5 rolls, rather than a few minutes. These issues slows down my productivity from completing the job. I hope the developers fix this problem and make a more user-friendly interface.</p>
