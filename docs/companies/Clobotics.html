      <p>Works TERRIBLY. Spent 15 minutes lining up photos according to the instructions in this app and it guided me through taking them all skewed in an unusable way. It wouldn't accept anything that was correct. It also uses my macro camera by default and disables some important settings for correcting that. They overcomplicated it and ruined payment opportunities for a bunch of people. Deleted, and I'm dropping CW too. Nothing to offer!</p>

      <p>when taking the very first required photo of the storefront, the app force closes itself + instantly restarts from the beginning. I wait for it to reload, retake the picture, hit submit, + watch it once again force close itself + restart from the beginning. Repeat 20x. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, clearing data, clearing the cache, different devices, different stores.. it's cost me legit $100s in missed opportunities. ⭐⭐ Is probably too generous.

      <p>Terrible experience, I try going slow and careful but the stitching is both atrocious and calls for a ridiculously tiny margin of error for a steady hand and viewing angle. It blew through 30% of my battery just after the first category (of 11) and constantly overheated my relatively new phone. Literally impossible to get the necessary work done using this app.</p>

      <p>Tried this 6 weeks ago with my Pixel 5a: the phone kept overheating, shutting down. I bought a frozen burrito, held that against my phone which didn't help much and after two hours in the store I gave up. I recently got a Pixel 8 Pro and tried again. I didn't have the extreme overheating issue but the app doesn't stitch very well and it doesn't take advantage of this great phones camera lenses, wide and ultra wide. So with one of the best phones available this app still doesn't work well at all.</p>
