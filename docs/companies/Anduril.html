        <h1>Customer experience</h1>
        <h2>COMPANY Anduril</h2>
<h3>Positive Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I don't think you're giving enough credit to Anduril. Also, Anduril's size is perfectly positioned for this kind of work. They have already proven that they are more than capable of meeting and exceeding contracts." (Hootblah1419, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
<li>"As a government acquisition person I’m also excited to see this. A new competitor is a good thing. Many current companies are deeply bloated due to following DODAF for decades, and it’s long past time for some young blood to come into the game." (Texasconsult, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critical Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Anduril is everything wrong with 21st century capitalism but giving the primes a wake up call that there’s other options out there is a win." (Fighter_pil0t, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
<li>"Their business model is defense as a subscription service. Heavy on marketing/sales and light on innovation and value." (Fighter_pil0t, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
<li>"Anduril’s workplace environment is fairly toxic, or used to be." (BenekCript, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employment and Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Just browsed their careers page. Roles seem interesting and compensation and benefits seem great." (Becominganastronaut, Reddit, 2024-04-25)</li>
</ul>
<h2>PRODUCT Anduril</h2>
<h3>Positive User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I really love Anduril. People say it is too complicated but rather I think it is like being able to make your torch function the way you want to without thinking 'I wish my light can do this', because with Anduril, you have less opportunity cost options to deal with." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb25yy5/">(tekkenshu7, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"I've found Anduril 2 to be really great to use and easy to configure. These charts are easy to follow and it was nice to be able to change a few things around to make the light output for how I typically use it." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kf0ybb8/">(TerranRepublic, Reddit, 2023-12-26)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mixed User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I like some of the features of Anduril 2. But I miss the ease of use yet flexibility of Anduril 1." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3rc98/">(Davidat0r, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"I like the idea of one light that is versatile and customizable and I don't mind doing some setup, but am getting the impression that Anduril has lots of uses I'm not interested in and isn't great for things that I prioritize…" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/">(GearGoblin42, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative User Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It is not a good UI for a tool. It is only nice for toys. Yes, it offers a lot of flexibility in some ways, but then it is absolutely rigid and not configurable at all in others." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty7syc/">(LXC37, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
<li>"It offers no way to lock configuration, so you always have a chance to screw something up by misclicking or something in the most inconvenient moment when you need the light to work." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty7syc/">(LXC37, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Complexity and Usability</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The diagram makes it look scary, but it's not. It's basically just 'click for on/off, hold to change brightness', and then there are a bunch of optional things available for people who want them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kbpgqgt/">(ToyKeeper, Reddit, 2023-12-02)</a></li>
<li>"Imagine telling Grandma...'yeah, that's the instructions. It's easy, I've got it memorized!'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb1bdl8/">(JNader56, Reddit, 2023-11-27)</a></li>
<li>"It should be a PDF with each configure tree having its own page, and a much simpler first page that lays out top-level commands." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3csp3/">(nanotom, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Turbo is still only level 150. There are 150 entries in the ramp table in <code>anduril.h</code> for each light, to represent levels 1-150." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95xgcj/">(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
<li>"I want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k96673f/">(notwerby2, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Value Perception</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I bought mine for 150$ but the quality is more like 50$." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/15xd6tz/do_not_buy_any_of_the_similar_looking_anduril/">(Witext, Reddit, 2023-08-21)</a></li>
<li>"The packaging even says that the order costs 40$ and I’m assuming that’s the real value." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/15xd6tz/do_not_buy_any_of_the_similar_looking_anduril/">(Witext, Reddit, 2023-08-21)</a></li>
