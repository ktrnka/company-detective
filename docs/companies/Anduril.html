<li>"The HD10 only has small colored leds for aux. In newer anduril versions they can be enabled as main channels but they only have the two brightness levels you can see when they are in aux mode." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty2h4q/">(Pocok5, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
<li>"Unfortunately that is not possible, we can not make the Aux have ramping brightness." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty79bm/">(jon_slider, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>

<li>"I want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/">(notwerby2, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
<li>"Turbo is still only level 150." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95xgcj/">(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
<li>"I don't use Turbo at all.. to me it is a waste of batteries. Turbo only lasts for a brief moment, and then the light steps down rapidly and drops to a much lower level." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95y1wn/">(jon_slider, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
<li>"I have had an anduril 1 light before (d4) but I'm really used to the 2 stage switch on my nitecore mh20gt, and even though I do agree anduril 2 gives you so much customization, there was something pleasantly simple about being able to long full press to get turbo." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k9ox6yf/">(notwerby2, Reddit, 2023-11-17)</a></li>
<li>"If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to 'high' on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/">(notwerby2, Reddit, 2023-11-14)</a></li>
