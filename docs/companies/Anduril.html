<li>"That pommel mirrors the blade's edge, meaning the blade and the curve of the handle match angles." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j61mqum/">(investlike_a_warrior, Reddit, 2023-01-27)</a></li>
<li>"The larger pommel probably helps a lot with balance." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60zw0r/">(point50tracer, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>
<li>"Because it can be used both one and two handed, which was done quite a bit historically with different techniques." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j5zergd/">(Nerdthenord, Reddit, 2023-01-26)</a></li>
<li>"I'm just glad all of the 'core' functionality is still easy to use. I've found Anduril 2 to be really great to use and easy to configure." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kf0ybb8/">(TerranRepublic, Reddit, 2023-12-26)</a></li>

<h3>Mixed Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"I just got my first Anduril light today, and after playing with it and the flow chart I immediately thought it would be so much better to have a software UI to go with it on mobile or desktop." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb34oa7/">(henlohowdy, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"I think really the main point of Anduril is its 'set and forget' feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb25yy5/">(tekkenshu7, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"The diagram makes it look scary, but it's not. It's basically just 'click for on/off, hold to change brightness', and then there are a bunch of optional things available for people who want them." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kbpgqgt/">(ToyKeeper, Reddit, 2023-12-02)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li>"This chart is a nightmare in terms of making the necessary information available and easy to understand." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb2spza/">(rm-minus-r, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"Never thought I'd say it but I'll say it - There is too much. It's too complicated." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb1g816/">(FlipSide26, Reddit, 2023-11-27)</a></li>
<li>"I enjoy tinkering and nerding out over things like torches but when I see this my honest reaction is 'I'm not reading that'." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3j1xn/">(Geromegoons, Reddit, 2023-11-28)</a></li>
<li>"It is not a good UI for a tool. It is only nice for toys." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty7syc/">(LXC37, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
<li>"It offers a lot of flexibility in some ways, but then it is absolutely rigid and not configurable at all in others." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1gczdal/did_i_buy_the_wrong_light_wurkkos_hd10_anduril/lty7syc/">(LXC37, Reddit, 2024-10-27)</a></li>
