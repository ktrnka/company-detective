As of September 2024, Anduril employs over 3,500 people, marking a significant growth from the previous year <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/06/defense-tech-startup-anduril-hiring-manufacturing-capacity-us-air-force-fighter-jets/">(Mathews et al., Fortune, 2024-09-06)</a>.</p>

<h2>Company Culture and Work Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I think really the main point of Anduril is its 'set and forget' feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time.

<li>"It definitely did sound like working over 40 was somewhat expected, but maybe not more than that. Their compensation package seemed extremely good, so you'll likely get paid well there for your time." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/1do4dcn/anduril_work_culture/la7ofay/">(Pirate_with_rum, Reddit, 2024-06-25)</a></li>
