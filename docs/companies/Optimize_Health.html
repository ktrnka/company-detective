<p>Optimize Health, founded on January 1, 2015, in Seattle, Washington, is a company specializing in remote healthcare solutions, particularly Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). The company was initially focused on medication adherence but pivoted to RPM following the introduction of reimbursement for RPM by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). This strategic shift was driven by the founders' recognition of technology's potential to enhance patient engagement and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/optimize-health">(Crunchbase, 2025)</a>.</p>
